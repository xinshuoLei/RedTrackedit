Stop leaving your shit at your desk only to return over an hour later. I don't care if you're saving a seat for your friend, I got here first and I'm taking the damn seat.

I'm sick of seeing people leave a measly phone charger or notebook in an effort to ""reserve"" the desk for themselves when there's literally so many other people who are actually trying to get some work done.

For those not in the loop

* Professor changed exam question to a significantly easier question with 20 minutes left, after several students have finished.
* Students began to bring up concerns about that question on piazza, to no result.
* The final project was released, and it was wildly confusing and disorganized. It covers a topic not taught in class and is all around poorly worded.
   * Students bring up concerns regarding this on piazza, again to no real response.
* Professor states that specific project related questions should be held until discussion section or office hours of which there are very few left until the due date.
* Many other small issues

What is there for students to do about this? Frustrations have gone largely ignored and grades are sure to absolutely plummet if something is not done.

Wanted to open this up to discussion, see if anyone has opinions defending 361 staff's actions because I genuinely want to know. If they have a reason for not responding to the exam questions I am open to hearing it and accepting it, but so far we have heard nothing.",9

On the UIUC Mental Health Crisis,86,e70tqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/e70tqp/on_the_uiuc_mental_health_crisis/,55,1575677893.0,"Considering the ongoing frustration regarding the lack of mental health services here on campus, I felt that it would be beneficial to actually ask someone informed on the topic about it. As such, I went to the College of Applied Health Sciences and asked a professor about it. Here is what I learned:

- UIUC is actively recruiting mental health professionals and has been for some time.

- There is currently a massive nation-wide shortage of said professionals, especially psychiatrists.

-This deficit is partly due to large numbers of people self-diagnosing or otherwise inundating the current system. 

-UIUC is not particularly attractive to psychiatrists as they can be paid better elsewhere, as well as in better locations than ours. As such, few wish to work here.

Now, I understand everyone’s frustration, but frankly the circumstances surrounding this particular issue are largely beyond the control of the University. Why would a psychiatrist chose to work here when they would be paid public service rates, live surrounded by cornfields, and have to service a population who by and large would be unwilling to leave the situation that is causing them such discomfort (college) while at the same time working for said environment? As such, people need to step back a bit and find other solutions as this situation is likely not changing anytime soon.",86

What's your opinion on public transportation?,0,e7jser,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/e7jser/whats_your_opinion_on_public_transportation/,11,1575780816.0,"I've always been a big fan of all kinds of transportation vehicles, such as planes, trains, cars, etc. Recently I watched a couple videos on YouTube about why public transportation/train sucks in the US (They actually make some sense. Watch it: [https://youtu.be/-cjfTG8DbwA](https://youtu.be/-cjfTG8DbwA)).

I'm from downtown and I went to high school in downtown as well so during those days I went to school by subway everyday. I'm glad public transportation exists bc I didn't have to ask my parents to drive me to school.

Now I'm staying in this rural Chambana area with my car. Indeed, it feels really good. I no longer worried about super bad traffic and ridiculously pricey parking. But my life here before having a car was still pretty tough. I could barely get outta campustown.

I don't talk to people very often irl but I'm curious about others' opinions on this topic. These opinions don't have to be specifically for public transportation in Chambana. They can be for anywhere, or for public transportation in general. Feel free to share your thoughts here. Appreciated.

As some of you may know, this demonstration was originally a final project that was conducted under our professor that grew into something big. The original plan was to have it during our class time today (9:30 Am) but the University advised us to cancel because our class was in violation of a University policy. If our class were to participate in it, we could face disciplinary action. This was just us though, other students outside of our class could’ve demonstrated as they intended. 

So, what now? 

We aren’t done at all. We are currently planning on a time where we will hold the demonstration, one where we aren’t in class and in “violation of a policy.” Either way, it will happen. We don’t know when the demonstration will be, but we still are AN ACTIVE ORGANIZATION. We will keep you updated once we get the exact demonstration time and date. 

This isn’t it, we’re not done fighting. Stay tuned!

Student Concerns are Being Ignored in CS 361,31,e6ig7d,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/e6ig7d/student_concerns_are_being_ignored_in_cs_361/,17,1575587378.0,"There have been a few Reddit posts about this class lately, but I really do not know who to turn to about student concerns being ignored. 

Here are the two main concerns:

* Two exam changes more than halfway through Midterm 2. [This](https://i.imgur.com/FSduFO4.png) was posted to Piazza on November 12, 2019.
* The project in general. See a summary [here](https://i.imgur.com/7CEaHdg.png). Concerns were posted on December 2, 2019, and the project is due on December 10, 2019. (For transparency's sake, the project was introduced in class on November 19, 2019 and was officially released to the students in PDF format on November 22, 2019.)

Neither of the above posts have received a response from either the professor or the TA's. The TA's avoid these posts but give answers like [this](https://i.imgur.com/4oTTWF7.png) and [this](https://i.imgur.com/cUvbeDX.png) on other posts. And when asked in lecture to address these concerns, the professor seems to try to avoid the question entirely. Despite one of the TA's repetitive answer of ""you do not need to Google anything (except the first question)"", another student who has made significant progress on the project (kudos to him/her) admitted that he/she had to do ""extensive google searches"" ([source](https://i.imgur.com/3YTYmce.png)).

It seems that the CS department is aware that there are problems in this class, but there seems to be no way of relieving students of these problems this semester. I have resigned myself to just doing the project with extensive Googling, but what bothers me the most is that the professor and TA's just seem to not care. Nobody on course staff seems to want to admit that maybe there is a problem with changing exam questions more than halfway through the exam and that maybe there is a problem with the project itself.",31

It is rude towards the people who legitimately have a severe chemical imbalance in their brain and suffer a constant and persisting sadness. Just because you're studying constantly and you got a 79% on your quiz and your life is over freshman year here, is just you not being mentally strong enough to stomach the actual value of your work. UIUC has garbage college culture, especially for being a massive school in the Big 10. This isn't the fault of any specific person, but the people as a whole who attend. UIUC has a culture synonymous with hard working, incredibly intelligent people. People who are complaining about their mental health, are the ones who make this school so unappealing to athletes. Nobody goes to the basketball games, the football stadium is considered packed when it's only 2/3rds full, Bama sells out every single game for the past 6 years, we have no mascot or symbol to rally around, our chants stink, we have crappy parties after every frat got popped, and frankly tuition is way to messed up. UIUC has the closest culture to an Ivy league university next too Duke, Purdue, and Stanford. We're the cause of the depression epidemic, people really are staying in the study for econ 202 rather than supporting the basketball team with their friends and engaging in the campus lifestyle. All the Uni can do is provide resources or activities for people, honestly people who are self diagnosed and just can't take the hit to their ego that they're a B- to D+ student. Clinical depression is a serious problem that nobody wants to talk about, and getting resources on campus can only help. BUT, if your depression is rooted in the fact you're so stressed because you don't want a 75% on a random 4 point clicker quiz, or you just don't feel like supporting your fellow classmates; that is on you. If you have refused to actively go out and do anything to make yourself happy, what good will complaining about resources you will need to go to, but won't cuz u don't feel like it, do?",0

My first ability is to provide information on classes offered here at Illinois!  You can call me to fetch information about a course by typing the “course rubric” or CRNs in square brackets.  For example:

* `[cs225]`, will call me since it is a course in square brackets,
* `[Cs225]`, I don’t have case-sensitivity,
* `[CS 225]`, a space between the subject and course is fine,
* `[31208]`, and I understand five-digit CRNs, too!

You can call me in any comment or post on r/uiuc only and I’ll combine up to 10 different courses into a post so you can share your full schedule to let others know what you’re taking: like `[cs107] [hort107] [cs225] and also [cs241]`.

The cost they projected was $5600/yr plus a $700 one time set up fee. If this university paid the same or more, they might want to rethink it. 

The [Campus Well](https://he.studenthealth101.com/) group posts interesting stats about satisfaction of students when marketing to schools. 

If this paltry amount of money (in the grand scheme of operating a university) is what the administration is throwing towards Wellness/Mental health versus trying to find a better solution to help students they should be ashamed.

The rent is estimated to be $315 per person, plus our own utilities. Adding that, it will probably be \~$360 per person, give or take. 

If you are interested, just contact me through Reddit messages and we can talk! I've had previous success on this subreddit and we're generally chill guys, so don't be afraid to contact!

If you have any questions either about the property, me or my roommate, or etc. I can always answer in messages.

Thank you!",3

And, we are excited to announce the launch of a new student wellness enforcement initiative called the Be Well Gestapo. In order to create a more healthy and constructive campus, all those suspected of neurologically divergent behavior will be captured and subject to interrogation and potential execution in the basement of Altgeld Hall. Examples of neurologically divergent or degenerative behaviors include:

* Stress
* Poor academic performance
* Use of alcohol or other drugs
* Sexual activities
* Suicidal thoughts or acts
* Depressive episodes
* Anxiety
* Complaints or displeasure with the existence of the Be Well Gestapo
* Criticism of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
* Fear of capture by the Be Well Gestapo
* Non-compliance with expected hygiene standards
* And, much more!

We encourage all students to immediately report any and all unsettling or suspicious behavior exhibited by your peers. All reports found to be legitimate will enter the reporting party in a raffle to win a $50 Amazon gift card.  We look forward to a healthier and more productive campus in our future!",155

Hello there everyone!

The Altgeld Ringers have had quite the eventful semester so far. We’ve hosted a number of events:

* A Quad Day concert celebrating the new academic year and honoring 400 years of African American history in conjunction with the National Park Service
* Two concerts in mourning and in honor of Sue Wood, our Chimesmaster from 1994 to 2017
* A 99^(th) birthday celebration for the Senior Memorial Chime on October 30, 2019
* A concert showcasing our spooky repertoire on Halloween
* (And we will host) a concert celebrating the winter season & its holidays on Reading Day

We’ve worked very hard to make the campus community a little brighter, whether it be by lifting up your spirits as the bells ring out into campus, *finally* arranging and playing “Megalovania” at the request of hundreds of students, or even [helping you pop the big question](https://www.facebook.com/AltgeldChimes/posts/2328982407412463?__xts__[0]=68.ARDED0faY6GU9_6g0XKjNDAVpCMOnvYEU6qtGYrnK4xgcm9Z-4XwMQ-ETpcSrr9dgZeIsCNxNKSlQLdHpdayBNRRBDIZ6C536gFPYTI-dbhpA0Jm3njCcdgbYtQ-VsOLCyacuSFGoL_tJfiQ3D8c7gZG87Pz8Kv9PWNe3BAqJ43E3SNk-Fsgb1_48vjt3xJan5Bxh5yZt0vrX7TL5NPTenWdug60F-NPs05-PBOQrKFCVEHPe1tmNxIKby5Mmqyh_yJBiXCxCwcu1k3Y9U6PqK01CchKBJvVUeNkhdV1Nz0joSgDN3nBDmYbfHqQiJavIvRRPHz3ukpFlPSyc1qMxNoNseUS&__tn__=-R).

We’re hoping that next year we can achieve all of this community involvement again. Especially because next year is our beloved bells’ 100^(th) birthday! This is quite the impressive feat, as most university chime systems across the country have fallen silent over time. To celebrate, we hope to host a major 100^(th) Anniversary event next October, which will require planning and funding starting now.

As you may already know, we are a volunteer, student-run organization that play the chimes nearly every day school is in session. We therefore need to ask for donations, both from campus and community to fund anything we do. If you have ever enjoyed the presence of the Senior Memorial Chime during your time at the University, please consider donating to [our GoFundMe page](https://www.gofundme.com/f/altgeld-chime039s-100th-Anniversary?utm_source=customer&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_campaign=p_cp+share-sheet) (created by Tina Horton, chimesmaster). This is a fantastic way to contribute to your campus community. We will use this money to fund next year’s big bell-ringing birthday bash; anything left over will support us into the future!

Thank you,

The Altgeld Ringers",11

Technology Services understands this kind of disruption affects every facet of life, student, and business at the University of Illinois, including our own. Returning IllinoisNet to a steady, reliable state is our organization's number one priority. Please bear with us as we work with our vendors to identify a long-term solution to these problems.

# Temporary Solutions

IllinoisNet\_Guest is accessible for people who are experiencing issues. However, as other threads have pointed out, there is limited space on the guest network.

After connecting to IllinoisNet\_Guest, you may need to open a browser and try to visit a website such as [illinois.edu](https://illinois.edu/). Then, you will be redirected to a page where you can log in with your NetID and password.

Once you have successfully been able to connect back to IllinoisNet, we recommend removing IllinoisNet\_Guest from your saved networks to prevent situations where your device will try and bounce between networks.

Computer labs or locations with wired connections are not affected and will continue to connect to the campus network.

I've been struggling with chronic pain this entire semester and have yet to get a diagnosis. I've been able to get by doing my work, but I'm in too much pain to even sit or attend class. I contacted DRES but they aren't able to provide accommodations until I have the diagnosis (which I will hopefully have after my diagnostic surgery soon). I'd prefer not to tell my professor the details of what's going on. He has some idea because I've given him doctor's notes for missed class a couple times before. I'm just worried a doctor's note won't suffice for the final presentation. Also, I can't get an absence letter from the dean until after missing the class.

Luckily most of my finals are submitted online besides this one presentation. It seems like at this point my only option is to just not go and get a zero for the final, although I really can't afford to do this since it is one of my major classes.

Does anyone have any advice? Should I just give my professor a regular doctor's note and hope for the best? Is there any other resource out there for this situation?",4

Transfer Requirement (Math major),0,e555uz,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/e555uz/transfer_requirement_math_major/,12,1575348137.0,"I'm a Math major and planning to transfer to UIUC in FA20.

This is what I read on Transfer Handbook:

An additional ***requirement*** for junior-level transfer is completion of a transfer equivalent to one of the following University of Illinois courses: **CS 101, Intro Computing: Engrg & Sci or CS 105, Intro Computing: Non-Tech or CS 125, Intro to Computer Science**

&#x200B;

So my question is, 

I can't even get a change to be considered as an applicant if I didn't take one of these Computer Science courses before transfer even though I'm a math major? Or, am I still eligible for applying?

&#x200B;

UIUC is the only one college that requires me to take CS course for transfer. (UT Austin, GAtech, UF, etc. don't tell me to take CS course, cause' I'm a Math major) 

I mean I don't really want to pay $1,000 for just one computer course that I can only use to transfer to one college.

“I see that they’ve blocked off the corner of Daniel and Sixth Street with fencing. Will they finally be demolishing those buildings? Has the city announced what will be built there?

“A demolition permit was issued on Nov. 22 for 602-618 E Daniel St.” said Randy Smith, building safety supervisor with the city of Champaign. “There is currently a permit under review for 812 S. 6th for multi-family residential and retail.”

The developer, said Champaign Planning and Development Director Bruce Knight, is Core Spaces, based in Chicago.

The company’s website describes the property as The James and describes it as a nearly 350,000 square foot development with more than 20,000 square feet of retail.It will have 322 housing units with 658 beds. It appears to be 16 or 17 stories high.

The company develops, acquires and manages housing projects in many college towns, including West Lafayette, East Lansing, Ann Arbor, Madison and Minneapolis.",152

I know other factors play into the decision, but let’s assume everything else is good enough, like ECs and essays.

I want the opinion of you guys since there is not too much info online on the Psychology program other than the freshman academic profile. According to that, their middle 50% GPA range is from 3.35 to 3.8, which seems absurdly low...

All locations posted below were obtained using Google Maps and may not be too accurate.

1. Boneyard Creek seems to originate at 40°07'27.8""N 88°14'17.8""W, (or at least, this is as far as I was able to track it backwards). This is a spot just to the north of downtown Champaign.
2. Boneyard Creek goes through the UofI campus and Urbana, and eventually joins with an unnamed waterflow to form the Saline Branch Drainage Ditch at 40°07'11.9""N 88°12'01.2""W, in north Urbana.
3. The Saline Branch Drainage Ditch joins with the Salt Fork at 40°07'02.0""N 88°03'07.3""W, near Interstate 74 and between Urbana and Danville.
4. The Salt Fork meanders around and eventually joins with the Middle Fork Vermilion River to form the Vermilion River at 40°06'12.9""N 87°43'01.3""W, just to the west of Danville.
5. The Vermilion River crosses into Indiana and joins the Wabash River shortly afterwards, at 39°57'31.2""N 87°26'23.3""W.
6. The Wabash River goes south along the Illinois-Indiana border, and eventually joins the Ohio River at 37°48'03.5""N 88°01'25.2""W, which is at the intersection of Illinois, Indiana, and Kentucky.
7. The Ohio River goes southwest along the Illinois-Kentucky border, and eventually joins the Mississippi river at 36°59'02.3""N 89°07'46.8""W, which is at the intersection of Illinois, Kentucky, and Missouri.
8. The Mississippi river goes south and eventually drains into the Gulf of Mexico south of New Orleans around 29°10'N 89°15'W.",277

I had to pay the security deposit so I went to the tenant portal of paid it off. To pay it off I had to give them my bank username and password. 

It claimed it was using a software called Plaid that wouldn't let University Group see my credentials. I tried to find the normal way of paying it using an echeck and just putting in my routing account number but it didn't let me. The only way to pay with echeck was to sign into my bank account. 

The sign in page to my account was still on their website. The url was still appfolio not a bank url.

I googled what Plaid was because I have never heard of it before, all the results on google said it was trustworthy and so I logged in and I paid it. 

Two days later I get an email saying someone is trying to change my bank password. The next day some one in Ohio is using my debit card. Funny thing is my debit card was in my wallet.

I know there are other ways some one can steal a card like card skimmers at a gas station. However, I never use my debit card, I only use my credit card.

Now I have no evidence that directly links university group to the theft. But I do think that such a thing happening within 48 hours of logging into my bank through their site is a bit suspicious.

Has anyone else had a similar experience?

Personally, I think the time period where Abraham Lincoln was working as a prairie lawyer (and later, politician) in Illinois would be most appropriate for an Illinois mascot, but my dad thought President Lincoln was more of an iconic look, so I drew that version as well.

Peoria Charter Thanksgiving Travel Advice,218,dznho7,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/dznho7/peoria_charter_thanksgiving_travel_advice/,21,1574389475.0,"Hello UIUC Redditors!

Peoria Charter is looking at another record-breaking travel weekend for Thanksgiving Break! I wanted to share some advice for smooth travel and answer any questions you may have. Here is some tips for stress-free travel this Thursday-Sunday:

* **Arrival to Bus Stop-** Make sure to arrive at least 15 MINUTES before the departure time. There will be many runs that have multiple buses departing. We will try to start loading buses early so that we can depart on time. You should know which destination you are going to (Ex. O'Hare Terminal 2, Union Station, Woodfield Mall, Ect.). There will be 5-10 buses at some of the stops and if you do not know which destination you are going to, it is difficult to tell you which bus to board.

* **Boarding Location-** Board at the location on the ticket! Not all of the buses will be going to our 4 regular pick up points. If you need to change the boarding spot, please call our 24/7 Call Center. There is no charge to change the boarding location as long as the time does not change.

* **Tickets-** The tickets do not need to be printed (but can be if you prefer). Make sure to have the ticket pulled up on your phone, tablet or laptop because we will be scanning the QR Code for the boarding process. The easiest/smoothest way to do this is to screenshot the ticket and just pull it up on your phone.

* **Ticket Transfers-** We recommend calling our 24/7 Call Center if you miss your bus or need to change your time. In person, cash transfers can only be done at the ISR loading point. It is $10 to transfer a ticket.

* **24/7 Call Center Number is 800-448-0572-** We recommend asking one of our representatives at the pick up spot if you are able to do so. As you can imagine, the phone lines can be incredibly busy over this weekend, so if you see someone in a Red Peoria Charter Jacket feel free to ask them the question instead of calling.

* **WiFi-** With a bus load of 50 people trying to use the same internet connection, the internet will be slow TBH. We highly recommend using the Netflix/Spotify features where you can download videos/music on a WiFi network ahead of time and then watch/listen to them on the bus, instead of trying to stream on the free WiFi. Not all the buses will have WiFi. We wish they would, but to be realistic, there will be some that it is not working or it is not fitted with WiFi. (Sorry!)

* **Which Bus is Mine?-** Peoria Charter will be operating many trips with our own equipment this weekend, but we will also be receiving help from our industry partner bus companies. This means that the bus you ride on may not say Peoria Charter on the side. NOTE: If there is any bus at the spot where you should be boarding (no matter what the name on the bus is) ASK and make sure that is not your bus. There will be Peoria Charter employees in Red Vests directing people to the correct buses.

* **Luggage Policy-**  Peoria Charter allows two (2) pieces of luggage per passenger stored under the bus for free. Each customer may also bring one (1) small piece of baggage on the coach also known as ""carry-on"". Carry-on baggage would include items such as a backpack, small duffel bag, computer bag, shopping bag, any bag larger than a tablet. Pillows, laptops, sensitive musical instruments would not count as carry on and may be brought on board for no additional cost. Suitcases or any baggage with wheels are not considered as ""carry-on” items and must be stored under the bus. Any additional baggage or carry-on will be $10.00 per item if extra luggage space is available. If the driver deems that there is insufficient space available on the coach to safely store the extra baggage, then any extra baggage may be refused. The maximum allowable weight for checked baggage is 70 pounds per individual piece of baggage. Baggage must not exceed 63 inches when adding the total exterior dimensions of the piece (length + width + height). If these quantities are exceeded, there will be a $10.00 charge for each additional checked piece, paid to the driver, if space is available. (Copy & Pasted from the ticket T&C)


We want everyone to have a safe and relaxing travel experience so feel free to reach out to us if you have any concerns. By noting this information, your trip is much more likely to be stress-free! Feel free to ask me any questions you may have and I will do my best to answer them in a timely manor. Have a great Thanksgiving Break!",218

Chinese Students and Why They Agitate Us,0,dzexwi,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/dzexwi/chinese_students_and_why_they_agitate_us/,16,1574344873.0,"I have studied in both the US and China and have seen how both Chinese and Americans act when they go to the other's country to study. There is a problem, and it is very simple. It is twofold.  First, most Chinese students coming to America for a 2+ year stay, probably around 75% or so, do not have an interest in American culture. Second, some of them (perhaps 10%) come over with a very strong nationalist attitude (爱国主义、民族主义) and engage in a kind of subdued culture war with Americans they meet. Maybe 0% of the people even think of ""when in Rome, do as the Romans do,"" instead they have a similar but different idea (入乡随俗) which they interpret to mean that it is fine for them to set up a student ghetto with a mini-China at the University. Famously, these attitudes culminated in the Columbia University CSSA being shut down by the school in 2015.

This is the opposite of Americans going to China to study, where just about 100% have a strong interest in Chinese culture. After about three or four years of study, the average American student in China is being called an ""egg"", white on the outside but yellow on the inside. Matthew Hartzell, who wrote an answer here, got this down so well that he became something of an internet icon of friendship with America. He worked really hard to master the culture and reach out to Chinese and became something of a mini-celebrity.

The Chinese experience is much different.  The average Chinese student will arrive and meet Americans and engage in a wide variety of behavior that will offend, gross out, or alienate their new American friends. A lot of this behavior will be absolutely over the top, and it should be plainly obvious to them that what they're doing is unacceptable. At the end of the day, this really culminates in a large percentage of American universities being transformed into an insular, exclusive Chinese-speaking enclave that wants nothing to do with the American campus. The last thing that American universities need is this level of insularity and segregation, especially when it comes at the cost of pushing out American students who can't afford to pay skyrocketing tuition fees being driven in part by rich foreign students.

But because they lack an interest in American culture, they are completely oblivious to all of this. Many of them quite frankly think that all America wants is money, and if they show up with a wad of cash, it means they can do whatever they want and Americans will be happy with it.",0

I am a very cautious person and knowing that I want to be a CPS teacher I decided to look at job postings in the cook county area just to see how difficult it would be to find a job teaching earth science. I wasn't able to find very much of anything maybe one or two job postings and got scared that I would never be able to find a job. I aslo have the self-esteem of a slab of ham on the side of the Eisenhower and didn't think Id be good enough to be accepted ended up applying to middle grades education hoping to do a science or math emphasis instead because I thought my application and high school career would be more likely to get me accepted into it. I am kinda realizing now though that Id rather major in geology and teach earth science at the high school level more than the middle school level. I had tricked myself into settling and wish I had not done that. Is there anyway to change my major once i find out if i was accepted?,1

Where to go/who to see on campus when you can't get your programming environment to work?,5,dy7gkj,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/dy7gkj/where_to_gowho_to_see_on_campus_when_you_cant_get/,14,1574131846.0,"I often find myself having issues with getting python/C++/java/etc.  languages to download to my computer and I have issues with downloading their libraries/modules.   For some reason, I have terrible luck with this stuff, and when everyone else is able to get everything to run with something like ""pip3 install pytorch"", I have to waste hours (sometimes days) debugging and trying to figure it out.   And I know these are supposed to be ""one time things"", but I've had bad luck and I had to reinstall windows twice this year (windows corrupted update the first time, hard drive broke the second time).

It's awful, and stackoverflow often doesn't have a working solution to my problem.

Office hours doesn't really help much either, as usually there are many students with ""real questions"", or the TA/CA tells me to use google.

Sure, fine, I suppose it isn't their job to debug my installation.....

But if I \*truly\* cannot things to work on my lapp, whose job is it?  Because I'm at a brick wall if nobody else is able to intervene.  If I can't test my code on my computer, then I can't do my assignments.I'd pay som\*efkguone if I could, but people in CS usually value time over \[small\] sums of money.

Would it be like that tech services place in Siebel? Or that other one in DCL? Or is it actually the job of a TA/CA to help me get things working? If none of those, is there some third party place I can get things taken care of?

EDIT: I truly hate the useless mf who are commenting on this post to just ""figure it out myself"" and ""look at stack overflow"".  Your comments are less than useless. They are a waste of time to you and me and they piss me off extraordinarily. Read the damn post, the premise of this question is ""who can I go to when googling things doesn't work?""  Quit responding with ""I usually read carefully and use google.""  You're completely ignoring the question.

EDIT 2: for reasons I can't explain, it works now. i didn't even reboot my computer since last night, so I'm saying this is witchcraft 😵.     however, for future students reference and for my own, please lmw of any resources you can think of.",5

The Truth About Squirrel Watchers,123,dxdgi4,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/dxdgi4/the_truth_about_squirrel_watchers/,10,1573970509.0,"If you have ever been on a prospective student tour, or seen any of them as you walked between your classes, you have likely heard the tale of the Squirrel Watchers. A fun-filled, light-hearted group of individuals who gather to observe the many squirrels on campus. You may even have heard the tale of the Squirrel-Watchers-Watchers, those who observe the first club. You likely chuckled as you heard this, and then moved on, giving it no further thought. Just another quirk of a large university, not the weirdest thing on campus, totally plausible. 

What if I told you the Squirrel Watching Club, and the club of those who observed it, never existed at all? That it was a falsehood, conjured by the university to lure in prospective students? You may be doubtful. Why would they lie about this? What would they have to gain? The answer is - everything.

My sources indicate that the U of I has prospective student tours every day. Let’s average out tour size and assume each contains twenty-five prospective students. The acceptance rate to U of I is approximately sixty-six percent. If we assume two thirds of those who go on prospective tours eventually choose UIUC, and that two thirds of those are accepted, then 45% of each tour will eventually attend, or about eleven students per tour.

According to [this source](https://www.news-gazette.com/news/ui-s-record-breaking-freshman-class-most-in-state-residents/article_591c04e6-45c9-5795-b64e-22a2a064524a.html), three fourths of freshman are in-state and thus pay in-state tuition. Since in-state tuition is $15k, and out-of-state is $30k, the weighted average tuition per student per semester is $18.75k. 

According to[ this source](https://www.collegefactual.com/colleges/university-of-illinois-at-urbana-champaign/paying-for-college/financial-aid/), about half of students get an offer of $20k in scholarships and grants. Thus, the average student gets half of $20k off, or $10k off. This brings our average semesterly payment for the student down to $8.75k.

Thus, given the eleven eventual students in the tour, and the $8.75k cost per semester per student, the typical tour contains  $770,000 dollars of value for UIUC, assuming each student who attends does so for eight semesters.  That’s a lot of money, especially for a place like the U of I. If you were in their place, wouldn’t it be tempting to make up a fun little story, to make the students just a little more likely to pick you? If you doubt me, and you still believe in these “Squirrel Watchers”, then go ahead and try to attend one of their meetings. Try to even find information on their meetings. Or their membership. Or any indication at all that they ever existed. Go on, I’ll wait.

Now that we have established both the crime and the motive, what remains to be done? Well, my fellow students, consider this: what if we revealed the truth to these prospective students? Well, assuming that this revelation instills enough doubt in their hearts to sway one person off of choosing the U of I in each tour group, then that drops revenue from $770k to $700k. A loss of $70k. 

And that’s just for one tour. If you did this for a week, you would cost the university $350k. If you made this your mission, and did it every day for your four years here, you would in total cost the university a whopping forty-five million dollars. 

There are forty-five million dollars at stake. What would you do with that kind of power? Well start imagining buddy, because it’s real and it’s yours. Stay woke.",123

Questions from a prospective transfer student,4,dwjrq2,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/dwjrq2/questions_from_a_prospective_transfer_student/,3,1573811918.0,"I’m a current freshman at a different university, applying to transfer into UIUC in Fall 2020. I’m not super worried about getting in - I was accepted as a freshman but declined the offer, and I’m in good academic standing at my current school. Anyway, I’ve visited the campus and talked with some friends who go to Illinois, but I still have a few questions:

1. Is it easy to make friends on campus? At my current school, people are very unfriendly and keep to themselves. I’m moderately introverted but of course I still enjoy hanging out with people. I can do parties in moderation, but really I’d just love to meet a chill group of friends who like to hang out without all the hoopla of bars and crowded dance floors and loud music. Will I be able to find my people here?

2. What’s safety like? I currently go to school in a big city, and I feel pretty safe on campus but I get nervous walking home from an off-campus location after dark. I have not been a victim of crime, but the crime rate is high, and I have been accosted/sexually harassed, which has made me nervous. Obviously UIUC isn’t in a big city, but I’m nervous about a different type of safety. There’s that whole frat-boy sexual assailant stereotype, and I currently go to a school where frats aren’t a major thing, so I don’t know how much truth there is to that stereotype. How cautious should one be on UIUC’s campus? Would you consider this to be a safe place?

3. What’s something you think I should know about UIUC before becoming a student here?

It’s especially helpful in the dorms where you have absolutely no control over how much the heater is on.  This is just an awareness post that you don’t just have to suffer. Also if you do get one you really need to make sure to use filtered/distilled (putting it through the Britta filter has always worked for me) water to avoid covering everything nearby in calcium dust and you also need to clean it every so often with bleach or hydrogen peroxide so you’re not spewing mold and bacteria around.

If you take this class you are gonna learn how to make the Alvin and the Chipmunks effect thru straight Matlab (spoiler: FFT on an audio waveform), how satellites can maintain the same internal clocks with comm stations on the Earth's surface and other satellites while accounting for the latency of the signal travel (spoiler: idk i didn't really understand this part of the class), how any step counter app will count your steps (you build a step counter app from scratch via the sensors on your phone), see real world applications of a class's material (prof Romit will bring up from time to time how he has worked with some company / industry entity over trying to solve a problem that is related to the current instruction, for ex: UBER - find a passenger's location in an airport aka meter precision, a giant cricket league in Europe - IOT cricket ball that tracks different metrics of the pitch...), and more.

SUGGESTED pre-req: 

Matrix theory, though I didnt take any matrix theory before the class and did fine (re: I deadass didn't do one homework out of the two and got rekt on the only exam but got B cuz my mps are beast), the class does a sprint over matrix theory stuffs at the beginning

Calc 3, just because there is some vector analysis at the beginning, but again not truly necessary

A digital signal processing class / fourier transformation class would help cuz I straight blanked for a few lectures as I didn't have the foundational knowledge \[but I still got a lot out of the course, mind you\]

If you have zero programming experience, that's fine, just make time to do a few tutorials when the time comes

Looking for female roommate(s) Fall 2020-Spring 2021!,7,dvkrbe,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/dvkrbe/looking_for_female_roommates_fall_2020spring_2021/,0,1573639920.0," Hi all!

I'm in need of roommates for next year! I am an organizational psychology major and a rising senior. I currently pay $500 for rent plus utilities, so I'm looking for a similar price range (or if you would like to move in with me here at Campus Oaks Apartments--in that case, I would need 3 female roommates).

Here are some basic things about me:

* I'm a little quiet at first, and I'm serious about my studies, so I would like roommates that aren't too noisy or constantly partying and bringing people over into our apartment! Do your own thing, I don't mind, just don't blast music at the ripe hour of 3 AM.
* I'm pretty easy to get along with, just shy; I won't get in your way, and we should get along just fine unless you're rude, overly messy, invade my own area (that includes stealing and looking through my things), and/or are in any way racist/homophobic/etc. The works. Just be a decent human being please! Don't pick your nose and stick it on the wall, don't stuff leftover food in your socks, y'know.
* I speak Spanish fluently, I am an intermediate Portuguese speaker, and can speak basic Korean, so if you speak any of those and you need help adapting or anything as an international student or something, I am of service!
* My interests include: the arts (drawing and music), the humanities and social sciences (I was going to be a literature major before I decided on psych), grad school, etc... all in all, I think I would fit well with open-minded and compassionate roommates!

I'm not sure what else to say. If you would like to know more about me, or you're interested in rooming with me, please shoot me a DM and we'll work something out!",7

I met with her in the spring to register for this semester's classes, she left a (3 credit hour) required class off and didn't tell me until 2 weeks before school started, screwing up my entire schedule and blaming me for the error.

The University of Illinois is last in the Big Ten at 'Twitter Followers Rate',7,dvgsvw,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/dvgsvw/the_university_of_illinois_is_last_in_the_big_ten/,13,1573623184.0,"Mid-30s here. I grew up in the Chicago suburbs. Small school alum. I grew up the child of parents who graduated from another Big Ten school. All my neighbors cheered for various universities (something quite opposite of what I saw when visiting relatives in Indiana). Compared to my teenage years, I now have a much greater appreciation of what a remarkably outstanding university that UIUC is.

And yet .... (dramatic pause) .....

a belief that still holds from my high school years is this: compared to other Big Ten schools, people aren't particularly excited about being University of Illinois students.

The huge football win on Saturday got me thinking about school spirit at the University of Illinois. I was surprised how few comments there were on a popular Illini blog. And I remembered a friend recently saying that there are seemingly way more Chicago bars for other Big Ten schools compared to the number of bars for the Illini.

A post on this subreddit a year ago, ""Lack of school spirit"", raised a similar question. The OP mentioned, "" When I visited my friends at other big 10 schools, they had dedicated traditions and an overall feeling of cohesion that you just dont experience at UIUC. From my experience, people here view UIUC as not something particularly special or even a place they are really proud of attending. "" As someone else noted, "" I was at U of I in 2011 when we were 6-0, and Block I STILL wasn't even close to full. Compare that to any other big ten school that's student section is literally packed to the walls every game.""

I think that there are a few reasons that school spirit might be lower at Illinois compared to other schools:

* More than any other Midwest city, Chicago draws a much higher number of out-of-state transplants. Chicago gets alums from Purdue / Iowa / Indiana / Michigan / Michigan State / Wisconsin in a way that no other city does. A relatively large proportion of future University of Illinois students grow up in households cheering for other universities, and then before they know it, they find themselves as University of Illinois students. They might cheer for the Illini while at school, but probably not with the same intensity as someone who grew up in greater Detroit (UM/MSU) or Columbus (OSU) or Indy (PU/IU) or Minneapolis (UMn) or Omaha (UN).
* Illinois (60%) has a higher acceptance rate than Northwestern (10%), Notre Dame (18%), Michigan (28%), Minnesota (44%), Wisconsin (52%), Ohio State (54%), or Purdue (56%). Is there a significant amount of Illinois students that wish that they were at another university?
* Apart from Penn State (home to arguably the most famous football coach in college football history, and one of the most famous stadiums), no Big Ten U is located further from its state's biggest city than UIUC is from Chicago. This distance greatly disincentives traveling back to the university to attend sporting events or activities.

I wanted to get some numbers around school spirit. One way to do it is to see how likely its alumni are to follow the school's official Twitter account. Using alumni figures from LinkedIn and follower counts on the Twitter account, I came up with a percentage which shows the ratio between the number of followers of the school's official Twitter account divided by the number of alumni of that school. I'm aware that non-alumni can of course follow a school's Twitter account, but this is the best sentiment that I could come up with for the time being. From my quick glance, I didn't find 'social media strategy' to be a meaningful factor. The U of I account has plenty of interesting tweets per day.

Ohio State, with 331k Twitter followers at 313k alumni (per LinkedIn), led the list at 106%.

Illinois, 80k Twitter followers and 307k alumni (per LinkedIn) was last in 'follower rate' among the fourteen schools of the Big Ten, at a measly 26%.

So what are your thoughts? Why do you think that Illinois is last on this list? Why, even in good times for football, is the student section much less crowded than it is at other schools? Is there anything that U of I can do to make its students love its school more?

- Start your car regularly! If you drive infrequently (less than once a week), it’s a good idea to at least start your vehicle and let it run for 5-10 minutes so that the battery stays fresh.  Otherwise that one time you do need your car, it’s likely going to be dead. Try to start it maybe once a week. 

- Keep gas in the tank !  Less of a problem with cars now but a good habit to practice nonetheless. Don’t keep your car on E when it’s below freezing. Low fuel means higher likelihood of air being in a fuel line, and cold air can crack fuel lines.  Like I said not as much of a problem with new car designs but try to keep above a quarter tank regardless. 

- Keep emergency supplies in the car!  A blanket, hat gloves car charger etc. An innocent enough incident where you get stuck in the ditch can go from unfortunate to dangerous when your phones dead or it’s one of our famous -20 something days with no heat. 

These are some things that most of us who have lived in IL have heard since we’ve been driving, but please feel free to add more to the post.",79

I'm signed up for social psych research methods but was wondering do i need to take a class to stand a better chance at getting a research opportunity? There was another class in its place I wanted to take and that class doesn't come around very often.

Also, for the bio/cog requirement, I'm signed up for PSYC 230 but know 204 and 224 are better regarded and offered in the fall. Do you think it'd be okay to wait until and replace 230 with something else or should I stick it out? 

Appreciate any insight and advice that's offered.",1

Plow drivers will probably be working twelve hour shifts with no breaks to keep everything clear!

If you *have* to go out, turn your headlights on (such a basic step but I've seen very few with them on), drive very slow, and make sure you clean your car off with whatever you have available! Because it rained and then froze, there's a layer of ice under the snow, so brush up on how to manage that. Don't slam on the brakes, 'cause you'll skid; let off the accelerator first (don't mash your gas pedal either, your tires will just spin). Keep about three times more distance between yourself and the car ahead as you normally would, especially because a lot of drivers aren't sure how to handle this weather. This will also help you avoid braking.

Heuristics for midterm 2 of the algorithms course,16,dv0m22,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/dv0m22/heuristics_for_midterm_2_of_the_algorithms_course/,3,1573542105.0,"I feel that these are the things jeff wants to test on the midterm. Also, feel free to ignore because I'm not a TA - this post is thanks to a friend who indirectly motivated me to make it. 

Once you've identified the broad category under which the question falls, doing these things might help.

Dynamic programming - 

Start by thinking of a recurrence relation. For building the recurrence relation, try thinking in terms of a function (say T), and a set of variables (say x,y) that describe every state in the computation you're trying to build. 

Once you are able to do this, it may be obvious that the computation involves computing the same thing over and over. If not, try drawing a recurrence tree of the function T. This is where you say ""let me build a data structure to store the value of T(x,y)"". This will most likely be a 2-dimensional array but could just be a simple array.

Graphs - 

Start by reading the last line. If something is to be minimized, then you're looking at a shortest paths problem. If something is to be maximized, then you're looking at the longest path in a topologically sorted DAG. In any case, you're looking to solve a WELL DEFINED PROBLEM using a WELL DEFINED ALGORITHM on a NOT WELL DEFINED GRAPH.

Remember, the midterm will most likely expect you to convert the graph and then run an algorithm on it as a black box. In my opinion, it's likely to be a conversion based on running the SCC algorithm (Kosaraju), and this conversion occurs based on the property that once you're in one of the vertices of the SCC, you don't care how you get to the others because you can get there. 

But if it isn't that, try thinking about all the different states a vertex can have, and try using some kind of a set construction method like a cartesian product or something to make the vertices and edges. Again, this is just my opinion but ABSOLUTELY DO NOT MESS WITH THE ALGORITHMS IN THE BOOK. JUST USE THEM AS IS. But do try messing with the graph. Try figuring out a way to make the graph so that you can just say - ""...and use \*ALGORITHM\* to solve \*PROBLEM\*"". This is the skill they want to test.

\----

If you have no idea how to solve the problem by the end, REMEMBER TO SAY I DON'T KNOW IN NICE BOLD LETTERS and remember, this midterm has little to no consequence on your life as a whole. Jeff himself had an undergrad GPA of 2.4- it's more important to have a bunch of takeaways from the midterm.",16
