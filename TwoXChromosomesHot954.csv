My brand new 'escape fund'!,710,dq94dh,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dq94dh/my_brand_new_escape_fund/,50,1572665624.0,"I (25F) wanted to share a conversation that I had with my partner (25M) yesterday about getting away from abusive relationships, and how important it is that we always have access to some of our own money. For some context: After I finished university, I moved to abroad to the country where I currently live. My parents still live in the country where I was born. The country where I now live is where I met my partner as well. We have been together for a few years, and are getting married next year.

What brought me to this conversation: There are posts on here regularly about strong and brave people leaving their abusive relationships. I have always thought of myself as a strong woman who wouldn't take shit from anyone and who would leave in a heartbeat if I felt that I was being mistreated, but I've been thinking a lot recently about how my life has never been more intertwined with someone else's than it now is with my partner. This is obviously voluntary; I love this man with all my heart, and I am positive that he is the person that I want to spend my life with. But it is making me a bit nervous as well. There are a few things that I have been thinking about that would make it a lot harder for me to leave that I always thought I was. Most of these are wholesome reasons: I absolutely love the life that we have built together for ourselves. We have wonderful friends here, and I love his family like they are my own; I would be devastated to have to leave them behind. 

Slightly less wholesome reasons for not being as able to leave now is that we live 30 minutes away from his family, but a plane journey away from mine -- he definitely has the stronger support system in his area. He also makes quite a lot of money, and while I have a full-time job, I make peanuts compared to what he makes and there is no way I could afford to live in our house by myself.  He is also the registered keeper on both of our cars -- one he already had before we met, and one we bought together. We are now paying for our upcoming wedding together, and I have always had my own savings but have been using these to pay for parts of the wedding.

Yesterday, I confided in him that as much as I love him and trust him, it makes me nervous that it is becoming harder and harder for me to walk away from our life together if I needed to for whatever reason. I am very acutely aware of the fact that if anything were to happen -- if he were to become abusive, or even just break up with me -- I would be far away from my family, and not easily able to afford my own house, especially now that most of our savings are going towards the wedding. I told him that I am very aware of how tangled our lives are now, and how I am scared that I do not have the means to just up and leave if he were ever showing abusive tendencies. I started crying at this point because I felt really guilty about even having these thoughts about him ever being an abuser. He is the kindest, most considerate person I have ever met, and part of me was worried I would hurt him by saying all of this stuff. Well, I couldn't have been more wrong.

My partner gave me the biggest hug, and then said ""Well, then let's get you an 'escape fund'. If this is what it takes for you to never have to feel worried about this, we will sit down together and talk about how much money you think you'd need to your name in order to leave if you ever felt that you needed to. And we'll sign one of the cars over to you as well."" I asked him if he was sure, and if he wasn't mad that I was even having these ""what if"" thoughts about him. He smiled at me and said: ""My darling, I want you to stay with me because you want to be with me -- not because you feel trapped.""

Obviously I proceeded to bawl like a baby. We hugged it out, and then decided that we would sit down and have that conversation, and decide on an amount that BOTH of us would be able to keep in our individual 'escape funds', should we ever need to leave the other. This has cemented in me that I have done the right thing by committing to this person. He is kind and selfless, and has shown that he will never ask me to compromise my own safety for his own happiness. Lovely people of TwoXChromosomes, I truly hope that more of you have partners like this. If you do, don't take it for granted. Just wanted to share -- thank you for reading.

My love, on the off chance you end up finding this: you are kind, you are smart, you are important.

Tldr: I believe that everyone deserves the kindness and respect that my partner showed me last night by setting me up with my own 'escape fund'. If someone truly loves you, they will make sure that you can always put your own safety first, and not make you feel guilty about 'not trusting them'. Do not settle for less.",710
"I just need to be sad right now. My kid is permanently, unequivocally, forever battling a medical condition. And it sucks.",16351,dpzhm1,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dpzhm1/i_just_need_to_be_sad_right_now_my_kid_is/,1113,1572611455.0,"And I don't know where else to share this. It's 11pm on Halloween night. My friends, family, and husband are all fast asleep. I'm laying beside my 7 year old daughter, cradling her as she survives through the chaos that is Type 1 Diabetes. She's snoring, but in between bouts of snores, she whimpers. About an hour ago, she cried out ""Why is this me?!"" then was right back to sleep.



I cry. For the first time since her diagnosis, I really really cry. You know the kind. Snot dripping down your face, big awkward gulps of air. Wailing.



Thank goodness she's a heavy sleeper.



She was just diagnosed in August. It's been 3 months. Only 3 months? And today, she ate a few extras candies (literally like 3 candies at school). Her blood sugar levels were high. Then we went trick or treating, and they got low. So we treated them with 15g of simple sugars - candy. We sat on the walking trail by our house while she laid down in her Joan of Arc costume. We waited. She came back up. My husband was ancy because our son was getting tired.  So we pushed through. We got to our friend's and she could barely stand. I gave her a piggy back ride and she said, ""You're the best mom ever. Like really, ever."" 



She struggled the whole way home. I tried to give her a piggy back ride again, but I was tired. She ninja rolled under our neighbour's fence to take the shortcut home. I met her there. 



And all night, she's had a horrific headache. Her stomach hurts. And she's weepy. Everything is the worst. My amazing, strong, fucking brilliant little mini-me is now wailing in pain because her stupid fucking pancreas has decided to stop making insulin. Fuck you, pancreas. 



She asks me to read to her. I do. Normally, it's one book, then 10 minutes of cuddles. Today, it's as many books as she wants. She asks me to keep reading as she falls asleep. I read Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls, while admiring my own little rebel girl.



One who will now die if she doesn't have insulin. 



Everything changes so quickly. For the first time since her diagnosis, I long for the days when our biggest hurdle was her having temper tantrums and wetting the bed. 



Now she has a team of people who need to be her pancreas. 



She snores. She wails. She cries. Then, for the first time since her diagnosis, she throws up. 



Now, if you know anything about people with t1d, it's that they need carbs, along with insulin, to keep their numbers stable.



She just threw up all of her carbs. The carbs that keep her from having seizures, or falling into a coma.



Her numbers go lower.



I go to the kitchen to grab water, and by the time I'm back, she's fallen back asleep.



With as much love as forcefully possible, I manage to get her to eat a single bite of a banana. I have to wake her up to do so.



She throws up 20 minutes later. 
I give her a spoonful of honey. She manages to take it. For now. 



I call the ""pediatric endocrinologist"", because my child now has a fucking specialist doctor? And he says to keep the needles and syringes handy in case her numbers go low again. I start bawling as I try to give him my email address so he can send me explicit instructions on now to stick a needle into my kid. And now, I'm awake, checking her every hour. 



I have work in the morning. 



This is my life now. 



This is her life now.



I try to practice gratitude, but in this moment, it just sucks ass. She's one of the healthiest kids I've ever met. She eats cherry tomatoes as a snack. She loves avocados. She tries new things. She self reflects. She sleeps well. She is adaptable. She drinks water. We don't even keep juice in the house (at least, not until sugar became her medication, because what the fuck right?) She stands up for her friends at school. She does math for fun. She sings and imagines. She's honest. We're as close as a mom and daughter can be (in a healthy way).



So, I'm pretty sure that we're living in the twilight zone. Everything feels upside down.



I'm thankful that she has such a strong support network. But at this moment, I feel cripplingly alone. I feel like I need to remember this night, our first really hard night. Maybe it'll knock me out of my positivity and gratitude that seems to weird people out. Maybe it'll make me more cynical or resentful. 



But then I look at her, and my heart bursts with love. At least we're in this together, her and me. Because if anyone could fucking own this shit, it's her.



I'm pretty sure that she's my hero. 


I don't even really know what the point of sharing this is. To feel a little less alone, maybe.


I gotta go now. I gotta check to see if her blood sugars are stable. 



Thanks for listening.


Edit: Holy shit. I posted this around midnight my time, and was thankful if I had gotten a few words of encouragement and support. I did NOT expect to wake up this morning to so much solidarity. Thank you all, so so much. My daughter is an incredible person, and we keep our adaptability and enthusiasm as high as possible on most days. This is the darkest day I've ever had with it so far, I think because I had to have the specialized ""In Case of Emergency"" Glucagon needle ready. My usual response to people is, ""I'm just thankful that we live in the time and place that we're in"", and that if anyone is strong enough for this, it's my daughter. She's been relatively on target for the first 2.5 months, but the past couple of weeks have been wildly random, and it's been hard to understand why. We have it comparatively easy because she's incredibly healthy otherwise. She still has Halloween candy from last year! As a mother, I consciously focused on removing the shame and emotional attachment that my family history has to food (and body image, and self-care), and for the most part, my daughter has a great outlook on herself, her relationship with her body, and with how she takes care of it. It's made dealing with the diagnosis so much more manageable. She has an incredible support network, a great school, I have a great job, and we are all rallying around her. We are really fortunate. Thank you for letting me share my darkness with you all so that it didn't come out of me in her presence.

We try to see her t1d as ""you're not sick, it's just an extra thing you need to do to take care of yourself, like how we take showers and eat nutritious food and get good sleep. You can still do all the things, we just need to do these extra steps."" But last night was a ""yep, my kid is definitely sick beyond normal sick"" kind of night, and it slapped me in the face.


Many of you have asked about CGMs and Pumps - our work benefits are finicky, and our doctors advised not to consider these tools for at least six months ""so we know how to handle things without them"". FWIW, we're in Canada. It's been three months, and I feel like a CGM would allow us to actually establish consistent patterns and make informed choices, so we decided to go ahead and apply for the insurance coverage. We're now just in the limbo of waiting for approval and then getting set up (with a Dexcom G6). It takes time, but we're pushing towards it. As for pumps, we hadn't even really considered one because she had been on target so frequently. But if I can prevent another night like this (while still giving her the space to just BE A KID), then I'm all for it. I will be looking into it today.

Again, thank you all for everything. The private messages, the awards (what do I do with these? Thank you for making my daughter's story more visible!), the comments, the practical advice; even the insensitive comments are appreciated - it comes with the territory of putting yourself out there, and it's worth it. Thank you all for sharing your stories of living with t1d, or being a support of someone with t1d. It means so much to me. Our family stands on the shoulders of giants who have found solutions to the problems so that we can adapt easier. I will do my best to get back to everyone that I can, but even if I don't, know that I read every single message and have been crying like a baby. But this time there's a little less weight on my shoulders when I do it. Thank you, thank you, thank you.",16351

I haven't told anyone that I'm breaking up with my boyfriend and moving to another state.,188,dq5dl9,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dq5dl9/i_havent_told_anyone_that_im_breaking_up_with_my/,58,1572649207.0,"I have been living with my boyfriend of 3 years and I have been so unhappy for so long. All of my friends are his friends, and I have no one to tell. I felt so trapped and financially dependent on him, I care so much about him, but I cant stay with him. I have been saving for while. I have enough to move out, and I cant spend another holiday feeling this way. 

Its gut wrenching to think about, and I have been keeping this secret from everyone i know. I am thrilled to move and start over, I'd be leaving nothing behind since I only have my boyfriend, but it's such a big move. I haven't done it sooner because it's so out of my comfort zone, but I need this.

I feel so much guilt to have to leave him, but I need this for myself. I needed to tell someone, even if this gets no attention, I needed to put it into words. 

Thank you.

Edit:  Thank you all so much for your words of encouragement!!!  This decision was very hard for me to make and it gives me confidence knowing I'm not the only one who has experienced this. 

To clarify, I am telling him that I am leaving with due time. I am not just taking off and taking what is mine and not telling him. He is understanding and I know I could talk to him and tell him I'm moving out, I just dont need to complicate things by telling him too much too early. I want to make this easy on him and its why I'm trying to leave before the holidays too. Trust me, I really do not enjoy feeling like I am putting him through this, but I cant be with him any longer and I feel it's even more unfair to continue this relationship if I feel this way. I know he will understand.",188
My gf told me she was raped and i'm lost,34,dq8v61,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dq8v61/my_gf_told_me_she_was_raped_and_im_lost/,23,1572664518.0,"So... We're on a long distance relationship (+20h flight). We met long ago (4y)  and we've been friends since then but we both had a partner until 1y-2y ago. We started dating 6 months ago. We like to travel a lot and we never lived in the same city so we meet up here and there, and have been like this for 3 months. We never stayed together at the same country (as a couple) more than a week so it have been quite hard for us. We text and facetime every day since the beggining.
She went to finish her studies to the opposite side of the world and will be there until next year and then she is suposed to move with me.

I'm absolutly in love with her and i'm sure she feels the same way and she proved it to me several times so i have never been insecure about it.

Well... It was her birthday two days ago and she throw a party on a restaurant at night.

She said he drank too much and when the party was over she took a taxi with a male friend that lives on the same building and that was supposed to be the end of the night 

The next day i called her to ask how was the party (we have 6h diff of time zone so i was sleeping) and she was pretty quiet, said ""was okay"" and i was unable to get anything else but i thought she was just tired.

That same day, at night she text me that we have to talk about a serious thing so i call her, and then...
She says she woke up remembering nothing but some flashback's. She felt pain down there and felt like shit and she was dressed but without her underwear. Then she texted the guy and he says that they had sex because he thought she wanted even in she was wasted as hell and knew she was in a relationship. Then the fucker apologizes and tries to end the conv like ""well we're both guilty but its ok"".

I don't event know what to think, I fully trust my gf and she has no reason to tell me that if it was consensual. She feels like absolutely shit and has been crying the whole day. Obviously I'm enraged as fuck but I'm fully conscious that this is not about me at all and i tried to not be aggressive about the situation so she doesn't feel hostility from me.
Also she says she feel guilty for drunking too much and says she has part of the responsibility, to witch i answer that she is fully the victim and that (even if is not the healthiest thing);any person should be free to go freaking waste drunk without being sexually assaulted and she doesn't has to be ashamed for it.

Now, i told her she should file charges but she seems insecure about it because she's in a foreign country, she feels ashamed about all and not sure if it's worth. 
Obviously i said is her choice but even if i don't want to force it to her i really feel like it's the right thing to do.
She just told her female flatmate about it and she was pretty supportive and told her that she could go with her to file charges, so at least i don't feel she's alone.
Reality is i can't just travel there right now and i feel pretty worthless and a bit lost about it. I made clear i support her 100%, and that she shouldn't feel guilty or ashamed in any way, but I'm not really sure how to handle it from here.

She's obv pretty down and i don't feel like talking about minor things or try to making her laugh or whatever. I'm just... There.. listening to whatever she has to say and but the silences makes me feel that i should be saying or doing something that i have no idea of what is is. 
She even said she doesn't want to do videosex (with subtle words) until she feels better witch i thought it was absolutely obvious, i mean there was no way I'm starting it or expecting it, and i feel devastated that she even has the consideration to tell me that, like i know she has been on some really toxic relationships but what kind of motherfucker would ask for that on those moments.

I don't know, right know half of me wants to hug her really bad like forever, the other half wants to destroy that guy into pieces and i don't mean it like an edgy thing, I'm just full rage and sadness, but i don't want her to feel negativity from me so I try to be calm and rational, show her unconditional love and... I don't really know what else to do.

Sorry for the shitty format, I'm on mobile and a bit shaky.",34
Man up at the thrift shop,22,dqajlj,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dqajlj/man_up_at_the_thrift_shop/,8,1572671776.0,"Earlier today, I (male) bought a desk from a local thrift shop. I pulled around back to pick up the desk and two women were there willing to get it from the floor and help load it into the car. While they went to go get it, I readjusted my car seats and such to try and make space. It was a large office desk with a filing cabinet on one side and legs on the other. It wasn't incredibly heavy but definitely heavy/cumbersome for one to try and carry.  


When the women got back to the car with the desk, I tried to help by grabbing the filing cabinet side. (From a year or two of working at Goodwill, I always preferred that the vehicle's owner determine how it was going into the car and gauge how much force to apply - so that's why I took over one side). But now one of the workers is off to the side as another car pulls up (perhaps having made a donation to another thrift shop). He calls out to see if we need help. I don't know if anyone responded to him as my back was turned. We literally just started when he pulled up and then the driver got out and said something to the affect, ""Let's have two men lift it."" He attempted to get my opposite end where the other worker was but she kept her place (good for her) and at that point, we kind of told him that we had it covered and he got back in his car and drove off.  


It was extremely awkward while he was there but I appreciate the workers' professionalism in the matter. The stranger probably meant well, but he clearly overlooked the fact that these two women work here and this is what they signed up to do. Let them do their job. Anyways, if you two see this - thanks again and I'm sorry for the awkwardness. And guys who see this - let's just remember that women are capable and we don't have to be the ""white knight"" for them.",22
Reported two colleagues for taking a photo of me,50,dq77l6,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dq77l6/reported_two_colleagues_for_taking_a_photo_of_me/,18,1572657173.0,"A few days ago, I anonymously reported two colleagues. Today HR followed up and I confessed to being the reporter. I couldn't figure out another way to provide them with the info they need while staying anonymous, so I took the leap of faith. 

This was by all means extremely mild in the scale of possible harassments, but I still felt the need to report so that there are no other incidents for other women. 

What had happened was that Colleague A and Colleague B came into office (this was my first and only time meeting them in person, as they're usually remote). At the end of a meeting, colleague A took a picture of me, as in, he leaned in, pointed the camera at just me, then took a picture. Colleague B laughed and called him a pervert, then asked ""what are you going to do with that?""

I was uncomfortable at that point and shrugged it off for the sake of moving on and finishing up the meeting asap. It wasn't until later that night that I realized it really wasn't professional behavior. I reported the next day through my company's anonymous hotline. 

Fast forward to today, when I retold the incident with HR. No further action needed, but I just wanted to get this off my chest. Who knows what will happen from here on out. I sincerely hope this corrects Colleagues A&B's behaviors for all women moving forward. Thanks for reading.",50

The bus was pulling in and everyone was lining up. A guy who I believe was drunk came up behind me and slid his hand down my back and almost to my ass. It made my skin crawl, and I jerked away from him. I'm usually pretty timid/ nervous, and I've been sexually assaulted 6 times (all during my high school years, 3 times from the same person) and raped when I was 24. But lately, I've been working on my backbone and saying no instead of trying to alleviate other people's feelings. Been going to therapy, learning and accepting that it's not my fault that people have done absolutely shitty things to me, and how to protect my boundaries in the future. 

Especially now that I have a small dog, I've noticed more and more people are perfectly fine getting into my personal space without my consent and I'm just not cool with that. 

I looked back at him and said very clearly, 

""Don't touch me.""

He had scoffed at me, and said, loudly and incredulously ""Don't touch you?!"" This really hit a nerve, I've already established my boundary and he just dismisses it like I'm some overreacting child. So I looked him square in the eye, and said ""Yes, don't *fucking* touch me."" in the loudest voice I could muster. He froze and stared at me for a moment, and before he could say anything else a guy at the front of the line to get on the bus called me over and said ""Here ma'am, get on the bus, he's a drunk asshole."" I nodded and jumped the line, and as he  got on behind me I heard him tell the bus driver ""Hey, don't let that guy on. He inappropriately touched that woman and isn't listening to her No."" 

It just felt so relieving to have someone on my side. Normally in large crowds like that, I've noticed people are just too nervous to help or say something, so I really appreciated it.

(When I got home my partner gave me a big hug, which helped alleviate my skin crawling)

So I opened the window, said “go piss off somewhere else” and slammed it again. I figured it was just some drunk college kids who’d wandered off from a nearby Halloween party and they’d probably just go stumble off to some other semi-secluded spot. 

I hear them shouting and running so I go to the front room to try and see where they’re going. They came to the front door and tried to get in, rattling the doorknob and putting their weight against the door. Luckily it was locked, and one of my roommates heard the commotion. He came out and stood with me while until the drunk party boys left. He made me tea while I tried to calm down. Eventually my other roommate came out (he’d been showering while this went down) and offered to sleep in the front room if it would make me feel safer. 

I usually don’t confront people and this sort of aggressive response really scared me. Being shouted at or flipped off I expected, but them trying to break into my apartment is a completely different level of scary.

I wanted to share my story, partly to raise awareness and partly to help me deal with my own issues. I’ve been over weight almost all my life, since about 9-10 years old. I deal with a lot of issues of self hatred/shame when it comes to my body. Also, since I was an infant throughout my childhood, I dealt with a lot of medical issues which also made me pretty fearful of doctors. I hit puberty right in time, at 12 yo, but never developed a “normal” cycle. My fear and shame led me to never address this with a doctor. I rarely saw any sort of medical professional from the ages of 16-39, no gyno, no family practice docs. Over time my periods became more irregular. I went from long stretches of time to bleeding constantly. I always brushed this aside as a side effect of my weight, or maybe PCOS or fibroids and just dealt with it. I never had pain/cramps. Over the past year it just got worse and worse. I was anemic, constantly tired. Some days I barely wanted to move. One Saturday in June I woke up one day bleeding so profusely that I almost passed out. I ended up in the ER twice that weekend. I had no choice at this point to address the issue. I had a few appointments and a d&c done and discovered what I pretty much knew at that point. It was uterine cancer. The tumor at this point had encroached over 50% of my uterus. I had a radical hysterectomy and just finished radiation treatment last Friday.  During surgery they had to give me 2 units of blood because my blood counts were so low. I also ended up with a surprise appendectomy because my appendix apparently was about to burst and I didn’t even know it. I share my story to 1. Encourage you all to listen to your bodies and don’t let fear stop you from seeking help. Don’t let things go. And 2. I am trying to be more open and not let the shame control me.

"A terrible OB/GYN did a painful Pap smear without telling me, and I’m pretty shaken up.",5,dqa95y,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dqa95y/a_terrible_obgyn_did_a_painful_pap_smear_without/,7,1572670515.0,"I moved to a new city recently, and my husband and I have just started trying to conceive. I have a history of mild endometriosis, and a previous very traumatic loss (though that pregnancy was unplanned), so my fertility is a little bit of a question mark, so it sounds like I shouldn’t have too much trouble. I was referred to a OB/GYN, went into that appointment nervous but full of hope, and she turned out to be the worst doctor I’ve ever seen. 

She brushed off my concerns, but I figured it was good news that she didn’t expect me to have future fertility issues. However, things started to go bad when she basically demanded I go off a medication I’ve been on for seven years. Without this particular med (Lyrica), I have severe nerve pain and I’m not functional. She didn’t give me any plan, alternatives, or discussion of the actual risks, just told me I needed to go off it. I later read that while in small studies it slightly increased the risk of birth defects, the risk remains small and the defects don’t follow any particular pattern. Plus...I need to have some quality of life. Judging from the three “Breast is Best” posters in her office, she’d probably push me to stay off it to breastfeed. My kid needs a mom who’s actually there for them. I would much rather formula feed and not be in horrific pain, but I know that wouldn’t jive with this OB. 

The worst part was the exam though. Since I told her I had a normal Pap smear in my hometown under a year ago, when she told me to lie down for the exam, I figured it would just be a quick bimanual exam. And it started out that way. But she didn’t tell me a damn thing while she was doing the exam. I started to feel a pretty uncomfortable sensation which I figured was a speculum. I said “ow” a few times, but she didn’t respond. Then I started to feel actual bad pain. I kept saying “ow, that hurts” and I think I sounded pretty terrified. Which I was, because I was in pain with very little clue as to what was going on. She didn’t stop or act any gentler, just told me she was almost done. Finally, after what was likely only a couple of minutes but felt way too long, it was over. Once she was done, she told me she did a Pap and cultures which was standard procedure. I would have had no issues consenting to this beforehand, but I had no idea what was happening while it was happening. My old doctor always told me what she was doing step by step and tried to minimize any discomfort. Not this doctor. She just didn’t care. I was shaky and dazed and felt like I was going to throw up. She headed out the door saying to come back whenever I get pregnant, or if I haven’t conceived in a year. I’m not going to do that. I’m going to find a new doctor because she was the worst one I’ve eve seen. 

I left a voicemail for the hospital’s patient relations department, but I wonder if I’m overreacting. I have anxiety around medical stuff from dealing with chronic illness and invasive procedures as a kid, so maybe I had a bigger reaction than others would. That being said, it was kind of a terrifying experience. I don’t want to misuse this word but it felt kind of violating too. It was three days ago but I’m a bit shaky as I type this out actually.

Up ahead, I saw a man screaming at someone - at first, I couldn't see who was the source of his wrath. But it was the type of screaming you notice. Vitriolic, intense, vein popping screams. 

He got in a car, and I thought he was leaving (kinda relieved) then he reversed the car and stormed around the corner after a woman. 

She looked afraid. She sat on the grass, and he stood over her and just spewed hate at her. Standing over her, screaming.  

There was no way I could walk away and ignore this, so I called police. But what I found heartening was several people stopped. Men and women. Several people stopped, called police, stood by in case things escalated further. 

It took ages for police to arrive (seriously...like 40 minutes. So disappointing that just because we reported the threat of violence rather than actual violence it took them so long) but 4 of us waited and reported him, provided our information, and stood witness for this woman. Many others stopped to see if we needed more support. 

On the one hand - the life this woman must have with him breaks my heart. On the other - that people stopped, made it their business, and made sure she was safe (at least for now) shows me that maybe there is a change in attitude around domestic violence. 

I hope she's safe tonight. And knows that people do care.",60

This is going to sound shallow, I know, but clothes aren’t fitting like they used to and I’m having a hard time adjusting. I started strength training about 7 weeks ago, and despite how much I complain to my trainer I really am enjoying it (especially deadlifting!) my goals were to get stronger to improve my soccer skills...I’m not sure if it’s helping with the latter, but it may be too early to really tell.

Anyways I’ve been relatively trim all my life...I have a bit of an issue with my lower belly, which I can never seem to get flat, but overall I’ve been the same size since high school and can wear the same clothes...at least until now (I’m 27 for reference).

Pants/shorts don’t fit me anymore...I feel like they’re going to bust at the waist. It’d be one thing if just my butt was getting bigger, but it’s like I’m getting thicker in the middle and it’s hard to deal with. I know if I told anyone I feel fat they would roll their eyes, but damnit that’s how I feel. I cant say it to my trainer, he’s not my therapist. I cant say it to any coworkers cause that’s not appropriate for the workplace. And I don’t want to say it to my boyfriend because I don’t want to seem insecure. But I want to tell someone how I feel.

And no, i don’t think this is going to lead to an eating disorder or anything. I’ve tried to restrict when I was younger and I just couldn’t do it, I don’t see myself doing it now. I just don’t know how to cope :/",1

I even had one boy ask me out as a joke and call me racial slurs for hispanics. 

It doesn't matter how many people call me pretty. It feels like the few negative comments weigh on my mind so heavily that they drown out any positive comments. I hadn't been called ugly for years. However, this recent incident has caused me to become more depressed and insecure again. 

I was in my coworkers car & we drove to his friend's house so he could pick some stuff up. His friend came outside, opened my car door and said ""who's this then, a girl?"". He asked my name, and when I told him he replied ""Jodie, you're beautiful"". I said ""thank you"" and he slammed the car door shut and muttered ""just kidding"" under his breath.

Im pretty sure I have anxiety and it gets real bad, I have to panic about something all the time. IT JUST WONT STOP. At one point its grades then when all that is settled its about how I feel super ignored and I have to scream to get attention from people when asking basic questions or even giving information to people that ask for it. And when its not that its my irrational fear of pregnancy. Ive gotten Nexplanon in May and I know its working because my period cycles have been jacked up and then about a month and a half ago just stopped. Its nice, but now here is the panic. 

I have a bf and this pregnancy anxiety has started way before we even had sex. Anything that we did outside of sex at random moments in time would make me go ""am I pregnant????"" even if it was something like and I cannot make this up I gave him a handjob, washed my hands and then used the bathroom and then thought the sperm left on my hand went on the toilet paper and then somehow got in me and im pregnant.  The anxiety is bad, my mom has it too and she wont get help for it and tells me that panicking once in a while is ok....its not...its constant. She's not a doctor, but has a PHD un a completely unrelated field that has nothing to do with science and likes to read these med sites that I personally have not seen and find questionable. Shes not anti vax. So back to the whole sex am I pregnant thing. I know I not in a million years can be pregnant. Every site ive read, every medical study I found anyone who has ever gotten pregnant from Nexplanon either:

 A) was pregnant when they got it. 

B) Did not wait the 7 day grace don't have unprotected sex period. 

C) Were taking enzyme related medication which lowers the birth controls ability to work. 

D) never got it inserted or checked that it was in place by feeling their arm. 

E) Were overweight which some studies say that it has no effect on the BC

So here I am, on Nexplanon 99.95% effective typical and actual use. Using condoms each time, and pull out 100% success each time (bf cant really get off with sex sorry tmi) and ready for sex because even if im not a young adult and am in my 40's this will still probably be a problem for me. 

I cant talk to anyone about this not even my mom because of the whole sex ordeal, Im being safe and relying on myself to do what I can to be protected and have a good future. Once I can get out of the house im planning to get a therapist and get my anxiety checked out. I really don't give a shit if they put me on meds or make me do therapy I just want to stop being afraid and scared of everything I do. The panicking has gotten so bad that my boyfriend has even gotten me a pregnancy test even when he knew I was just overreacting and just wanted to support me. ive taken 3 all of which Im 99% sure were negative. I took one and then 4 weeks later thought I took it wrong and took another. Then after that my period after becoming lighter and lighter stopped and so I panicked, waited 3 week+ and took another just one line showing. clear as day no ghost lines.

For example did I let him have sex with me even of I did not want to, sometimes I even initiated it because I thought I had to. I don't recall him ever stopping because I was tense, or because I was quiet or anything. I don't even recall him asking me if I wanted to have sex. I did what I had to to make it finish faster and just tried to not cry openly afterwards

During this relationship I became suicidal and mostly slept

I do not consider him an active rapist, sure he is emotionally stunted but he isn't a bad person and I have no doubt that if I told him about this he would be upset about the situation so I have not had any good reason to tell him

It was my next partner 3 years later that flipped the table after he found out and said that ""that's rape!"" and went into a long monologue about consent and that if there isn't any consent it is rape

Every single time this comes up and I call it rape people gets upset with me. Saying it is my own fault, that I was tricking my ex to have sex with me, that I'm a slut and a really bad gf. When I say that I feel no aggression against my ex and that I'm not going to report him other people gets upset and calls me weak, part of the problem, traitor and that I'm worst then people that rape

I used to live in one of the biggest cities of the world, and I was taking my dog to the vet for his annual shots, he's small and was inside his dog carrier purse - because a carrier is mandatory when riding the subway.
In the 5 minute walk from the vet to the subway station, I was waiting at a crosswalk for its signal to turn green so I could cross the road. The road was busy, but I was alone at this spot, and at the opposite side of the crosswalk, a homeless man started coming towards me and between the honking cars, demanding I leave the spot because he wanted to walk through where I was standing. There was no one near me, but there were three male police officers at the opposite side of the crosswalk, where the homeless man initially was, and the officers did Nothing but watch the screaming man coming towards me and between the cars - he was crossing the road while the signal was red.
I was holding my dog and I panicked, I didn't know what to do, I was too scared to open my mouth to say something or even move. He was getting closer and I froze there. In the span of seconds, I watched the man come close enough to spit on me, someone on a car started yelling at him to leave me alone, I started crying, the signal turned green for me, I started running to other side, looked at the police officers in disgust, but then something magical happened: this lady was waiting for me to arrive at the sidewalk and she hugged me, asked if I was ok, asked me if I wanted her to call someone and walked me to the subway station so I wouldn't feel alone.
I got in the station desperately crying, and no one bothered to ask if I was ok. I felt and still feel so helpless, I ended up moving out of that city. I've seen many homeless people bother men and the police officers would come running, threatening the homeless people. I've seen subway security go out of their way to help men get in the train, holding doors and such. While us, women, always need to handle our stuff alone.

A Halloween Story,0,dq8gll,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dq8gll/a_halloween_story/,0,1572662743.0,"absolutely true events...

this morning, i awoke at 6am for work as always. like always in late fall, it's midnight black outside. i lean over to turn on my light, only it won't turn on. i jiggle the cord, try again, nothing. i look up to my windows and see the street lamps on the sidewalk are off.  i get up, walk through my living room and kitchen, none of the appliances are on. grabbing my phone, i turn on the flashlight and find my front door. looking out into the hall, it's pitch black with only the glowing red EXIT signs for light. 

in looking for a flashlight i can use to walk my dog in the dark, i hear a faint click, and my stove's clock starts blinking a dull LED blue. then...the fire alarm sounds, blaring so loud it stings my ears. my dog is terrified. i tug her from under the bed, throw on a coat and shoes and clip her leash on and we bolt out of the apartment. while the power appears to be partially restored, the hall lights are still off, so all we have to go on is the EXIT markers.  we run down the hall, turn to the nearest EXIT and down the stairs. i did not take the time to find my glasses, so i can't see very well. 

The security lights are functional in the stair well.  we follow the stairs to the nearest door to the outside and leave the building. and my dog immediately must poop.  fear does that to you. we've come out in a parking lot at the back of our building that is technically for the apartments next door which are not dog friendly and, just like our own building, is private property. it does not have more than a single street light in the corner.  it is still dark, and i still cannot see. 

i pick up after my dog, we're about 20 feet from the building, while the alarm is still loudly blaring from inside. once we've cleaned up, we start quickly heading out of the parking lot and to public sidewalk. i am aware we're not supposed to be there, but here we are. as i'm walking through this dark and rainy parking lot, i hear someone else. i look behind me thinking it was another exiled neighbor, but it was a random man, long umbrella in hand. and he's following me, commanding me to stop. i do not, as i am alone, it is dark, and i cannot see clearly. 

he keeps following me, i keep walking until i reach the light from the solitary lantern in the lot so i can at least see as well as i am able. he keeps yelling at me to stop and, when close enough, starts tearing into me. ""This is private property! you're trespassing! you can't be here and neither can your dog!""

the alarm is still blaring. this is the kind of alarm you can hear on the entire hill on which these buildings sit upon. now that i know this is just a nosy neighbor from the other building, i point to my apartment building behind me and say ""that building is evacuating. it is 6am. i have no glasses, and can't even tell which door i came out of. you hear the alarm in there?"" 

""uh...yes, i...i hear it now.""

i walk away absolutely livid, and climb my way up the hill in 54 mph winds to the front side of my building as fire truck sirens start to sound in the distance. i arrive with the rest of my neighbors and as we wait, i realize...

i didn't put in a tampon before i left the apartment, and do not sleep with underwear.  fuck. 

moral of the story: if you're that much of a busy body that you need to terrify a woman alone in the dark who clearly just evacuated a building, please go ahead and report me to the police or your property management company. i'm sure they would love to hear your justifications for being such stalker-ish busy body. also, always store extra tampons in your car.

I don’t remember what all we were tasting. We were just learning about different flavors and the debunked idea that different flavors could only be tasted on certain parts of your tongue.  One of those things kids do.

Anyway, while we were all sitting at our tables tasting the different things and generally having a good time, our troop leader came around with a glass of something and asked if we wanted to taste it. She wouldn’t tell us what it was, and my friends opted out. I have always been an adventurous eater so I said I taste it. She gave me a spoonful of whatever it was.  It wasn’t bad. It was sweet. And then she told us all it was actually her breast milk.

WTF?  My parents didn’t believe me: all milk comes from breasts. I’m sure it wasn’t her own breastmilk. But it was.  She had a new baby, and it was breastmilk. That’s what she told us. I wasn’t stupid. I didn’t misunderstand. Everybody laughed at me for trying it, but I’m more angry that this woman basically put her bodily fluids inside of my body without my consent.  At the time I was just grossed out, But now that I know about pathogens that are in breastmilk and just the general feeling of being violated I’m still a little bit pissed about that.

He kept saying no and that he didn't want to be a guinea pig, but I only meant it playfully. 

When he was standing in front of his desk I put him in a choke from behind, it wasn't super hard or anything, but he didn't tap either so I kept it on because I thought he'd let me know when to let go. After a moment I kind of felt him go a limp, and that point I panicked and quickly let go, but on the way down he hit his head on the edge of the table. When he came to he was panicking and told me to leave, and was crying. 

I understand that I should have asked first but at the same time I feel like he should have let me know that it was hurting him. I want to clear my conscience before I talk to him",0

I thought that it was just a very bad yeast infection that had developed into a rash, but the medication that the gyno gave me wasnt working, and I was fearing that it would be this.

I'm 17, I've been dating my boyfriend for over a year (hes 19). He was there when I got the phone call, so he knows. He comforted me and said hes not going to leave me and that I'm not gross (because I kept saying ""I feel so gross, you probably think I'm so gross, please dont leave me""), and that we are together no matter what, through thick and thin.

HSV1 isnt the type of herpes that's commonly known as ""genital herpes"", that would be HSV2, and the gyno explained that it could have come from anything, touching, kissing, cold sores, even that I've had it dormant in me and its just showing up now. I know my boyfriend isnt cheating on me, he doesnt have anything on his penis or balls. 

My parents dont know, they asked how the results were and I said that everything came back fine and negative, and I'm keeping it this way, I'm not going to tell anyone else except for my best friend of 11 years. 

I know that my boyfriend said that we're still okay and he loves me and isnt going to leave me, but I just feel gross, I know that this is common so I shouldnt feel this way, but I just dont know what to do or how to live with this, how to have sex or keep my boyfriend from getting it, I know that when an outbreak isnt happening that its very unlikely for me to give it to him, and the gyno has prescribed a medicine for me to take that will help reduce the symptoms of the outbreaks, and possibly shorten the amount of time they last. I have a lot of emotional stress at the moment, I just realized recently that my ex boyfriend wasnt just creepy or that it wasnt just me feeling gross about the things he did to me, but that it was actually sexual assault and sexual coercion, my mom and stepdad have been very mean and are very narcissistic and I'm ready to move in with my dad, and now i just got diagnosed with herpes. I'm going to therapy this week on thursday that has been set up by my counselor at school, originally for the assault by my ex but now i guess I'll bring the other 2 stresses up too.

Anywho, if anyone who also has been diagnosed with herpes has any advice, I would really be thankful to hear it.",0

Usually its a teary smile, but I full. On. BAWLED) oddly no cramps, which usually happens within the week leading up to my period.
Obviously the answer is PMS, but it has never ever been this bad, and I'm wondering if it's going to keep going like this further down the road? Like, will my next time-leading-up-to period start with all this as severe as it is? Or is it one of those once in a blue moon peak level of hormone bullshittery?

Since she was above 35 she was in preg rest for most of it. She gave birth to a healthy baby. 

When the baby was a few weeks old, the relationship fell apart. He demanded she leaves the house without the baby. He had people patrol the house so she was locked in unless she does so. Friends, most of them in their 30s(one couple in their early 40s) arranged an entire smuggling operation to get her stuff out of his house and finally her and the baby. 

What followed was very ugly, very vocal and overtook another, even younger than me, who's significantly younger than her, mutual friend's life completely. 

He sic'd a lawyer at them. Demanded full custody, tried to court-order her to move within 30kms away from him and out of his childhood home to have easy access to HIS child, paternity tests(yes, really), an ugly custody battle still happening today with the child in kindergarten.

My lesson? 

Be VERY careful who you're with. Make sure they have NO leverage over you or your access to resulting children. Stay away from the upper-class and networked. Status is a red flag. Not a bullet point. And be wary if your man gains status while you're in a relationship: I was smuggled out of a relationship months after she was except in my case it was a clean cut as we had no kids.",4

It might be mild to most but I figured I’d rant. I’m on mobile so bare with me. I don’t go out much and when I do it’s usually for groceries or for vacation. Well I was recently out to visit family and to celebrate my partners birthday. Thought the best way to do that was to go to their favorite amusement park and enjoy the food, Halloween festivities, and rides. 

The park does a Halloween themed thing where during the night they start haunted houses in certain areas of the park. So here we are going through them and enjoying ourselves, it’s dark at this point. We just finished up one of the haunted houses and headed out to meet up with my family. I was texting them to ask where to meet up and my eyes are glued to my phone for a few minutes as I walk next to my partner but not close. We are kind of separated from other people around us in a long walk towards more light and the rides. Most haunted houses are towards the back of each park for room. 

That’s when I hear a faint “hey” behind me. I didn’t think anything of it at first, I assumed it was for someone else as it’s a park and friends meet up and etc. I then proceeded to hear it again except with more intent “HEYY”. I look and out the corner of my eye there’s this guy and he is full on fast walking towards me. I have NO idea who the hell he is. I then thought maybe he thinks I’m someone he knows. But then he said something super creepy, “So you. What’s your name???” At that point I’m confused and like wtf cause he’s now jogging to see me in the dark and this dude is by himself with the intent to do I don’t know what. It was only him and us. There was a huge gap from other people. Red flags pop up in my head and my first reaction was to run. Before I could, my partner put their arm around me and pulled me close. Immediately this creep backed off and said “never mind” and then PRETENDED to act like he was trying to find directions. Once we found some more people and light, my partner stood there and watched the guy just to make sure we were both going different directions away from him. After that I kept my guard up and my partner was either holding my hand or close by my side. Didn’t have issues after that. 

I’ve experienced a lot in my life but I haven’t in so long and I’m really glad that my partner was there because I don’t know what would of happened if he wasn’t. I’m still a little freaked out. I still have questions in my head thinking like maybe he recognized me on Reddit? (My profile is nsfw). How long was he following me before he said something? I just felt uncomfortable and vulnerable when I should of been enjoying myself and my partners birthday. We had fun just towards the end was a bit creepy for both of us.

I went to the hospital and filed an initial report. That Saturday I spoke to a detective and gave a statement. I got the sense she stopped believing me when I said I was high. Tuesday she called me to tell me she's dropping the case due to ""lack of evidence to prove lack of consent"". I think that's bullshit so I'm emailing her because I refuse to lay there passively again while justice is being denied to me. I'd like some help with the wording so I can make sure she doesn't just give up. Here is what I have so far:

> Hi, Detective.   
>  
>Recently you investigated my sexual assault and called to tell me that you won't give it to prosecutors because ""there's not enough evidence to prove lack of consent"".   
>  
>I've been reading through statues and doing some thinking. You have it on record I was under the influence at the time of the assault, and the nurse collected a urine sample during the forensic exam that will show THC in my system. While the Arizona Revised Statutes do not explicitly define consent, it does state "" A. A person commits sexual assault by intentionally or knowingly engaging in sexual intercourse or oral sexual contact with any person without consent of such person."" (ars 13-1406).  And further states ""'Without consent' includes... (b) The victim is incapable of consent by reason of mental disorder, mental defect, drugs, alcohol, sleep or any other similar impairment of cognition and such condition is known or should have reasonably been known to the defendant. "" (ars 13-1401)  
>  
>You asked me what I did to indicate a lack of consent, and I was overwhelmed when answering your questions. The entire interview I was afraid I might get in trouble for smoking and driving. Returning to the building where I was originally examined brought a bunch of emotions back to the surface. I worry I may have left out important details because I was scared. Being in that building brought back all of the initial shame, fear, worry, and self-doubt. It made me feel the same way I did while he was penetrating me: helpless and alone. I worry I may have not emphasized things or spoke clearly about what happened. I want it to be clear what happened.  
I never consented to sex. In fact, I had turned him down multiple times.  Early in the night, I had mentioned that I had no sex drive because of my birth control and that I had ""the female version of ED"" and I joked that it would be ""blue balls for everyone tonight"". Later in the night, while we were in the car outside of Chandler Fashion Center, I asked him what he was trying to accomplish,  He responded, ""Honestly? I'm just trying to fuck."" to which I replied, ""Not tonight."" along with a list of excuses. You know the kind when you want to turn someone down without making things incredibly uncomfortable. When we were back at Brian's apartment Joseph tried to ask if we could cuddle but I didn't respond. I was kinda spaced out and didn't answer his question. I laid down because I was dizzy and he laid down behind me. I didn't respond because it was late and I was getting tired. I might've been still high; I don't know because I'm awful at telling when I'm high. The moment I could hear his belt coming off I froze. I didn't resist but I didn't reciprocate. I didn't move. I barely even breathed. I could've been asleep for all the reaction I had. He didn't say a thing to me before he forced down my leggings and violated my personal autonomy.   
Because of this, I have missed days at work. I still cannot sleep soundly because every time my blanket touches my butt I'm overwhelmed with panic and a feeling like I'm about to puke. I have lost friends. I cannot shower without feeling panicked. I let the water run because I become again frozen in fear. Many things that were once normal and comforting now fill me with fear.  
I'm having trouble letting this go without justice. I cannot lie there passively anymore while he gets away with rape. I cannot trust a system that allows him to continue with his life thinking he did nothing wrong. That allows him the confidence to not fear consequences for a choice that can harm a person so deeply. How can he have an easy life when his actions will follow me around for the rest of my life.   
You say you believe me yet you haven't arrested him. How can you expect me to believe you care when you allow the man who raped me to walk free? It feels like you aren't even trying when you don't submit your report to the prosecutors.  I feel there is more you can do. You can ask me more questions or detain Joseph. I need justice and I need closure. I need you to understand what you are saying when you arrest/press charges/continue down the legal path. As far as I'm aware, arrests only require probable cause. So to not arrest him is to say that I wasn't raped. It's to say that hat he did was ok, legally and morally correct. You have the power to continue this so why aren't you? How can you let this go? I have to carry the burden of his actions every day for the rest of my life. Why shouldn't he?  
I'm trusting you to not let me become another statistic, to teach him and others like him that they have a responsibility to obtain consent. I'm trusting you to fight for me, to help me get justice. Please consider charging him with sexual assault. If you still refuse, I need to know why. A detailed and thorough explanation of why there is not enough evidence to establish probable cause. Why despite the evidence of THC in my system, my statements that I did not consent, and his DNA left in my body and on my clothes, you think there is no probable cause. I want you to justify your choice to not continue the legal process. I'm counting on you for justice. Please don't deprive me of it. 

Thoughts, opinions, and advice will all be highly appreciated.  Feel free to pm with questions because I'm done feeling ashamed of this.",0

Asking cause its not talked about in my life. I know I’m into guys. I’ve never had a bf and never have done anything w anyone. Im shy. And don’t really wear the ~sexiest~ clothing lol. I think that might be a fear of people looking at me and getting unwanted attention? Just feel like I suppress my desires and expression which makes me feel like a little kid. Feel like i dress like a little kid most times cause i wear like long flannel shirts, wide leg pants, tee shirts. I like fashion so I wear cool outfits n have lots of clothes lol but also its usually not really fitted or super girly. But then again i don’t know if that look is me. Might be a self esteem thing. Also feel like I only get turned on if i fantasize about someone (a crush) being attracted to me. Never really lasts long though. Earlier I read on here that antidepressants can decrease that, and I am on a few and depressed too, so that is probably the reason. 
Im starting to like a guy right now, and i think he’s a year or two younger than me. I’ve always had problems w talking to guys in the past and since I’ve never dated anyone. How do i flirt or show interest?

Okay.. im basically just asking about how to explore myself and not suppress desires. Also, to those that have therapists, how do u bring this stuff up? Thinking about bringing up the whole self image thing up with mine.

"I want to ask my boyfriend out for coffee tomorrow, but we're supposed to be ""on a break."" Should I still text him?",0,dpvfz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dpvfz6/i_want_to_ask_my_boyfriend_out_for_coffee/,30,1572591073.0,"I don't really know if this is the right sub, but I don't have a lot of ""girlfriends"" to talk this over with in my day to day life. So I just want the friendly loving advice of internet friends lol 

TL;DR at bottom

My boyfriend and I are ""taking a break"" at his request. We just went through something that mainly affected me, but also him as he was kind of caught in this crossfire (post history for more details if you'd like.)

The thing that happened coupled with this whole ""being on a break"" put me in a really delicate state and I've been really stressed and have been having trouble staying motivated to keep going at work, school and just life in general. I'm not alluding to suicide, but I'd sure as hell just rather stay in bed all day and cry. 

During the ""break"" talk, we agreed that is would be okay to text each other occasionally and maybe go get coffee once or twice before we have the talk about what we're going to do next (which is supposed to be in a little over a week.) I'd like to use the coffee dates as temperature checks to see if both of us are doing okay, and if maybe he's had time to think. 

But I texted him the other night and didn't get a response. Which really stung, first of all. I know he's bad at texting, but I feel like communication is something we're supposed to be thinking about and working in during the break, and the text I sent was about plans we had made for a Halloween party and if they were still on. I didn't go since he didn't text back and instead I spent the night watching Netflix. 

The fact that he didn't respond has me nervous, ngl. I struggle already with being able to read his emotions and how he feels because he's bad about talking about them with me. So I don't know if him not responding was intentional, or if he just forgot (which would hurt just as much, if not more) or if he just didn't know what to say. 

Regardless, I love him immensely and the things that I love about him outweigh the bad ten fold. That's not even rose colored glasses, it's just true. And that's why I want to talk to him in person, to see where he's at and how he's feeling. I want to know if he sees a light at the end of this tunnel. 

I want to see him because I'm worried about him, but also our relationship. I've been stressed as hell due to everything going on, and he's my light in the darkness. I just want to see him, but I don't know if it will be healthy for either of us right now. It's been 4 days since we started the break, and if we do a coffee date another 4 or 5 days from now, it might make me feel more confident about the break. 

Idk. What should I say. Or do. I'm at a total loss rn.

TL;DR: Boyfriend and I are on a break, but agreed during the break talk that an occasional text and one or two coffee dates would be okay. Boyfriend didn't respond to a text I sent him the other night, making me apprehensive about how he feels. I'm in a bad place mentally and could use a coffee date with him tomorrow morning, but I'm not sure if I should ask, given that he didn't respond to my earlier texts.

EDIT: I'd like to add that my boyfriend is *awful* at texting and responding to texts in a timely manner. Always has been. So I'm not sure if his lack of response to my text was rooted in his general forgetfulness or if it was because he purely isn't ready to talk yet.",0

Me (27F) and my bf (28M) have together for 1.5+ years. He is a security gaurd. Im 3rd year psychology student but been struggling due to disability and question if ill ever ne able to work.
We don't have much money. I also have psychological issues from being mistreated by my family and have had no contact with them for almost the wholr 6 months.

Im not sure what the pros and cons are really. I have a cruise on the 14th december (10 nights) so Id either have to have the abortion before it or be pregnant on the cruise.

I dont think this place is big enough exactly and I dont think or know if we would handle a baby.
Id probably never be able to work if I kept the pregnancy since Id have to care for the baby and also Im disabled.
My boyfriend made a joke about abortion so I dont think he would really want to keep the baby. I also have no money so he would be paying for the abortion.

Pros: 
1. Gain a family since I lost mine essentially
2. Get to go baby shopping and do everything that I was left out of during my sisters pregnancy (I was excluded).
3. Prove to myself that I can do it. Since my mum bullied me for a year that Im a selfish person and would be a incapable parent (saying cps woukd be involved) and to not get pregnant (while my sister had an Oops pregnancy and raised her kid in the family home heavily leeching off parents). 
4. Maybe only time I could have a baby
5. Gain someone else to talk to since I dont have much friends
6. I may never work anyway and may regret if I thought I was doing this so I could work then actually didn't due to disability
7. I actually loved going to kid centers and only stopped when I was too old because I had no choice so this would be an opportunity to do the childish things I like doing.
8. I feel like Id be a fun parent and the kid would get to do a lot of fun things
9. The thought of having my own baby/child is kind of exciting and I wonder what he/she will look like (i have brown eyes and bf has blue).
10. Boyfriend wants kids but maybe not now.

Cons:
1. I have BPD, complex ptsd and depression and I can't say it wouldn't effect the child. It seems not as bad right now but its on and off.
2. Acne seems to run in my family and migraines and some health issues run in my family.
3. I have severe tokophobia and fear of medical stuff
4. I enjoy living child free
5. Id have to do most of the work carring for the child as my boyfriend is lazy and also works
6. Im not sure I could handle the noise without having a mental break down
7. Im not sure if this house is big enough and we cant afford to move
8. It will likely affect our welfare payments in a bad way.
9. It will damage my body and probably make me gain a lot of fat.
10. May not get to go on a cruise again, unsure. Thus far I have been going on 1-2 a year.
11. I have little money and my bf may resent me uf we are dipping into his.",5

My solution to ending sexual harassment of women,0,dq2x3l,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dq2x3l/my_solution_to_ending_sexual_harassment_of_women/,39,1572636401.0," Had a typical experience of being a woman in this world during my morning run. Guy drives by slowly, goes around the block, and drives by slowly again, making unintelligible noises. The third time, I said to him, ""I've got your license number, so zoom zoom, bitch!"" at which point he applied quite a bit of pressure to the gas and disappeared to harass someone else.

As I continued my run, I contemplated solutions to the problems of male harassment. I considered my experience of sexual harassment, sexual assault, and unwanted attention for the past almost 40 years, as well as my daughter's almost hourly harassment during the year she was at her first high school (thank god for art school and gay guys, she was fine at the charter school). However, she still appears in public, and rides public transportation, and has been catcalled, followed, rubbed up against - all the typical experiences of being a woman. And since we don't become invisible until we are 50, she's got a long road ahead of her.

Women honestly get tired of telling men to behave like reasonable human beings, and threatening violence to those with listening problems. During high school, wearing a school uniform, men regularly made inappropriate comments and rubbed up against my (minor) daughter. She carried a screw driver or a wrench with her everywhere. I had high school friends who carried knives. I can't even recall all the situations I was in, but there was at least one police report (nothing ever happened to the pedophile, of course). 

A lot of men think it isn't their problem, or claim not to witness it. I gotta tell you - saying, ""I didn't realize how bad it was"" or ""I never did it myself, but I saw other guys doing it"" - does \*not\* get you off the hook. You, and the regular Germans during WWII, are culpable. However, I don't expect straight men to solve this problem. They've had 6,000 years of recorded history, and still nothing to show for it...

So, what to do...

I realized that the solution was staring me in the face - open carry, but only for women and people who identify as women. No need for a chromosomal or hymen test - when you live in a patriarchy, you \*know\* when you are being sexually harassed, and so do the harassers.

Since at least 80% of violent crimes are committed by men, as well as 90% of rapes and sexual assaults, I think this could make a really positive reduction in the crime rates in this country, and worldwide...",0

I decided for the entire month of October, there would be no “concessions” on my boundaries. I still cooperated with those who cooperated with me, but I no longer coddled men. 

This didn’t have any impact on my work as I often work alone. 

The biggest difference was dating wise. With men, I’m used to saying “I know he drinks.... but he respects me!” Or “I Know he uses problematic language sometimes, but he doesn’t drink!” And basically *constantly* making excuses for the men around me. Starting in October, this is how a lot of my conversations went: (T)hem, (M)e (for context, this is also technically kinky, but it applies to men I met on OKC too.)

M: hey, just so you know, all sexual play is off the table for a while. I want to make sure I’m with someone that enjoys me, you know? 

T: well I really need to cum.... what about oral?

M: sexual play is off limits. I respect that need and wish you luck in finding fulfillment. 

T: *silence* 

It’s been so fucking freeing. In the past, I would have tried my hardest to accommodate, make everyone happy, but it had the unfortunate side affect of making me unhappy and it wasn’t sustainable. Men have been more hostile to me, but the ban hammer usually shuts them up. The connections I *am* getting though are quality. I’ve had not one, not two, but THREE different quality dates since then. 

I am so proud of myself and what I have worked for. A year ago this wouldn’t have even been possible for me. I’m happy to be standing up for myself. :)",24

I want to share my positive experience with every woman or girl who has only read bad experiences. Like myself.

I've had problems inserting things into my vagina for quite some time. I can't even get the smallest tampon in. I noticed this problem when I was experimenting, around the age of 14, 15, but I was too afraid to talk to anyone about it. 

When I googled my symptoms there was only one possible thing it could be: vaginismus. All websites and articles about not being able to have intercourse or inserting tampons were about vaginismus. You can barely find any information about any other possible causes. I was driving myself insane. ""I'm I causing my own problems?"" ""How do I relax those muscles?"" I even read that ""having a glass of wine before trying to insert anything might help you relax and make it easier!"" As naive as I was, I tried drinking before inserting, and it didn't work.

Then all of a sudden, I read a post written by a fellow redditor on this exact subreddit. It was about imperforate hymen. This post gave me the courage to actually go see a doctor. 

So today, 6 years after I discovered my ""problem"", I went in. Feeling quite nervous. I've read horrible stories about women going to see an OB GYN. Doctors who don't listen to their symptoms, doctors who thing ""having sex will fix it"" and other things.

The doctor was the nicest woman ever. She really made me feel comfortable. She didn't judge me when I told her I was a virgin. She asked if this ""problem"" I have is holding me back in romantic relationships. Which it is. She seemed very understanding. 

When it was time for the actual exam, she was really gentle. She explained exactly what she was going to do. She stopped when she saw I was feeling uncomfortable. It was an uncomfortable feeling, but she didn't hurt me at all.

She took a look at my vaginal opening and found out I do in fact have an imperforate hymen. This was really the diagnosis I was hoping for! I'm going to have it surgically removed in December and even though I feel kinda nervous for the surgery, I'm quite happy I finally found out what my ""problem"" is, and most importantly, that it's treatable.

I'm glad I finally went to an OB GYN today. And eventhough theres a lot of bad stories online, I hope I gave some girl out there the courage to see theirs too.",21

This not knowing has made me irritable beyond belief and I have been acting strange and he’s noticed. If I do find out that it is in fact an STI how should I go about approaching this?",1
I am not an iPad. This is a toxic narrative valuing woman akin to things “for their own good” and HAS TO STOP.,1276,doxpzu,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/doxpzu/i_am_not_an_ipad_this_is_a_toxic_narrative/,243,1572418032.0,"I have seen the following text, usually accompanied my the pic of young lady, shared on FB a few times now:

————————————————
“A girl bought an iPad. When her father saw it he asked, “What is the first thing you did when you bought it?”

“I put an anti-scratch sticker on the screen and bought a cover for the iPad,” she replied.

“Did some one force you to do so?”

“No”

“Do you think it’s a insult to the manufacturer?”

“No Dad! In fact they even recommend using a cover for the iPad.”

“Did you cover it because it was cheap and ugly?”

“Actually I cover it because I didn’t want it to get damaged and decrease in value.”

“When you put a cover on, didn’t it reduce the iPad’s beauty?”

“I think it looks better and it is worth it for the protection it gives my iPad.”

The father looked lovingly at his daughter and said, “Yet if I had asked you to cover your body, which is more precious then an iPad, would you have readily agreed?”

She was mute...

Indecent dressing and exposure of your body’s reduces your value and respect. Always dress decently.

*pls protect our young ladies by sharing this with all sisters*
——————————————

I find this increasingly disturbing the more I see it shared. I am not a iPad. This is a view and rhetoric I grew up with. It is toxic. Woman are not things... we are people. I grew  up in a conservative and loving home however I still struggle to be “valued” on a level playing field as my brother. I still struggle to gain respect for choices a man would receive no criticism for.  It is  because of this narrative of woman as things to be protected and sheltered as objects (what happens when the new Gen iPad gets released? Time to upgrade!) all for their own good on order to keep their value in the opinions of the men, family, church that own them.

Thank you for reading my rant.",1276

I didn’t take it, gave him a friendly hello, swallowed my fear, and said “I’m not interested in talking right now.” And he looked at me, slurred out “That’s your prerogative”, and wandered off. I got on a different train car than him, and had a peaceful ride home. Several weeks ago, I would have been caught up in a one sided conversation for the 30 minute ride home.

I don't know who to talk to about this. My stomach has been in knots for 2 days.

He was in a position of A LOT of power (and influence) in my industry. I'm just starting off as an assistant. I honestly did feel powerless when he would make comments and talk about things he shouldn't (how he hasn't gotten laid in x number of months, how his wife hates being in the sack, etc, etc.) I just laughed it off, ignored it, pretended like I was fine with these things. I was scared that I could be fired if I rejected him, or worse, that he would try to ruin my career (he had done similar things before.) Then it escalated to touching. Then he pressured me to go to a hotel with him after work through text messages. I thought that I finally had real, tangible ""evidence"" of what he was doing and told my manager and our HR department. They were swift, supportive, and absolutely on my side. He was terminated literally the day of my reporting. I mean, I don't know how it all went down but he left. My managers assured me I was safe and that he was in the wrong and they would keep the incident discreet so my name isn't attached to his firing.

You would think I'd be super happy about this but I'm not. I keep thinking to myself, maybe I enabled it, maybe he got the wrong signs from me, maybe I smiled too much, maybe he didn't even mean it. Maybe I overreacted, maybe I could have just let it go, maybe I misinterpreted. I KNOW logically that he was in the wrong- but I'm still reeling from everything. I also did not think that this would go ""my way"" so quickly and easily. I didn't even think this was the ""way"" it could go. I assumed that because he was such an important person that they would just give him a talking-to or a warning. I am sort of guessing that maybe this wasn't his first incident...? That might be why they let him go like this. But who knows.

I just feel strange. Like I caused a huge incident, a huge ripple in our company without even meaning to. Almost like boy who cried wolf too... like maybe I created drama without there needing to be. And on the more human side, I feel bad for him too. He wasn't 100% evil. He has a family too... I didn't mean for him to get fired or be shamed. Maybe he really was just joking around and being stupid, not even realizing how inappropriate he was.

I am very happy with how supportive my managers were and I feel like I can trust them. But the uncomfortable feeling is still there. I'm trying to figure out how to deal with it.",38

I'm in college, and had a crush for a while on a pretty popular guy in our community. I was hyped to find out he was into me too, so we met up a few times on campus. He was a little emotionally distant, but was overall very kind and a nice guy. We never did anything sexual during these encounters, though we had kissed. Fast forward to a party at his place and I get way more drunk than I meant to. According to my friend at the party, he said I could put my stuff down in his room, and he led me there. My friend didn't see me for the rest of the night and went home. I woke up early in the morning in his bed super confused, and he was really sweet and was asking me to stay, but I was still out of it and really disoriented and ubered home. I hadn't been planning on having sex that night or having sex with him, especially so soon. I also know no protection was used because it was like messy. I tried to bring it up a couple days lateru but didn't articulate it clearly and it got really awkward and we haven't really talked since. I just don't know how to feel about it? I think he's still a nice guy, and I probably would've wanted to have sex with him eventually, but I'm still confused about the whole encounter and feel like I think about it more than I should and I don't know how to stop or if I should try reaching out again.

Took a bus work as I rarely do, but I've been sick the whole week and didn't feel like walking today. How sad it was for me to straight away notice an old man taking pictures of some girl's body right in front of me. He didn't even try to hide! As I confronted him asking why was he taking pictures of her, he said ""I am not taking pictures of YOU"" as if it was supposed to offend me? 
Then only after I came up to that girl saying the guy has been shamelessly taking pictures of her, he shouted ""the bag she is carrying has been stolen recently!"". What kind of an excuse is that? It's like he says it probably every time someone confronts him.
After that, I came up to him and took pictures of his face. He freaked out, covered his face with his suitcase (which ironically had a Pope John Paul II sticker on it...) and told me both me and that girl will end up with the police... what a loser :(
I'm really frustrated I couldn't find any local fb page where I could post his picture without it getting deleted :(",23

Instead I pay the women tax of Ubers when I socialise, which adds anything from £10 to £35 or even more to a night out. 

Recently in efforts to budget I said F it and took the Tube & bus. Bus stop right outside Tube. Bus stop about 100m from my front door. And still got harassed. Shooting your shot is one thing but don't keep going when I've already told you no. Keeping on repeating asking for your number etc. and to go on a date etc. when you've already said no is so fucking unfair and annoying. Worse than that is the fear that you will offend them and they will seek some revenge. They know where I live so God knows if they will hang around. This sort of shit is why I should never have stopped wearing a big hat and a really huge coat to hide any attractive features about me if I do go out late at night.

How stupid of me, to think that I could be an attractive woman and just walk 100m to my front door without harassment.

I hate that to be a woman means you must always be scared, wary, on guard, on the defensive. Now I'm worrying about this creep where I should just be able to relax.

I wasn't drunk as I'd only had a couple of drinks.  As I was walking I saw someone I knew.  He was in a circle of friends that overlapped with my circle of friends.  I had seen him on many a night out and had chatted to him many times.  There was no attraction on either side as far as I could tell.  

The journey took us past his flat and he invited me in for a spliff.  I was a seasoned spliff smoker and this was the norm in my social circle.  He had flat mates but none of them were home (I didn't know this when I went in).  He rolled a spliff and I took a couple of drags.  He had either loaded it (put a lot of marijuana in it) or put something else in it because it literally floored me.  I found myself completely unable to move and all I wanted to do was sleep.  At the time I wasn't able to figure out what was happening and just thought I was being a light weight.  I told him I was incapacitated and he offered me his bed, and he said he'd sleep on the floor.  I gladly agreed as I had no other option that I could figure out and I felt desperate for sleep.  I got into his bed fully clothed and tried to sleep.  But after a few minutes he got into the bed next to me and complained of being cold.  He tried to touch me and I moved away and said I didn't want to be physical with him.  He then started to plead and beg for sex non stop.  He wouldn't let me sleep.  Just continued to ask over and over again for sex.  Eventually I said yes so he would leave me alone to sleep. I would never have consented to have sex with him under any other circumstances.  Although I had technically consented it didn't feel consensual.  The next morning I left as soon as I was able.  It was incredibly strained and he was very cold and unfriendly to me as I was to him.  

I slept the rest of the day away feeling absolutely awful.  The next day I saw a close female friend.  I told her about what had happened and said I felt like I had been raped.  She got visibly annoyed and said, ""be careful what you call rape"".  She then went on to say that I consented and calling it rape was casting him in a bad light.  This upset me so much I never spoke about it again with anyone until I met my husband a few years later.

I think what he did was rape and was premeditated and I doubt I was the only one he did it to.  I don't know why my friend reacted the way she did.  It affected our friendship after that and eventually we stopped being friends completely.  She had also victim blamed someone who we knew who had been raped twice in her life.  Claiming that being raped twice meant that she must be culpable in some way.  Her lack of sympathy definitely negatively compounded my experience.",21

I was 13ish when I saw the first Transformers movie and was, like almost everyone else, in awe of her beauty. Then I started watching interviews with her and realized she was super cool. She had this dark humor, was kind of shy, a bit weird (in the best way possible) and really smart. Which honestly made her wonder woman imo. Yeah, she's not that great of an actress, but as a public figure she was someone to look up to. She never got into trouble with drugs or alcohol, it was that she was introduced as a sex symbol and that was all anyone saw when they looked at her. I remember every single comment on those early youtube videos was about her legs on Letterman, or how hot she is, or how people want her to sit on their face! And a lot worst that those actually. Every interviewer seemed to flirt, people legit acted weird around her especially men (just watch this Jimmy Kimmel interaction if you want to be pissed off a bit:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HRR5ubeayg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HRR5ubeayg) ) and it wasn't at all disturbing back then. It was ""funny"" to people. She is an attractive woman, so she must not be human and we should treat her like an object to drool over right?!??! Cause that's all she is. 

For some reason I came across this interview:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-bfAHWU\_I4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-bfAHWU_I4) and the interviewer is not just flirting, or coming onto her but the way he looks at her is disgusting. I can almost see him thinking of hooking up with her, and it's absolutely horrendous. But, here's what I'm more interested in: The comment section. For the first time ever, I'm seeing comments actually calling out this guy and saying how disturbing his behavior is and how pathetic he was for trying to flirt with her and almost every comment is defending her and sympathizing with her for having to put up with this crap almost all the time. I don't know when this happened, but I am so proud of the youtube comment section.

Was walking home from work towards the train station and could hear someone coming up behind me. Not unusual, I’m a slow walker.

Then he kinda does a double take (because he’s already walked past me at this point) and goes “Oh, you are so beautiful!”
Cue more awkward smiling. 

Then he actually SLOWS DOWN to match pace with me and starts asking me what my name is. I’m literally like “Sorry no Englise” with the weirdest not-an-accent accent. He keeps asking my name so I kind of answer in my dumb accent voice because I’m starting to panic because I don’t ACTUALLY know any other languages. 
He keeps asking me other personal questions like where I live, what nationality am I, etc. I just kept shaking my head like I don’t understand and repeating “sorry” every time he asked anything. 

Eventually he just smile and said “Okay have a nice day” and sped off so I guess he bought it?

Is this wrong? Is this right? Justice for my abuser,0,dpgex8,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dpgex8/is_this_wrong_is_this_right_justice_for_my_abuser/,9,1572513905.0,"I don’t know if this belongs here but I need advice and some perspective right now. 


This is my first written post so I’m sorry if it seems amateur. I have been struggling with the effects of abuse from around age 8-15 (not sure how young when it started). I have recently this year told my mother and brother(24y) about being sexually abused as I(18F) have been holding it inside until now. 

To preface a bit I did not realize this was abuse as it was normalized by others I had told (cousins) but not adults. I had felt guilt for many years as a result of a fucked up community in which I never felt like my safety was important. 

Recently my brother has taken some time to click into the severity of the abuse and that it’s deeply affected me. He has just now told me he has given it a lot of thought and decided he is going to tell my father. I have not told my father yet as I was afraid his reaction might be underwhelming and hurt me more. 

My brother wants to get “justice” as I don’t have any solid case and our family would likely defend my abuser(1st cousin). While I don’t want this to uproot my whole life my bother has made some good points to the fact that it already has and that I’ve been dealing with that alone. 

He knows that the justice he wants could send him to prison and says that he is prepared to face that. I don’t want this to happen to him but he says he will harm him with or without my father and or my permission.

Should I feel bad I want this? to make him understand what he has done to me? I feel happy that my brother has so much love for me and my safety but it means him seriously harming this individual. I don’t know how to feel about any of this and I know it’s wrong to let him do this but it feels deserved.

I’ve done so much healing on my own but my family is deeply hurting now. I know what is morally right and wrong but I told him I think it’s okay to do what he feels right to my abuser (not kill of course) with my father.

Whoever you are, guy or girl, you need to look out for your family and community.  You need to offer space and protection without judgement.  You need to investigate suspicious bullshit and make 100% sure.  You need to get victims away from their predators.  You need to confront and report predators.

Somehow predators get an idea its okay when it is enabled.  If you are not zero-tolerance, you are 100% tolerance.

She shouldn't be writing violent revenge fiction 20 years after her uncle sodomized her.

She shouldn't have conflicted feelings about loving her father 20 years after he raped her as a child.

He shouldn't be struggling with sexuality 10 years after his uncle forced him to put his mouth on his penis.

"It's been over a year, and I'm still so annoyed with myself",1,dpfhq3,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dpfhq3/its_been_over_a_year_and_im_still_so_annoyed_with/,18,1572509673.0,"Last year I dated someone. He waited 4 months to meet me (I was living overseas when we matched) and it was an immediate connection. I've never felt so safe and comfortable liking anyone before, it just felt right. I've dated tons of people, had a couple of serious relationships, but this really stood out to me. We could read each other's thoughts and there was a definite strong connection. We spent several months together and we were inseparable. We met each others roommates and friends, we said I love you, and we made plans to go travelling together, to get a dog together (and named him, chose the breed) for when I came back to the city after sorting out my work visa (originally from Europe, moved to North America). 

When I left we were extremely close and really hitting the peak of the honeymoon period together. He left me messages telling me he loves me after he stood crying at the airport saying goodbye. Then a day later, he completely diminished what we shared by saying it was just a fling, and that I always agreed it would be that (I didn't). He gaslighted me and immediately switched off - he became rude, cold and indifferent. He then sent me a long email about how his feelings for me were genuine and real, and that he was just trying to adjust the circumstances and he hates how much pain he has caused me. I then began to date someone else very casually, which he knew about and didn't seem bothered by it. Things got toxic between us and in November, we cut contact. 

In February, I received my visa to go back. I broke no contact and contacted him to get my stuff from his apartment. He was indifferent towards me and rude. I never ended up getting my stuff back. He was already in a serious relationship with someone else, and 2 months later she moved in. I couldn't believe (and still can't) how quickly he moved on. 

5 months later and still thinking about him, I again broke no contact to let him know I was back in the city as originally planned. I didn't expect a response - I simply wanted to clear the air as I began my new chapter back here without him (incase we ran into each other). He sent back an extremely formal and cold email telling me that he won't be my friend, he reminded me that he didn't want me after I left, and that he has found the happiness he deserves. I was stunned. How could he possibly still be holding enough of a grudge against me that he thought an email like this would be necessary? It had been 10 months. We had both been with other people. This was someone who I was so close to that it felt like we were practically telepathic at one stage. 

I then ran into him on a bus. I turned around and he was stood behind me, staring at me. So I went over and said hello. He was rude towards me again. I gave him a hug and kiss goodbye and burst into tears after leaving the bus. This isn't exactly how I pictured us seeing each other again, when I left him crying at the airport 10 months earlier. 

Weeks later, I noticed he deleted a review he left me for my business over a year ago. I'm amazed he even remembered it and took the time to delete it. It seems incredibly random and petty. 

A month or so later is when I found the girlfriend's instagram, and saw how quickly they were saying I love you to each other (pretty much months after I left). They're now the oversharing couple on Instagram. Gushing telling each other they love and miss each other in Instagram comments. They have gone to all the same places we went together. She wears the shirt of his that I used to wear. She is close to the dog that I was really close to. It feels like I have been replicated and replaced. 

That's when I realized I had questions and took back control - wanting to get answers to have my own closure. I wanted to know if anything we shared was real, since it was an immediate cut off. I sent him a short email asking him to meet up with me for coffee, as I had questions I needed to ask him. He ignored it. I then blocked them both on everything, and don't intend on unblocking. 

I'm so frustrated with myself though because I still desperately miss him. I think about him constantly, and yearn for how close we once were. I've thrown myself into my new life here. I go to the gym. I go out with friends. I've been to therapy. I meet up with people from dating apps. I've given a few guys my number. But the same connection and spark just isn't happening. He has moved on and clearly forgotten about me, which is expected. But it feels so strange how quickly he moved on and how little he cares, when I flew over 4,000 miles to be back here. 

It truthfully feels like that connection simply isn't going to happen again. Or it will, but years from now. It's a horrible thing to lose. 

Can any of you ladies relate? Has anyone been through this, and found a better match for them later on?",1
How can I cheer my girlfriend up?,0,dpfgbr,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dpfgbr/how_can_i_cheer_my_girlfriend_up/,3,1572509506.0,"I (M22) and my GF (21) are in a long distance relationship for almost a year now. Due to our studies and also different internships we manage to see each other every 2-3 weeks, but we text everyday and facetime every other day. 

You need to know that my girlfriend completely stresses out over the smallest things. For example over work, or how her appartment is not clean (even though it is) and other stuff. I calm her down when I’m not there, and I’m really clueless of what to do in such situations. 

Lately my girlfriend started a fitness program because she wanted to start working out again, and since this program includes a website where you can track your food and progress.
Around the same time I recommended intermittent fasting to her as I lost weight pretty easily which made her start this too.

The current situation is that my girlfriend seems to have had eating disorders in her past and I think she might fall back to it. Her university and her internship is stressing her out and she completely hates her body atm. She says she just wants to cry and puke if she sees herself in the mirror. (she has not put weight on in my opinion, as I cannot see any difference)

I tried telling her that she should keep going to the gym, as routine and workouts make me happy, but she thinks I just admitted that she is fat and ugly and needs to workout. 

She completely hates herself atm and seems to be depressed. All my previous attempts failed to cheer her up and I really have no clue how I can show her that she is the prettiest girl in the world, which I think she is. 

Tomorrow I’ll visit her for the weekend and maybe you guys have some helpful tips to cheer my girlfriend up.",0

Anyways, lately I've been struggling a lot with coming to terms with something that happened more than five years ago. I had just moved to a different country to study away from home and in a place where they didn't even speak my first language. At the time also had only learned about my mom's cancer diagnosis and it was killing me that I wasn't near her, although I was also relieved at times. 

Anyways this dickhead decided one night, when we were both partying and I had drank far too much to bring me to his room. Everything started off consentual and we kissed and I decided to stay in his bed. I was super drunk and also super inexperienced. In the middle of the night I woke up to him fingering me, and I was just in so much shock I couldn't do anything. I didn't even shout or move away I just lay there still and was wishing for it to be over. I can't believe I let that asshole get away with it and didn't even try to stop him. I just can't believe I let him have this power over me and later that year he raped another girl, which maybe I could have stopped if I came out with this more publicly, but I just stayed still. I hate myself for not stopping him, and just wish I could go back in time.

The first time I realized how differently someone saw me just because I am a woman. And I feel really self conscious,341,dor6up,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dor6up/the_first_time_i_realized_how_differently_someone/,168,1572390727.0,"I’m of the type that doesn’t dwell on negative experiences, if someone is rude I just roll with the punches. Like once in college I asked a boy to be my lab partner for our petroleum engineering class. He looked me dead in the eyes and said. “No you look stupid” I am blonde. I was wearing my sorority jersey. And I am very bubbly. So I understood why he thought that and just got a different lab partner. I know I’m not dumb so I didn’t care. I liked the kid because he genuinely didn’t care about what anyone thought of him. He was there to be the top of the class and he taught me I don’t have to be liked to achieve my goal. (Ps I got the best grade in the class) 

I digress 

Last night my car freaked out in the highway so I took an exit and pulled into the first parking lot. It was a church and a cop was sitting in the parking lot. I called my husband to come get me. And the cop started to leave I flagged him down to ask if he thought my car would be safe here over night. 

He was a nice guy so we got to chatting. He was stationed in the parking lot until 9:30 so he didn’t have to leave and when my husband pulled up, we three continued the conversation. 

I noticed that the cop’s changed slightly when my husband came but I just wrote it off. He started mainly talking to my husband. My husband is in EMS so they were do a bit of shop talk, and I felt it is normal to try to engage the new person into the conversation. 

The cop said to me, “ya, you don’t understand the kind of stuff we see every day. We have tickets to the craziest show on earth.”

I responded that I’m in nursing school so I will be getting season tickets soon.

He said “oh ya you will” he paused then remarked “but you should get a nice quiet job at a doctor’s office” 

I just mentally “huh?-ed “ then hugged my husband and said “well he is going to go to medical school so maybe he will hire me some day.”

We all laughed

But then the cop said “oof sorry man, your gunna get no alone time” and started laughing some more

I stoped laughing and my husband started doing a ‘this is awkward but I will give you a chuckle for social pleasantries’ 

The subject changed and at this point I was ready to be done with the conversation but the cop kept talking, and I had tried to mention we should deal with our car and “we don’t want to keep you” but the cop said “ oh don’t worry about me I have to be here until 9:30 so you are just helping the time pass” 

The conversation continued for a bit, then I started to tell a story I was very excited about when the cop cut me off and looked at my husband and said “is she always like this?”

My husband looked confused and said “what do you mean?”

He said “ I mean, can she always talk like this 😂🤣🤪I’m sorry for you man”

I felt hurt and said “he loves it because he is a big talker too.”

The cop said “have you even taken a breath in the last five minutes 😝”

Then I said (like an idiot) “oh I’m sorry I just talk fast when I am excited “

The whole thing has made me feel so self conscious. And embarrassed. And makes me feel like I should be sorry for my husband just for dealing with me. 

The guy was just “joking” but it still sucked

I know I’m on my period so I’m probably extra sensitive but it really has made me feel bad for who I am

Also things cop said “ah looks like the boss is here” when my husband pulled up and “what do you think the problem is chief “ when my husband started looking at my car.

So I am a 16-year-old girl, and I have two youger half-siblings who live with me. Their dad got kicked out of the house like 3 years ago by my grandma, and I haven't seen him in person in about 2 years. Around a year ago, when I was 14, he messaged me on Facebook telling me that he was attracted to me and asking if I would ever 'do anything with him', which I quickly shut down but never told anyone. A few months ago he asked me if I wanted to go to his house and drink and do drugs with him, and I said sure because I dont know how to say no, but in my mind I knew I wasn't going to go. He also said that I was extremely beautiful once again, which creeped me out. Then he would constantly message me, hitting on me and asking me to 'do pills' with him and I eventually just blocked him. He has also messaged me on all of my social media and my number. My siblings always go see him and I am worried about them seeing someone like him. I want to tell my mom but I don't know how to tell her. I feel guilty because I might be taking my siblings' dad out of their lives, and that was tough for me growing up. I also feel like I'm being too dramatic.

How do I get my boyfriend to stop mansplaining to me?,0,dpcwj5,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dpcwj5/how_do_i_get_my_boyfriend_to_stop_mansplaining_to/,18,1572498551.0,"Hello all! I made a throwaway account for this because my bf, who I love dearly, also uses reddit and I'd prefer he not find this.  

One of my only problems in our relationship is the fact that my boyfriend's default mode seems to be that I don't understand things, if that makes sense. We'll be having a discussion and he'll suddenly start explaining concepts to me that I'm pretty familiar with and I haven't given any indication that I'm confused about. When he finally finished his explanation I'll be a little annoyed and be like ""I know that"", because well, I usually do know the things he'll just randomly start trying to teach me. When I do not understand things I'm totally comfortable with making it clear that I don't and will often ask for explanation. I'm pretty communicative with when I do understand things and when I do not. So I wish he would stop assuming that I need things explained to me constantly if I haven't given any indication.  It's fucking exhausting.  

I've tried expressing this to him before and he always says like ""I was just confused and thought you didn't get it."" I let this slide for a little because it seemed like an honest miscommunication, but now it's at the point where I wish he would know better than to just jump to it automatically. When I brought it up again today he just got offended at the word mansplaining and didn't really seem to sympathize with where I'm coming from at all. He didn't apologize or try to see my side.

I found out very early on, about 3 weeks in. It took me 4 weeks to make the final decision. I want nothing more in this world than to have a family. I grew up poor, was relentlessly bullied, missed out on doing any sports or extra curricular activities for lack of money, and my mothers unwillingness to drive me to and from said activities. Ever since I was young my dream has been to be a stay at home mom, taking care of my kids, home, and husband. Give them the childhood I had missed out on.

I'm currently single and about to turn 30. The father is a couple years younger and things are complicated. He says he has similar feelings for me as I do for him, but hes not looking for a commitment. He says we are going to end up dating, but no idea when ect. I ask him over and over to just leave me alone then until he figures stuff out because I am not ok with being with him while he is with other people. But it gets even more complicated because we live in the same house (seperate rooms) and he keeps pulling me back in no matter how far away I stay, for any length of time. He just pulls me back in and I fall for it because, feelings. 

I told him I was pregnant the day I found out. The only thing he said was ""we should talk"" that's it. He wouldnt actually say anything. I had to push and push for him to actually say how he felt like 2 weeks later. All he said was that this was not how he planned for things to go and he is not ready by any means. Nothing else was said.

I made the decision and called for an appointment scheduled for 2 days later. I told him I had an appointment and that he was going with me. We get there and he realized it was an abortion clinic then gets mad at me for making the appointment last minute and I could have told him weeks ago ""after I explain multiple times I JUST made the decision/appointment 2 nights ago.

Then the next day is here and on my way home he calls me and says ""I still want to go to the gym tonight"" I hung up the phone without saying a word and I get a text saying I am rude as f*ck. He gets home and says the same thing. As soon as I'm taking the second pill he leaves. 20 minutes after hes gone it starts and I am all alone. For the first hour I am just writhing in pain and hysterically sobbing because of the reality of the situation. I knew it was going to be the worst part and why I wanted him there, but he was gone. 2 hours pass and he gets back. I'm rushing to the bathroom because the flooding of blood is happening again, and he just asks ""how long is this supposed to last""? I told him idk and yelled that I asked him to be here. He has the gall to say ""I was here"".  

I know I made the right decision. I am not in any place to be able to bring a child into this world. I could not provide it with a decent life at this point even though it kills me. I have no family, I am not well off, I am all alone. But God was this fucking hard. 

I have not been able to go to work for a week. I have a myriad of health issues. Depression and anxiety being the ones that's making this most difficult right now. Everytime I think about going back to work,I panic. This entire time since I've told him I'm pregnant he has not missed a single beat. Still made plans, went out and kept on living his life. Never checking in with me. Meanwhile I'm killing myself for 4 fucking weeks with doctors and decision making. Gradually losing my mind and will to live. 

TL;DL:  If someone you know has to make the decision to have an abortion, talk to them, if they ask you to be there, be there. If you are equally responsible for the pregnancy, you need to be there to help with the decision process. It is NOT all up to the woman. You need to bear the responsibility as well. 

If you have an abortion you are not less of a woman, or less of a decent human being. I know all this and yet I can't shake this feeling. Knowing I am capable of carrying a child, being so close to actually having a child to take care of and love, but ultimately knowing that it is still a dream, as I am in no place to be able to actually give a child a good life as I can barely do so for myself.",3
Weirdly disappointed that my ultrasound came back with nothing abnormal?,0,dpe4op,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dpe4op/weirdly_disappointed_that_my_ultrasound_came_back/,10,1572503688.0,"I’ve been having pain where my right ovary is for a while and it ranges from a dull throb to a sharp pain. I sucked up my fear of doctors and went in for a pelvic exam and had a follow up ultrasound today. They found a cyst on my right ovary but it’s *just* barely too small for them to worry about so basically I was told to suck it up unless it gets worse.

I’m weirdly disappointed by this? Like yeah it’s absolutely *lit* that nothing is particularly wrong but it hurts pretty much all the time. And I’m not supposed to take otc pain meds because I really messed up my stomach taking too many ibuprofen for severe knee pain growing up.

I guess I just wish I didn’t waste time and money to be told it’s something, but not enough. I feel like I complained about nothing and my anxiety keeps saying the doctors are probably just rolling their eyes at me. Idk.

Just so I don’t feel like an idiot for going into a doctor and getting tests for this, has anyone else had this happen? Is there anything to do to make the cyst(s) go away and not come back? Is there something I can do to make it maybe not hurt?

Yes, worse than Saudi Arabia apparently. Also, I'm a WOMAN, since the women on this sub will scoff at a ""dirty brown Indian man"" degrading his women or...something.

We have a lot of problems in villages etc, but it is nowhere near the worst.

The only things I've ever ""dealt"" with over 7 years are creepy looks. I'm not unattractive at all but I've never been catcalled which probably happens in the US. Men are very respectful. This is my experience. None of my friends have experienced that sort of misogyny. You can wear short skirts/shorts (in big cities especially). Men are naturally non judgemental as far as I've seen about this kind of thing.
My friends are basically more into feminism a la ""pink tax"".

We had a female prime minister before the US. Our base culture, historically, is probably one of the most liberal cultures (based on Hinduism, Buddhism etc). Sex was not taboo, women weren't seen as this big ""threat"" or disrespected in a ""slutshaming"" sort of way I guess We have an extremely old ancient book on sex (Kama sutra). Most ancient temples have ""erotic art"". The most respected and fierce gods in Hinduism are women.

It is a unanimous idea in our country (both by men and women) that our country sucks for women. You'll rarely see men denying this despite it being not as bad as we say it is. You don't see this in the majority of middle Eastern countries. Men aren't usually those MGTOW types. Men are quite humble/don't butt into this topic.

Contrary to popular belief, freedom of press for leftist beliefs is exceptional. Journalists will kill themselves over and over for a woman to write an op ed on say, getting made fun of in the workplace or something. It's ""woke"" and ""hipster"" to write about those issues. It increases your ""social justice"" image. The narrative of ""evil India"" comes entirely from us and our own newspapers, not from the superior west trying to study us and coming up with a ""balanced view"" among all the woman hating, minority hating articles.

About the ""rape epidemic"". It's racist as fuck so you can shut up about it, and I'm saying that as a woman I'll remind you. The British made this narrative of ""dark brown dirty rapists, raping our pristine white women"" to justify their violence during their rule. If you're going to talk about ""Indian rape"", you should talk about rape in the middle East too. 

Our reported rape rate is much lower than the US and UK, South Africa and many European countries so their is no basis in talking about a rape epidemic. we record our rapes, unlike many countries and we make a big deal out of every single one, which the US usually doesn't. If you start talking about the reported rape rate: even if you multiply the number by 40 to reach a more accurate rate it is much less than the US (assuming that 100% of rape crimes are reported in the US).

There ARE exceptions, in a lot of poor villages in North India it's probably almost as bad as Saudi Arabia.",0

For example, when I feel insecure in a relationship, I obsess over what is making me feel insecure and in that way I feel I’m controlling the situation. Then I make decisions that hurt myself my partner and the relationship.
Another example...being single at the age of 30 gives me intense anxiety so I obsess over it.

I know this is not the most popular opinion. When women or other bleeders complain about their menses I completely understand but I feel left out, because I love my period. It started after I got off of birth control years ago; I just started feeling so much more connected to nature and its rhythms. 

Yes, I get painful cramps that incapacitate me for at least the first day. My flow is really heavy so I am fatigued for days. My pms is terrible and I act and feel like a monster version of myself...

But ever since I had an abortion, my period is something that I look forward to and cherish every month. The regularity of my cycle, the oh my god how much weight did I gain oh wait it’s just my period fluctuation, dealing with my blood; it makes me feel like I’m really alive. 

I have never felt more of a woman than when I was pregnant and that was very difficult for me because I have identified as gender non binary since before I got my first period. I present as cis (I am visually a very girly female) and had come to terms with my choice of presentation until I started feeling pregnant. The amount of dysphoria I experienced is something I’m still unpacking now; 9 months after my abortion. 

Even if there is no possibility of pregnancy- my period is such an overwhelming relief.  My period signifies my freedom. The blood is beautiful, even when I’m cleaning it off the seat or out of my underwear for the millionth time. I love my period.

Now my question is i already have a big butt but its a little bit saggy after i lost the weight but definitely visible, i want to train it and hopefully in a few months i will see positive results and maybe till next November i may achieve my dream butt?

But recently I have felt good about my makeup skills and how to look natural ish. My mom and friends says how nice and clear my skin looks like so this has boosted my confidence. 

But today while waiting for the tram with two friends, there was a delay. One guy comes up to me and asks if I can check the app and see if something is causing the delay. 
I was curios too so I checked and I said nothing was reported. 
Then he suddenly leans forward towards me and whispers that I wear too much makeup? 

Usually these type of things from a stranger doesn’t bother me, but damn it affected me more than I expected. 
I only use a light bb cream, concealer for my acne, mascara and some roughe/bronzer to give my face some life to it after hiding my red skin and spots. Less than most my friends use daily. 

So angry that he hurt me more than I expected but trying to think that his opinion doesn’t matter to me and I look beautiful with or whitout makeup. I just got more stares or comments when I showed my acne so makeup is then the saviour to avoid that.

Firstly I want to apologize if it is not the correct community to post this, but I have read some advice you had written in threads here, and I think you may help me. I am a fresh graduate in mechanical engineering and currently unemployed. Low self-esteem and lack of confidence are affecting my job search and my mental health.

During college, I had a great academic performance ( I was the second-best among all students )  and completed an internship program in a company in the oil and gas field. For some time I was promised a great position once I graduated, but, unfortunately, the condition of the industry rapidly worsened, and for now, there are no open vacancies.

Now I find my self in my job hunting, with some specific knowledge that, apart from in that company I worked at, is completely irrelevant in my area. I applied for several jobs in other states and even abroad, but I received no answers at all.

Well, I know that experience should not be demanded from fresh graduates, but I feel very insecure talking about fields that I had no contact with in interviews. These consecutive failures made me also doubt on other skills, like soft skills and English proficiency.

I find no amusement in activities that I used to engage in (programming, improving my English and German, etc), and all job application thing has been a punch to the gut. So, for the last three months,  I spent most of the days in irrelevant things, sleeping or crying.

I know that seeking medical advice is the best thing I could do now, but is not an option due to my financial situation. I wanted to be doing something that put me closer to being hired but it is not clear to me what I could do. 

Advice and book suggestions are welcome! :)

To the people who try to control what their girlfriend wears: your insecurity is not our problem.,28,dovzyp,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dovzyp/to_the_people_who_try_to_control_what_their/,45,1572410923.0,"So I just want to make a quick post aimed at anybody who tries to tell their SO that they shouldn’t wear certain outfits that they consider to be “too revealing”, “slutty” or “inappropriate”, because they’re scared that it’ll attract the kind of attention you’re not happy with. I hate to break it to you, but if your girlfriend, wife, partner, or whatever you want to call her, intends to cheat on you, she’s going to do it regardless of what she’s wearing. 


I could be at the club in nothing but a g-string, with all the eyes in the room watching me, and I’m still not going to respond favorably to random dudes hitting on me if I’m in a relationship. Equally, in the case of someone who’s not happy in their relationship to the point where they’re willing to cheat, they could be at the store in sweatpants and an old T-shirt, and if someone hits on them, they’ll lap it up. I’ve been flirted with when I’m dressed to the nines, when I’m just walking to class in my everyday clothes, hell, I’ve been hit on when I’m at a bus station with 5th-day hair, makeup cried off and just wearing an extremely oversized sweatshirt. Thirsty people are everywhere. 


If you find yourself wanting to tell your partner that what they’re wearing is too revealing, ask yourself this - is it that you don’t want other people looking at them? People are going to look no matter what someone’s wearing. There’s nothing you can do to stop it. Is it that you’re scared of people hitting on your partner, and your partner flirting back? In this case, the issue is a lack of trust, which needs to be addressed. Is it that you’re worried about your partner’s safety, or them being taken advantage of? That’s noble of you, but assaults happen regardless of how the victim is dressed. It’s a sad reality, but you policing your partner’s outfit choice isn’t going to be the difference between whether they are safe or not. 


Almost all of the time, I dress up and show off my assets because I feel good about myself, and want to feel beautiful for myself. The rest of the time, it’s so my partner gets to show off that their girlfriend is hot as hell. I only accept a partner who wants me to feel confident, and is secure enough in our relationship to know that I dress the way I do because it makes me feel good. That’s should be the standard in every relationship. Do not settle for someone who wants to control something as simple as what you wear.",28

There's a sign in the women's bathroom at work that really bothers me,26,doull8,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/doull8/theres_a_sign_in_the_womens_bathroom_at_work_that/,21,1572405185.0,"This sign has been posted in the women's restroom at work above the sanitary receptacle at least since I started here in 2005. The facility staff (mostly male) decided some time ago that the effort to empty each sanitary receptacle every day was too much, and that the receptacle would be used instead as a dispenser for wax bags. They posted a sign in each stall. Every aspect of this sign bothers me. 

Picture of the sign here: [https://imgur.com/a/GNccgFy](https://imgur.com/a/GNccgFy) 

Going line by line: 

""This dispenser is for brown wax bags **ONLY**! Please do **NOT** deposit **ANY** feminine hygiene products inside this dispenser."" --> I should mention that I'm in the US, so I can't account for elsewhere in the world, but this is the only restroom I have ever seen these receptacles used as dispensers. Through a quasi-cursory google search, I can't find any indication online that they have ever been marketed as a dispenser of wax bags. I have only found them marketed as receptacles. Example:  [https://www.uline.com/BL\_7026/Sanitary-Napkin-Receptacles](https://www.uline.com/BL_7026/Sanitary-Napkin-Receptacles). I can't help but read this line as ""How can you not know this is a dispenser, not a receptacle?"", especially given the choice of bolding and underlining.  

""Remove one wax bag for your use and place it in the trash container outside of the stall before washing your hands."" --> The provided wax bags become somewhat translucent when wet, and the aforementioned trash receptacle is located at the other end of the bathroom. This means you have to walk past other women waiting to use the bathroom holding your filled wax bag (which is not the sealing kind of bag). The trash container also has no lid or top, so your used wax bag and contents will be visible to all other visitors to the restroom until enough paper towels have been used to cover it. Finally, I feel the indication that women would need to be told to wash their hands after this process very demeaning. 

""Thank you for being considerate of others."" --> I feel that this line is trying to infer that the receptacle is being used as a dispenser to better the bathroom experience for women, and that women who expect to use the receptacle as intended are being rude. 

If they want an easier option than sanitary disposal units that need to be cleaned every day, I'm all for it, but they have both put no effort into making sure the solution is sufficient, and for some reason have written a sign to be as demeaning as possible. 

Should I be as bothered by this as I am? Is re-purposing the receptacle as a dispenser a common occurrence?",26

I think my younger cousin is developing an eating disorder,1,dp62fx,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dp62fx/i_think_my_younger_cousin_is_developing_an_eating/,1,1572467462.0,"I'm not really sure if this post if appropriate here but I'm not sure where to put this. So anyways...

My F (16) cousin, has never been overweight in her life, has always been a healthy 'normal' size, never having issues with eating or anything like that. Something I have picked up about her more recently is that she is easily influenced by her friends. She has a new best friend and they have been friends for about a year now. I have met her multiple times and is a really nice girl but I'm convinced that my cousin is picking up certain things from her regarding food and attitudes towards it. 

Our family owns holiday homes in France and we go on family holidays over there every August. The previous years she was fun and 'normal', this year she was different. She had lost weight (which my Aunt praised her for in front of the whole family...) her face looked thinner, she would always make comments of the calories in foods on the table, comments about how she wishes she could eat the amount of food her brother could eat and still be thin, she didn't smile anymore.

Myself and my Fiance had been keeping an eye on her and noticed the tiny amounts of food she would take from the table. One night she took a couple of leaves of salad and half a piece of salmon. She sat inside on her own to eat and my fiance came inside and saw her throwing her untouched food in the bin - she spent the rest of the night in her room and the bathroom.

Last night we went out for a meal with the family, her best friend was also there. They looked for the options with the smallest calories and two ordered salads with a side of nachos to share. The best friend did exactly what [Cassie out of Skins](https://youtu.be/X8yIqhHPr70?t=188) did when explaining how she fools people in to thinking shes eating. She cut up her fish and moved it around the bowl, mushed the leaves around a bit and tucked the fish out of sight. Neither of them touched the side of nachos.

After the holiday everyone seemed to notice that something was up. My mum approached my aunt and asked her if everything was okay with her and my Aunt assured her and seemed quite shocked/offended that it was even brought up. I don't know how my Aunt can be oblivious, maybe shes in denial? I don't know.

I want to talk to her about this so badly, and I probably will at some point. But I would love some advice on approaching/speaking to her about this. Any advice, tips would be helpful.

After urging from my mom and the local police I filed for a restraining order. I got it, even though the local judge made me feel stupid because he didn’t actually hurt me, just threatened me.

It’s been 7 years. I’m married to a wonderful man now. Several times since that restraining order my ex has sent me threatening messages or attempted to contact me. I’ve notified the police each time but it wasn’t enough to get a new restraining order. I still do a double take whenever I see a man in public with his build.

I have frequent dreams about him finding me and hurting me. I had one last night and realized it’s been 10 years since I first met him. I got to work and googled his name. The first result was a YouTube video of him sitting in court without bail for a domestic violence and strangulation charge.

I also had a lot of pain associated with it 8 months afterwards.

Anyways, that was my last experience with the gyno until today. I didn't get the full exam today due to there not being enough time (univeristy medical staff). She did, however, want to check my IUD. So I got into position, and I started to tense up even though there was no reason to. She went inside and check everything, but as she was doing it, I couldnt stop crying. It didn't hurt or anything. Im not entirely sure why I couldn't stop crying to be honest. I just think I was seriously traumatized by my last experience.

Anyways, I feel like embarrassed as hell. I'm 26 and crying like a child during a gyno exam. I have to go back in two weeks to get to actual full exam done, and I will try to do my best not to cry.

I was raped by the guy I was falling in love with [Trigger warning],14,doued7,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/doued7/i_was_raped_by_the_guy_i_was_falling_in_love_with/,5,1572404368.0,"I am don't even know what I am trying to get from posting this here, but I feel like I need to vent. I have a ton of things going on in my head and I have a hard time trying to make sense.

I grew up at a home with basically no sex education, other than ""don't have sex"", and where I was a constant disappointment. When I was 13 I heard my father calling me a slut. When I was 14 my mom talked with me because my father was sure I was soon gonna be a pregnant teen.

This story happened 10 years ago, I had just turned 16. I was started dating a guy, let's call him Daniel. I liked Daniel a lot. It was the first time I felt someone noticed me. 

I remember I always thought he was cooler than me because he was more ""experienced"" and I wanted him to think I was cool too. 

Daniel and I were both in highschool and our classes started at 2pm so we used to spend our mornings together. In the begining we used to meet at malls or parcs but at somepoint we started to hang out at his place (Daniel lived with his mom but during the mornings he had the place by himself), we would watch movies and make out. With time the make out sessions started to become more and more intense. It was all completely new to me, but I was having fun. I couldn't believe someone finally found me attractive and cared about me, it felt like he really wanted me to enjoy. 

Daniel knew I was a virgin and was okay with it, he seemed to understand I wasn't ready and respected my boundaries. We had talked about it a lot. I remember one day I said I wanted to have sex with him but that I still needed time, it was scary to me because I wasn't comfortable with my body.

One day I went to his place and the usual make out started. It went as far as I was comfortable with and then he asked me if I wanted to try to go further, I said yes. He immediately took a condom out and I panicked, so I nervously told him I had changed my mind and I didn't want to anymore, to what he responded ""oh comme on, just the tip"", I said I didn't want to. From this point and on it felt like he stopped listening to me, like I wasn't there.

He took my panties off. He opened my legs and got on top of me and I was nervously laughing saying I was sorry to change my mind while trying to take him off of me (just for reference, Daniel was a big 1.90ish tall guy and I am 1.65), he held both my wrists on top of my head with one hand and started to kiss me while I kept talking and asking him to stop. I started to cry, I thought the crying would kill the mood for him. He grabbed his penis with his other hand and started to get it inside of me, it seemed difficult but to be honest I don't remember feeling any physical pain. I do remember he was looking me dead in the eyes while doing it, he had never looked at me that way. Once he got in he let my hands free and I felt all his weight on me. I was crying and pushing him with all my strength still asking him to please stop. I am not sure how long I begged but at somepoint I was the one who stopped. I stopped fighting, I stoped pushing and kicking, I stopped crying desperately, I stopped feeling. I just laid there with a blank stare. I lost track of time. I felt like I was looking at this scene form another's person perspective.

When he finished, he laid by my side and kissed my cheek. He looked so happy, he said ""WOOOOW"" and asked me if I had liked it too. I was still just staring at the ceiling, with quiet tears running down my face. I started to doubt if what happened had really happened. Did I just make this all up in my mind? Was it supposed to happen this way? I couldn't understand why I felt so broken while he was so happy. 

I got dressed as quickly as I could, and just said I needed to leave. He finally saw me, I was shaky and full of tears, he seemed truly confused and worried so when I was at the door about to leave he asked me what was wrong and I said ""I told you I didn't want to do it"", and I left. 

A couple minutes later he sent me a text saying ""I can't believe I just raped my girlfriend"". Everything from here is very blurry. The next thing I remember is like a month later he officially became my boyfriend and we stayed together for 2.5 years, until I discovered him cheating. 

To this day I still can't explain why I had zero record of what happened that day. All those memories came back to me 3 years later, when I was already dating another guy and we were playing, he was on top of me tickling me (fully dressed, nothing sexual), I tried to push him away but I couldn't move him at all, and BOOM i remembered everything. I remembered my desperation, I remembered his smell, I remembered his groaning on my ear, I remembered his eyes looking at me.",14

This is not a good update at all.  It’s been over 4 months since the break up. Things have really gone down hill. 

For 6 weeks after the break up we hung out as though things were normal and like we we’re still together. Which lead to a lot of depression and anxiety for me. It lead to constant tension and fights between us. Eventually I told him I needed time away and to focus on myself. He told me he would support my efforts to be happy and healthy. I became suicidal and reached out to him. He ignored me. Shortly there after we met. He told me he didn’t believe I was suicidal. He also told me to “move the fuck on”.

Essentially I’ve been blocked since. 

I continue to be extremely depressed and suicidal. I do see a therapist. Yes she is aware. 

I don’t know what to do with all of this. Everyday is worst day of my life.",0

It was the strangest thing!  Was he worried the deer would hear me? With all those sidewalks in the forest, the sound of the heels would be really distracting? Or maybe the extra traction of that one huge rear spike would give me an advantage?  

And why was he only concerned about the shoes?  Because I've been deer hunting (I was a kid; my dad hunts occasionally) and I'm totally sure that none of my work outfit transfers over!  The blazer and the slacks are also the wrong choice!  And I'd guess that there's pretty much no chance that work clothes easily transfer to deer hunting gear for either gender working downtown.

Is it normal to feel a type of discomfort towards your supervisor for one silly reason?,6,dov26x,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dov26x/is_it_normal_to_feel_a_type_of_discomfort_towards/,7,1572407153.0,"I work at a big company and we have different departments where we can get moved to fairly often (every few years or so). The last department I was working in was a little overwhelming, management was bad and we constantly had to stay over time because of mistakes made by other departments or because of the workload thrown at us at the end of the day. I was really unhappy there but I knew there was a move coming. They asked us what section we would like to go to and i wrote down mine. 

One day,  i quietly broke down at the amount of bullshit we had to deal with, and unluckily, the department supervisor happened to see me. Ever since he got there, he gave me some weird vibes but I didn’t think anything of it. Well, He came to talk to me about what was wrong and I tried to keep it short and said I was just overwhelmed but I was alright, it was just a bad day. He then told me that i was being moved to another section, “I decided to moved you there because i trust you and i know you can do it” . Basically the department I got moved to is almost the same as the one I was before, except more paperwork and more risk ( if you make a mistake there, it can cost a lot of money). I was so surprised that he moved me there, some of my other coworkers that have the same qualifications than I do, were moved to the department I requested to move to. 

I was really sad but I wanted to be positive and took it as a “complement.  A bunch of people from work went to a reunion outside the office, I went as well and my supervisor was there. I had jeans on and my car keys were hanging a little form my front pocket when suddenly he approached me and grabbed my keys and pulled himself near me. Though it was a small gesture, It made me so uncomfortable. He then talked to me about how I was feeling about the move, which I said I was ok. Then a couple of hours later there was a big ball that someone had won on a machine, and it was on the table in front of me and he bounced it onto my face. Which I found incredibly rude but I let it go. At that point I was kinda happy I didn’t have to deal with him anymore in the new department. 

Then a few weeks after the work move, I find out that he got moved too and he is now that departments supervisor. Then I heard from a coworker that he had requested me to move to that section, but I can’t help to think he moved me there simply because he knew he was going to be the supervisor. 

Now I have to deal with him all over again. I avoid him as much as I can but he’s always coming around. He tries to talk to me and joke with me and i just can’t stand it. Today I stayed over for another 30 minutes because of some work bullshit and when I was leaving he caught me outside the office and began trying to talk to me, asking me If I was learning anything new blah blah. I said yes but I continued walking slowly, and he then asked me what I was doing and why I was walking away when he was talking to me? I politely told him I had to go and he finally just let me go. 

Is It normal to feel this way? Or am I overreacting? I’m finding it incredibly exhausting to fake my smile and be the cheerful person I’m expected to be.",6
I'm not scared of tampons anymore.,23,dop13s,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dop13s/im_not_scared_of_tampons_anymore/,6,1572380626.0,"I'm not sure why I'm sharing this with a bunch of internet strangers, but I felt good about it and I guess I wanted to share.

I've been having periods for 7 years and I've always hated them. The bleeding, the cramps, the terrible mood swings I used to get, not to mention the general irritation I feel about having to deal with this crap when I never want kids.

 When I first heard what a tampon was, I was repulsed. I was still pretty young, so my first thought was 'I have to stick *that* up *there*?'. I thought it was disgusting, so I stuck with pads. However, I eventually got sick of how bulky and messy pads were, so I figured I would give tampons a try. Tried it, had no real idea what I was doing and felt really uncomfortable because it wasn't in properly. Stuck with the pads some more.

A few periods later, I tried again. Same problem. The next time after that I tried it, I managed to get it in the right spot and I was thrilled. No pain and no feeling like I was wearing a bloodstained nappy/diaper. The problem came when I tried to take it out and it got stuck. That day I learned about the existence of the hymen, specifically the septate hymen. I freaked out at first, wondering why the tampon wasn't coming out and what was the fleshy string it was stuck on. Eventually I got it out with some help, but it hurt. After that I avoided tampons like the plague. Until now.

I figured I could try tampons again after losing my virginity, but that hasn't happened yet and probably won't for a while. I kept getting frustrated with pads but was still too afraid of getting another tampon stuck and hurting myself or something. I recently returned home for a week or so to spend some time with the family when Aunt Flo popped in and I was unprepared.

My family is full of girls, so there were pads available, but supply was low because none had been bought recently and when I went to change there were none left, so I assumed I wasn't the only one bleeding this week. Then I was faced with a decision: beg mum to go buy some more that very moment (I can't drive and it's a really long walk) or try the tampon she offered. I thought about it for a while. On the one hand, I was worried about it getting stuck again, on the other it had been a couple of years since my last attempt and it may have been a one-off bad experience.

I eventually caved. Putting it in was no trouble, met no issues with it sitting in there, but got nervous taking it out. I pulled and... no problems! It came out pretty easily. I used a couple more today and still no problems. It felt great! For the first time ever I'm a little less pissed about having periods since I'm not having to constantly deal with the same mess as pads make. I'm still using some for night and stuff, but it's nice not to go to the bathroom during the day and find I've leaked out the back or sides because it moved.

Thanks for listening, I just felt excited by this little thing because it felt like a personal victory.",23

while we were cuddling he put his hand down my pants and started fingering me which i didnt mind, but then tried to put his finger in my ass which i said stop and swatted his hand away so he stopped. i was kind of giggling when i said no because it seemed more like a joke. few mins later he started to do it again was telling me i liked it cause i was laughing. i said come on stop and he told me wanted to do anal. i said hell no. we did it once years ago, it didnt feel good, and i couldnt sit right for a week. i told him i was going to sleep, took a shower, then got into bed.

a half hour later he got into bed and woke me up by putting his hands up my nightgown. we started having sex again, and he tried to do anal and i said stop but he said he wanted to cum in my ass and not to be scared and did it anyway. it hurt like hell, i was still half asleep, and i just let it happen. after it was over i went into the bathroom and cried and he said oh i think youre bleeding and when he said that it made me throw up. i stayed in the bathroom for about 20 mins and when i went back into the bedroom he was asleep.

yesterday morning i asked him about it and he said sorry, he barely remembered it, he was beyond drunk and he didnt mean to cause me any harm or upset me and he wouldnt do it again, but then he winked and said unless you liked it. i made it clear that i didnt like it, i dont wanna do it again and he said fine and apologized again and that was it.

i just feel weird, not even sure how to explain it. i love him but i cant get the image out of my head of him holding my legs and doing that to me after i said stop. i thought about it all day yesterday and last night, and it was the first thing i thought of when i woke up today. 

im not sure what to do.

So sick of imaginary double-standards,0,dp5wgk,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dp5wgk/so_sick_of_imaginary_doublestandards/,42,1572466526.0,"I see so many men here on Reddit starting arguments with ""if the genders were reversed..."" when it doesn't apply at all.

For example, someone post something about a woman doing something bad, 99% of commenters are agreeing that this woman is bad, yet half the posts are saying ""I can't believe people think this is ok! if the gender were reversed people would be having a fit! Women are such hypocrites!"" When in fact there is no woman saying it is ok.

They even use this argument where women are judged more harshly than men.

Per example, there is currently a thread on AITA about a woman who posed nude for an art class where some of the students were her bf's friends. 90% of comments are calling her the asshole, saying she ""humiliated"" her bf by posing nude in front of his friends without telling him. The very few people who are saying she is not an asshole are being called hypocrites because they would presumably have a different judgement if the roles were reversed (which I highly doubt). So, despite the overwhelming majority of people calling her an asshole, most of the comments were complaining about how the Reddit is biased in favor of women (which I find to be the opposite).

In reality, I feel like most women would not care if their boyfriends posed nude for an art class, even if their friends were in that class (maybe it's because I was an art student but I really don't see the big deal).

&#x200B;

EDIT to add: A lot of people are discussing the AITA thread. My point wasn't so much to say people were wrong to call the girl an asshole, but that they were wrong to say that people would have been harsher on the OP if he was man.",0

Basically, I (18f) have had the implant since I was 15 due to my period being super heavy for 9 days, but it just meant that they became lighter, but for 2 weeks. Two weeks on, two weeks off. Literal hell.

So my mum who is a nurse said that I could see a GP and get the pill as well, which has been amazing. My moods have been really stable, no period whatsoever and both act as a contraceptive, so all round 9/10!

However, when I do forget to take my pill for around 4/5 days, I turn a bit psycho. Instantly angry/annoyed, super sensitive, crying a lot, massive high and low mood swings. 

Does anyone else get this? What's going on in my body? Should I get it checked out? 

I need to tell my mum but as I'm at university, I call her/she calls me a few times in the week and I just forget to mention it, but it isn't something that can be explained over text, ygm?

&#x200B;

When I was a teenager I experienced incredibly heavy and painful periods. I couldn't go to school,  couldn't eat, and would spend days laying on the couch in excruciating pain.  I asked my mom to go on birth control and since we lived in a very small town there was only one doctor who would prescribe it.  So she made the appointment and we went.  I was probably 14-15 years old and at the time I had also been struggling with self harm and depression.  The doctor obviously noticed this and would ask me about it which of course made me incredibly upset.  For four years I would go see her about every 6 months and every single time she would perform the incredibly painful, ""required"" pelvic exam,  ask me about my self-harm  and I would cry for HOURS after the appointment.  I really tried to hide how upset I was from my mom but at my last appointment I couldn't hold it back and we stopped going to see this doctor.  

&#x200B;

At 25 years old I still cannot go see a gynecologist without breaking down into tears during the appointment for no reason.  I feel completely helpless and belittled no matter how nice the doctor is.  I have always been an anxious person but the experience I had today made me realize how deep my issues are with doctors and gynecologists specifically. 

&#x200B;

I have never had an anxiety attack before.  At the same time I felt like I was breathing in so much air my lungs would pop yet never felt like I was actually ""catching my breath"". Luckily,  I was on the phone with my mom who was able to talk me down while I sat on the sidewalk outside of the hospital trying not to pass out.  I sobbed on the phone with her for 20 minutes in the parking lot until I finally felt like I had enough control to drive home.  

&#x200B;

I feel like I need to find some help to get past these issues that I have but I don't even know where to begin.   I have never talked to anyone about this doctor and the thought of going to therapy and talking about my feelings sounds exhausting.",0

I am 20 years old and my (ex) boyfriend is 18. He was my first ever boyfriend and the first person that I ever loved. We were together 2 and a half years. 

Last night he broke up with me so he could focus on school and himself, which I understand completely. I'm just heartbroken. I pretty much had a full blown panic attack when he told me and I've been crying non stop since. I didnt go to school today, and work was rough. I just keep hoping for a text or a call saying he made a mistake and he wants me back. 

Before he left he told me he loved me. I just keep telling myself that if he loved me enough, or as much as I loved him, he would work it out with me. We would push through this. 

I'm thankful to have my parents through this, but I dont have any close friends to talk to. The people I work with have been very supportive, I just wish I had a best friend who's shoulder I could cry on. It sucks cause he was my best friend. He's who I would go to when I was sad and lonely and now I cant do that. And I feel more sad and lonely than I ever have before.

How long between First Date and I Do? and some random thoughts in between,2,douz5n,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/douz5n/how_long_between_first_date_and_i_do_and_some/,11,1572406776.0,"I've been with my new boyfriend for a couple months. we're a good fit. i haven't expressed love in terms of the 3 little words yet, but i'm starting to feel it.  it's not the same as my ex though. that was such a passionate, nerve wracking expression of love i almost passed out. this is more quiet. it sort of dawned on me in a very factual-feeling manner while i was on vacation last week on my own without my BF. i was wishing he was there a lot, seeing and doing things and thinking 'omg, he would LOVE this' and not wanting to sleep alone at night. i guess it feels like a confident love rather than a wild love. is that normal?

i'm not desperate for a mate or something, but i look at him and see just a genuinely good man. he works, he values his ability to provide, but values my ability to provide for myself. he helps with my dog when i need help, and she LOVES him (small miracle), we have a great sex. he's supportive of my medical issues, he doesn't push me harder than i can handle and helps me when i'm not feeling well.  he does so much, and i rarely even ask.  i don't have to, because he WANTS to be there and make it better. 

not many hobbies in common, but we do both like dining, and movies, and we both like nature, which leaves us with date night ideas and individual interests that give our personal lives depth independent of the other person, which i think is healthy. we're on the same page. he's intelligent, a great sparring partner for me. and what gaps there are in my own knowledge chances are he can fill in the blanks so we're balanced in our collective knowledge.  he thinks my sister a generally decent human being, which is more generous than i usually am.

he wants me to reach my goals, and be the person i'm striving to be. he's not the kind of person who would come across some new business idea and drop everything because he wants what he wants without thinking of what would happen if he suddenly lost his income. 

it's not like everything is perfect. he can't cook very much, and his cleaning skills are subpar to my standards. he doesn't place much stock in organization and putting things away because he grew up in a very messy home. i didn't. different standards. i have to follow a special diet. he doesn't. i've got an OCD spectrum disorder, he doesn't. we have a difference in comfort level that i find mildly alarming, but after discussing it he does understand that it's not normal, how he lived growing up and where his comfort level is. and he doesn't mind that mine is higher. and he understands that you can't start with a mess then bring children and pets into it, because they bring their own mess level. his fashion sense is sometimes questionable, and he seriously needs to rethink the long hair, or at least the way he maintains it. 

but he is a good man. i look at him and see a good man first. it's literally the first thing i see. not a good-*looking* man, not the money, the car, the apartment and the stuff, not the level of sophistication. these are all mitigatable. i mean...i'd like to have a kitchen table in there to eat at when he cooks for us both. also it would eat up the empty space in his place...which exists for a table. but it'll get there. besides, negotiating with him is actual negotiating, not arguing. which in my experience is rare.

i'm almost 30 with a fertility unfriendly condition. i don't want to be an old mom or risk not having children at all. he knows this. he's known since we met almost a year ago. in deciding to pursue this it was understood that i was putting my personal goals for family on hold to explore this, and i made it clear that i would not be sitting around for 2-3 years waiting for him to decide if he can live with me, then spend another 2 years planning a wedding, then another year in the honeymoon phase...i just don't have the time. he understands, and says that he's read somewhere that you should know by about 6 months whether you can spend your life with someone or not. 

i don't know if i just feel extra comfortable because we were friends first, or because it feels different from past relationships because it is actually stable, or if i don't really love him like i should, or because i am legitimately confident in this match. but i do love what he does, and who he is. i respect him and appreciate him so much.  it's a good match, on paper and in practice. 

i'd marry him tomorrow if he asked. obviously that won't happen, but in 6 months? who knows. i don't. but if it came to it, would 6 months be too short? he's my best friend. the only person i ever want to go to when things are tough, and the first and last person i want to speak to every day. at the same time, i don't feel this obsessive NEED to be in touch with him on a constant basis, physically or via text or something, and at 2 months i don't know if that's normal. like, is this what loving in a mature adult relationship is like? 

Sorry i'm all over the place, i'm jetalgged, lol. 

TLDR: is 6 months too short to decide if you want to marry someone, even if you're almost 30? i don't feel wildly in love with my boyfriend, obsessively passionate, romance novel level stuff, i just feel...at peace and ease and confident and don't know if that's even how mature love is supposed to feel.",2

Then there are the girls who say, that nothing changed and they have less periods cramps, clear skin and less mood swings.

Does it all come down to taking a mystery pill and hoping that it doesn't screw you up? how should I prepare to evaluate if said pill makes undesirable changes?

Her father is very religious and is obsessed with her virginity (she's not a virgin but he thinks she is). She recently visited her boyfriend (with her mother) who has been living in a different state for work.

I'm uncomfortable with the following behavior from boss: constant work related praise, too many mentions about how great I look for my age (because I workout), ""supportive"" notes he leaves for the day I work by myself (notes are gushy and say things about how he's not going to abandon me), I can never go do things on my own (he lets me take clients by myself, but if I say I'm going to go clean this or that he always tags along), invites me to go on his social media and to call his personal phone on our mutual day off if I want to go hiking. There are daily mentions of us hanging out together outside of work (I owe you dinner, Mr Chu left these coupons for wings we should go, I found a hiking spot by your house we should go, you like music? We should go to this concert). I deflect constantly and every evasive statement I make backfires because he just thinks I'm so cool (his words). At this point, though, I'm interpreting everything in only one way. I do very much think he could simply be socially inept, lonely, and just plain weird. I have seen him behave toward female clients in a way that seems overtly creepy, but I know in those circumstances he's not coming from a creepy, predatory place.

I'm sure this is gonna be a mess. I've got a lot going through my head and I'm not really sure what to do. 

I have been with my boyfriend for just about a year. I love him very much (we were best friends before and I knew him well before we started dating). Recently I have felt that the spark in our relationship is gone, both in bed and in general. This probably has to do with the fact that hes joining the military. But its definitely more than that. 

I know the best thing to do would be to talk to him about how I'm feeling and work through this but that isnt an option. He's in bootcamp right now and I wont be able to communicate with anything but letters for the next 3 months. I obviously dont want to wait 3 months to talk and let things fester inside me and I know that most of it just stems from my anxietys. But there are real things I want to discuss. 

I'm just a mess and I miss him more than anything and it hurts like hell. 
I dont really know what I'm looking for here, I just needed to let some of it out. If anyone has any experience with military or really any advice on how to talk about sensitive subjects with an s.o., that would be great. 

Edit: thanks for the insight. 
Thankfully he's in as a mechanic, not infantry. But I'm still worried as hell about him.

I'm on my period right now and I'm super low-energy and I'm finding it hard to put together sentences (though this could be the placebo/nocebo effect since I expect myself to have low verbal intelligence during my period). I just want to know whether it's wiser to schedule an essay exam for the follicular phase or ovulation or post-ovulation. Any input is appreciated and anything with scientific evidence to back it up is especially appreciated!,1

I agreed to just pay for everything we owed together so he would sign the divorce papers so I could be rid of him. Turns out, one of the things we owe is $5,000 and I can't swing that. He says if I don't pay it by Halloween, he will take me to court.

I've already paid thousands of dollars paying off his bike, what we owed old apartment complexes, what we owed Comcast and I took on the car payments. I also paid to file for divorce.

He said he won't sign the divorce papers unless I pay for everything.

He leaves scary voicemails, emails me horrible things, and the other day I answered a blocked number and it was him. I immediately started shaking. 

I'm done letting him take control over me.

I'm going to fucking make him pay.",59

But out where I live, dogs are valued more. Cats are mostly seen as a nuisance. People will try to hit cats with their cars. I can't imagine anyone ever trying to hit a dog with their car.

Oh you killed a cat that didn't belong to anyone? No  big deal. Someone's pet cat? Now that's sad but still not a tragedy. And it's only sad because of its connection to someone else, not because it had a life or value of its own.

Dog hit by a car? Animal abuse! Murder! What a horrible person!

It's a completely different reaction. 

And I'm not saying dogs or cats are better. I love both. In fact I pretty much love all animals. I'm an animal lover through and through. 

But I relate to cats for a lot of reasons. Their independence, their quirky personalities, their quiet, constant companionship. And on some level, I think I can relate to being something of a second-class citizen. I have value as someone's sister, daughter, wife. But not as a woman. Not as a person.

Anyway just a thought. I might be way off base and thinking about this way too hard, but it was on my mind today so I thought I'd share.",0
Dear Mom,0,dox70w,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dox70w/dear_mom/,0,1572415811.0,"  

Dear Mom,

&#x200B;

You know who I am.

I am a Civil Engineering student. 

I have an associate degree in Civil Engineering Technology. 

I have a good job.

I am the middle child of five. Two older sisters, one younger sister, and the youngest is my brother.

I would not trade them for the world.

I have a boyfriend, and a car, and I rent a duplex on a lake.

I am 22 years old.

I am young.

I am successful.

I am not a very good Catholic.

But do you know me?

&#x200B;

I do not know why I go to school.

I do not like it.

I am happy, none the less.

I have made a lot of new friends this year. 

I am learning to make human connections with everyone I meet, even overcoming language barriers, but this is making watching the news harder and harder for me.

I am in love. 

I am almost certain I will be engaged by the end of the year, although I know I have said that before.

I have dreams.

I want a hot tub in a mudroom, with all my plants surrounding it, and with a mini bar next to it, facing a large tv mounted on the wall. 

I want to be married to my boyfriend and to have children that grow up happy like I did.

I want them to grow up to be good, kind, self-sufficient people.

I want my kids to be like yours.  (no, I am not pregnant)

Happy.

Did you know all that?

&#x200B;

I have questions. 

I know who you are, but I do not know you.

I have seen you.

I have felt you.

In my anger, in my sadness, in my hatred.

This is when I see you in me.

But that is not how I know you.

How should I know you?

You are married to my father.

You are my mother

a grandmother

a wife

my coach

a sales woman

a daughter

a friend

a Catholic

You are so many things.

But that is not how you know a person.

I do not know your first love.

I do not know your childhood.

What did you want?

What do you want?

What are your dreams?

Have any come true?

Were they what you expected?

Do you still hold on to them?

Are you looking for new ones?

&#x200B;

Between all the happy days as a kid I remember moments.

Moments when just a look from you could make me dissolve completely.

Moments when I felt like I could not talk to you because you were going to judge me instead of hear me.

I remember our fights.

I remember when I wanted to say, “I hate you.”

You read those words as if I had them tattooed across my forehead. 

You egged me on to say it out loud.

I knew you could brush that off. Just a teenager talking shit.

That’s why I said, “I don’t hate you, but I am losing my respect for you.”

I don’t remember what that fight was about.

I think that is the meanest thing I have ever said to anyone, but it was true at the time.

&#x200B;

I did not know your struggles.

I do not know your struggles, yet one by one, they are becoming mine. 

They become my sisters’ and my brother’s.

Not because you give them to us, but because adulthood does.

Why do I see you when I see hot red, or feel dark, dark blue?

Did you make your children’s yellows your own?

Is that why I couldn't see them?

Or did your yellow get blotted out by some darker color?

Was I just oblivious?

&#x200B;

You gave me everything I needed to succeed.

Everything even when I could not see it.

Everything even when I did not appreciate it.

Everything even at the expense of yourself.

Maybe that’s why I felt like that was the one thing you were not giving me.

You.

&#x200B;

I do not know you, but I know you have love for me.

I did not always feel it then, I did not understand.

I am learning to recognize it more and more every day.

&#x200B;

I want to know you.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

With love,

Your Daughter",0

So there’s no chance of me possibly getting laid in the near future. And even if there was a possibility, I’ve always thought that if I have sex with someone, that person better be fine with my forest because there was no way I’d be shaving.

Except a little under two hours ago I suddenly got an urge to experience what it’s like to have a shaved vagina.

So, I hopped into the shower and got to work. I had no clue what I was doing, and was just doing my best to carefully maneuver around the important bits and get rid of all the hair. It... did not go to plan, of course. In hindsight, I probably should’ve tried to cut off the majority of the hair beforehand because there was A LOT of hair. My razor was clogged up constantly and I had to clean it out more times than I could count, which caused the (luckily) only cut I got on my thumb.

However, my constant cleaning of the razor was not able to save it. The blades became dull very quickly, and near the end of the process I was desperately trying to get rid of the last bits of hair or to atleast get rid of enough that my vagina didn’t look like a goatee. I had started to freak out and worry if my dad would get angry for me taking so long in the shower (he ended up not even noticing, or atleast he did not ask me about it). 

After what felt like an eternity trying to shave off those last bits of hair, I ended up giving up with the very few short pieces in the back. I rinsed the area off, hopped out of the shower, and quickly went to my room so I can look at myself in the mirror. It felt weird not seeing my forest, and honestly I miss it already. I’m going to stick with my preference of having an unshaven vagina in the future.",14

It's embarassing to talk about because at it's core what i think it is is this gnawing voice saying my life is over because im ""old""

Embarassing because on some level i can acknowledge how absurd it is to consider 32 ""old"" and to consider my life over primarily because my ""looks are fading"" according to media. But here it is, it's in my head, brainwashed or not, and it's unshakeable and bringing me down every day so i need to talk about it. 

It feels like life is so short. For everyone. But for women it's as though life is only like ten years (from age 20-30). Thats the window where you have to acomplish everything, enjoy your very short romantic life, establish your career, network and build friendships. And then get settled. And then it's over. And men and young women act like you are now a joke just because youre ""old"". And thats where i am now. Lovely husand. Wonderful child. But fucking now what, for me. I just feel like life is over. Ive rerouted my brain to focus on my son and help him build his life, but whem i try to focus on myself it's like eh why bother life is over.

Is this typical for women transitioning in to their 30s? I feel like this is a mid life crisis or something. My son is 3 so it's not PPD. I have no history of mental illness or depression. But turning 30 was like flicking a switch and for years it's like what is the point of life? What do you do after youth?

Was this rape?,4,dolniu,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dolniu/was_this_rape/,19,1572356891.0,"Hi everyone! I am in a conflicting situation but I do kindly ask not to receive judgement for what I’m about to say. It is difficult for me to type this and nobody in my life knows about this. 

When I was 20 I was still a virgin. A man in my University whom I considered a friend kept asking me to watch a movie with him throughout first year. In the summer of 2017, I have decided to go and hang out with him. He kissed me and my top cane off soon after. A part of me was intrigued and curious about sex but I was pretty anxious about it (especially due to my religion). A few weeks later I ended up at his place again. This time things went even further and he was the first man to ever see me fully naked. I was apprehensive and self conscious about my body. He was very fit and muscular while I was a bit chubby. 

I told him I didn’t want to have sex, that I am saving that for my husband. I told him he can finger me instead. He asked me if I was sure, that I wouldn’t be a virgin anymore. I didn’t understand why he thought that putting a finger inside would make me loose my virginity. After a while, when he was on top of me during that time, I felt something push its way into me. I had no idea what it was, I thought it was his fingers but it turns out that it was not. He pushed his penis into me but didn’t thrust. Instead he pulled back out. 

He commented during that night that I was uncomfortable. I felt very uncomfortable, things were moving way too fast for me. 

A few weeks after that I came over to his house again. This time I made sure we discussed barriers on Snapchat and I thought we were clear on only doing oral. Well, things kept moving a bit too much again. He went on top of me and pushed himself in. I pushed him on his chest and said “I said no sex”. 

Well later on during that night, he told me to go on all fours on the bed. I did what he said but I told him sternly “no anal” in case he thought that would be okay like our last hang out. I assumed he would either go down on me or finger me or something but I didn’t expect him to start fucking me. He saw I was tense or something because he kept whispering to me “it’s okay shh it’s okay”.

I was taken by surprise. I was pushed down onto my stomach and I felt a huge lump in my throat start to form. I could feel my nose tingle and I tears came. I forced myself to stop before he noticed and I decided to focus entirely on how it feels. That’s what I did. I focused on the feeling and later on did have an orgasm. 

I avoided him after that and he kept trying to message me. A few months later we had a discussion about that and how I didn’t think it was okay. Things were getting heated and he asked me what I was trying to say (at this point I was dancing around the word rape). I back peddled and asked him to apologize and he said “I am sorry that you feel that way” or something around those lines. 

Throughout the year I wanted him to call me his girlfriend or at least want to date me. I have waited and kept in touch with him. We had a few arguments about why he kept wanting to hang out with me and have sex with me while also clearly going out with other girls (taking this girl out for a walk on the board walk and then have take her out for breakfast). Even typing that makes me hurt. 

Least to say, he’s my boyfriend now. He does and did take good care of me. He’s protective of me and doesn’t repeatedly ask me for a blowjob if I don’t want to give it to him like he did in 2017. He calls me sweetie and his baby. He told me he wants to see where I am going to go in life and how he wants to be a part of it. Currently he’s in Egypt, working in his family business until his father comes back from travels.

At the same time I am interested in other men around me here. None of my friends are aware I am dating him. My close friend knows about what he did so I don’t plan on telling her. But I guess I just wanted to ask, was this rape? Or was I just too scared about loosing my virginity and I now regret it? It’s 2019 and I think it was some kind of misunderstanding, he drove two hours to come see me and two hours back before. He thinks like me in regards to women and sexual assault issues. I just need clarification. I feel so guilty. I want to be with him, the thought of him being with another woman upsets me greatly and makes me feel like a used paper. 

This other guy I talk to my friends about (we never went out or anything) is different. But I like my boyfriend’s skin, the feel of his arms, his kisses, his caring heart, his sense of humour; I love the way he fits into me. We had sex so many times together, I can’t imagine another man. I just don’t even know what I am saying anymore but please can someone give me some kind of clarity. That’s all I am asking.",4

Pretty much every time I'm in public alone, I get some creepy dude getting in my personal space, making gross comments, and not taking no for an answer.

Today, I made a short road trip to a State Park by myself. For the first 10 minutes it felt empowering and fun to be outdoors, on my own terms. I was planning on going on a hike, taking in some views, and hanging around for the golden hour.

But within 10 minutes of me being in the park, getting sunscreen and a water bottle out of my car, a group of loud dudes comes barreling around the corner and stops right at my car. One of them shouts at me asking for a picture with them. I just stare at them and say ""Why?"" Apparently they weren't expecting that so the yelling guy stutters and then comes up with ""why, just look at you!"" And they're all fucking staring at me and I'm feeling uncomfortable. Alone. On a hill. Outnumbered. From out of town. I tell them ""Nah"" and flip my hand at them telling them to go on their way and they do. I was wearing shorts and a t-shirt. No make-up, ready for a hike. And now I'm feeling unsafe, and keep checking around every corner, hoping to avoid the group. I cut my hike short and don't stay for the sunset. 

Just look at me? What? The hell does that even mean? I look like an average young human woman so therefore I deserve to be catcalled? Like I'd be flattered? Alone, away from other people, about to hike out by myself? Like I'm fucking prey.

Men make me feel like this almost every day. Especially when I'm alone. Even when I'm with friends. I was groped in a bar a few weeks ago while out with friends. I think I'm still shaken up by that. Sorry if this got kind of ranty I just needed to word vomit for a minute. Thanks for listening.


TL;DR I go out for a hike, get cat called by some dudes, who suggest that something about the way I look makes it okay. They made me uncomfortable, nervous, and feel unsafe.

(And I experienced kind of neutral/generally ungratifying sex with the same partners, when I'm feeling great about myself.)

I think this has basically both started relationships (I enter them with low mental health but high sex drive and enjoyment) and ended them (they don't like when I'm high mental health, but not wanting/enjoying sex). Does this happen to anyone else?",47

"When I was 17, I was raped. Since then, I haven't been able to have any sort of consensual sexual experience out of fear and anger over what happened",9,doi13m,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/doi13m/when_i_was_17_i_was_raped_since_then_i_havent/,4,1572337112.0,"I was 17 and I was raped by a member of my high schools' baseball team. It was shortly after school had ended for the day and I was getting my things to leave from my locker when one of the baseball team players came up to me and actually tried to ask me out. I was flattered of course but politely declined as I just wasn't looking to be in a relationship. He almost immediately became angry and aggressive, calling me a bitch for being mean to him after he complimented me. I immediately turned and started to walk away when he forcefully grabbed my arm and almost broke it as he pulled me into a locker room. All the while I'm shouting and screaming at the top of my lungs yet no one comes. He punched and slapped me multiple times to get me to be quiet and nearly broke my nose. 

He then threw me into a set of lockers and tied my hands behind my back with his belt and removed my shorts and underwear and penetrated me anally. I think it only lasted for a few minutes before I think the custodian burst in and pulled him away and threw him into a wall. I got dressed and quickly ran out crying. In the end, the police came to the school and I called my parents and told them what happened. The kid who raped me was promptly arrested and eventually expelled from the school. The only good thing to come out of all this is that my parents were supportive through it all as were my friends. 

But still, all these years later (I'm 23 now), I can't even go the distance and engage in consensual sex without getting that horrible image in my head again. I just can't. It's hard for me to even masturbate and I only do so when I can't hold it in anymore. And even that makes me bawl my eyes out because I get reminded of what happened. I even once went on a date with a genuinely nice and cute guy in college and we headed back to his place and as soon as I fell into that ""lust mode"" where I thought I genuinely wanted to have sex with him, that memory came back and I apologized and quickly left. 

I even went to a therapist but that didn't help much at all. I genuinely don't know what to do.",9

Before you send condolences though we were never close. My mother was more of a stranger to me then anything.

She was an alcoholic, a drug addict, a narcissist, manipulative and a gold digger. I have nothing kind to say about her. When I was 8 she abandoned me with my amazing father and he raised me. It was the best and maybe only good thing she ever did for me. He is the only parent I acknowledge.

I accepted that I would never have a relationship with my mother when I was 16. But even knowing that my mother was not someone who would ever really love me I had always held out some hope somewhere that she would realize what she had done to me, realize what she threw away and try to apologize. Try and build a relationship.

She did try to come back into my life recently but it wasn't to apologize, it was to manipulate and demand and minimize and deflect and literally blame me for being born. It wasn't the contact I was hoping to have with her. I wrote her off told her I was done with her. The last thing I ever said to her was telling her to crawl back into the dumpster fire she crawled out of. I told her she could drink herself to death for all I cared. That is exactly what she did. She drank herself to death.

When I first heard the news I didnt feel anything. I didnt really care to be honest. In the last almost 15 years now since she left me I can count the amount of times I saw her on 1 hand. My mother to me was a stranger, an occasional drunk voice over the phone, a facebook photo, an empty seat at my graduation ceremonies. Now though I realize I am mourning. I am mourning not the woman I knew but the mother I never had. The mother I always wanted to have, the mother I will now never have.",9

Even after I had broken up with him, he still would use me sexually and guilt trip me into giving him what he wanted. Finally, one day, I had decided I had enough and I cut off contact with him and reached out to people I hadn't talked to in months.
I went back to try and rebuild my old friendships, only to find that he had been lying to all of them and spreading rumors about me.

He held me down,  choked me with his forearm, and when I snapped out of it and started fighting back,  I caught his elbow to my eye. I got him out of my house and called the police.  They didn't even go after him.  This was Friday. I had an officer show up the next day,  almost 12 hours later when I wasn't home. He left a business card in my door. 

I decided that I'm sick of being afraid of a 5'4 130lb guy. I could whip his ass myself if he tried, not to toot my horn but I did a little kickboxing when I was younger. But I can't afford to get into any legal trouble,  and he'd told me time and time again the police wouldn't help me- and that was obviously the case.  So I decided to protect myself. I went to our local newspaper first and spoke to a journalist, giving him copies of all of my evidence. I didn't want the police to take my phone to, wipe it,  or something ridiculous. 

The journalist gave me the number of a lawyer who works against the police corruption in this county. He also sent a direct message to the lieutenant, informing him I was coming. I'm so grateful to him. He's keeping my story anonymous and helping me with resources to deal with this guy.  I can't even call him a man,  it makes my stomach turn thinking about it. 

I'm vindicated today.  I'm done being scared.  Fuck the corruption, fuck the assholes who protect guys like this,  and mostly.... fuck him.  He's a slimy bastard who won't slip through the cracks this time- we're holding him accountable.  I hope that I prevent just one woman from the shit he's put me though. It'd be enough.

School has been really hard lately. I’m going to school for engineering at one of the top schools , but I’m struggling. They fail a lot of people and my second semester I failed one of the hardest classes. I know that’s normal and that it’s fine to fail a class, but it feels like I’m just trying to get by and get a passing grade, rather than so well and strive for success. At this school, a lot of people fail at least one class. I put a higher amount of pressure on myself because I feel as if I need to prove women are just as capable as men in this field. 

The reason this is such a big deal for me is because a lot of my exes told me all I was good for was becoming a teacher or working with kids. They said I shouldn’t try to become successful because women shouldn’t be in STEM fields, they should be stay at home moms or at least find a career path “suited towards women”. They said I couldn’t be more successful than them. It would wreck their image. 

I said f you, I’m going to do what I want and show other girls they can do it too. I feel like I’m letting myself and other young women fighting for the same thing down. I want to prove them wrong.

The streets themselves were packed, so the inside of each bar was standing room only. I couldn’t move without bumping into someone. Not even five minutes passed before some guy slapped my ass as I was waiting in line to get a drink. He scurried away before I even had time to turn around. Not the greatest start to my night. 

We stayed for about an hour (we somehow managed to find a seat) and when we got up to leave, I know that I looked exhausted, both emotionally and physically. I don’t do crowds, and I was still upset from what had happened earlier. I just wanted out. I started heading toward the door, my husband behind me. 

I was attempting to politely push my way through the mass of costumed bodies when I saw you. You were with your friend, also trying to leave. You looked at me and smiled, and you said something (although it was far too loud in the bar for me to hear) and you grabbed my hand. You held my hand tight and helped pull me through the crowd, looking back every once in a while to make sure I was still okay. You held on until we had made it outside the bar and past the entrance, where people were lining up. Then you and your friend kept walking, and I let go of your hand. I didn’t even get a chance to thank you. 

So to the girl who grabbed my hand at the bar...thank you. You saw another girl struggling and offered your hand without a second thought, and I love and appreciate you for it.

I argued back, saying that that was how most of my partners and I came to date--in almost each case, it was after I had just gone through a toxic breakup or had a family death (or when my stepfather was undergoing emergency surgery for cancer). I said I hadn't felt like it was predatory at the time. My friends all looked at me then, like, ""oh, sweetheart."" The ones who began relationships with me in this way ended up being either outright abusive or toxic later on, but maybe that's just my story--maybe that doesn't always happen.

So I guess I'd just like to hear all of your opinions on if you think going after someone when they're emotionally vulnerable is ever acceptable? I had never heard someone say it wasn't okay until this weekend, and it struck me hard.

I don’t think I will ever be able to move on :(,8,do9pui,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/do9pui/i_dont_think_i_will_ever_be_able_to_move_on/,47,1572302323.0,"Tl;dr: I feel as though I (24F) will never get over my ex boyfriend (27M). We were together for 2 years. 

I keep going back and forth in my head and it’s been 4 months since we split up. 

I loved this guy with all my heart, I gave him everything, which is what I feel contributed to us breaking up, I gave him too much of my life and felt resentment when he couldn’t give me the same back. I don’t think I’ll ever meet anyone as funny, charming, handsome, and lovely as him. 

The break up was both our faults. We met too close after his previous relationship of 7 yrs ended. He told me he had a 10 month gap between but when we broke up he told me this was in fact only 2 months :(.  I distinctively remember feeling like he was a bit withdrawn at the beginning of our relationship and he used to always reassure me and told me to be patient with him and to stick by him.

About a year into our relationship he compared me to his ex girlfriend. He said he was only giving me 50/60% and that his relationship with his ex was fire and that he wanted to take her around the world and hadn’t felt like that with me, and that he sometimes thought I needed to be with a loser boyfriend, but then said I’m the prettiest and most caring girl he’s ever been with. He said I would be shocked if I could see how he was with his ex girlfriend. When I said that we should probably break up he said he really wanted to try and work on things as he wanted to give me more and so I agreed.

As a result of everything, in the following months I became quite insecure. I subconsciously felt as though I had something to prove and forgot who I was a person. I guess I lost myself, and was no longer doing things that made me happy in the past and was so focused on my job, exams and him.

At the time it felt like everything was somehow my fault. He once shouted at me when I initiated sex and literally said “I’ve had the most stressful day at work, all I want to do is relax and not stress that my girlfriend is grabbing my dick every 2 seconds”. He apologised after he realised how this upset me. It really shocked me because I didn’t realise I was making him feel uncomfortable and it wasn’t like we were even having sex that much. Out of my ex boyfriends, he’s wanted sex the least and I guess I always wondered why, if I ever brought it up he got annoyed and said that I’m going to ruin our relationship over sex which isn’t even important when looking for a life partner. He then told me he’d want it more if I initiated less and played more hard to get. It was honestly very confusing.

I work in the financial district and my exams were very tough, and I think the stress got the better of me and I seemed a bit sad at times / grumpy, although I was still prioritising him in my life. He didn’t like me sad and would say he felt like he was walking on egg shells around me which would make me feel like I would need to be switch on when I was with him. 

I guess since he compared me to his ex girlfriend, I became a lot more aware of what I was doing in the relationship vs what he was doing. I started venting a lot to friends, and I was often scared to communicate this insecurity of mine in fear he would break up with me. It was never that I didn’t trust him, but I didn’t trust our relationship lasting if that makes sense. I found it difficult to think too far into the future because I felt he would break up with me. A week before we broke up I remember stupidly texting him and asking what his views on cheating were as I guess I felt a bit nervous that he was going on a lads work holiday and I felt as though things were off between us. I have beat myself up about that text over and over, because I think that’s what made him decide to not be with me anymore.

When we broke up he said he had tried to make things work and I was very confused on what he had actually done to try. But looking back, I know he did try, he tried to be patient with me, but things were just getting worse for me in my head with feeling like I wasn't good enough. I used to look at other couples and wish that my boyfriend acted like that with me. I feel like I sabotaged the relationship in my head, and I know for a fact I will never meet someone who makes me laugh as much as he did. He was so incredibly charming, handsome and had a great personality :(. 

I tried to meet up for a coffee with him a few weeks back but he forgot and made other plans. I was really hurt by this because I couldn’t think how he would forget he was meeting up with me. I had asked him which days suited him too so I just couldn’t understand it :(. He asked if we could reschedule but I’m not sure if there is any point. I don’t want to feel this hurt anymore. 

I keep blaming myself because I feel as though when i was with him, I was no longer living in the present and focused too much on what happened in the past. He’s my one that got away.

I moved with bf when he started grad school. I’ve got an amazing job now, and it’s genuinely been great. I’m still trying to find friends, hence this vent haha 
I’ll be talking to him about all this, I legit just need to word vomit do I do t feel alone or so others can tell me I’m overthinking stuff. 

So. Since we’ve moved, I’ve taken on most of the household duties. Outside of taking out the trash, and him doing his laundry I tend to do everything. Deep cleaning, washing dishes, cooking, daily cleaning, etc. Etc. I don’t mind this, because I know he’s crazy stressed and this helps him. And gives us more us time.

However. I have a 3hour or so commute each day. After which, I come home and make dinner. And then we eat. I’m tired of this. Especially since half the time I come home, after working, he’s on the computer gaming (which is fair, he’s a lil stress ball rn). It just irritates me and I really need it not to. I’m fixing this by starting to use the crock pot. But still. It’s frustrating when I’m doing chores and he’s gaming. Even though he’s been working hard. I’m also tired of caring for him. I love it, but sometimes I just get so tired and don’t want to hear about his studio. Which is honestly so selfish of me. 

Then, we haven’t had sex in over a month. I haven’t pushed it, because I know he’s been stressed, or I’ve been. I’ve told him numerous times to not worry about it, that we still cuddle and we’re affectionate so it’s okay. And I’m genuinely okay with it. I get it. But, we were planning on sex this weekend. He took me out to a cute picnic since he had time this weekend and it was lovely. I even tried doing stuff outdoors which he likes. But nada. Same thing later that night. But come Sunday night, after dinner, when he came home from studio, he had been hinting at it. At this point, my period cramps are bad so now I’m backing out. He says well do later tonight, and he’ll wake me up if I fall asleep. He goes to game, I get ready for bed. I’m crampy. He wakes me up, and I try to be into it, but I’m not. Plus I need to get up early for work. Which I feel awful about. And it hurts too, even after a bit so I ask him to stop. And we go back to bed. And now I just feel so guilty. I wrote him a cute note this morning and made sure to cuddle him, but yeah. 

I just feel guilty, and whenever I get annoyed that I’m doing everything even though he’s stressed, I start feeling awful for feeling that way.

It’s starting to make me sad seeing people have children and families, because my decisions up until this point haven’t really left me the opportunity.  I didn’t even think about this stuff until fairly recently.  I never really thought this is something I would ever feel, and I never sought marriage and children and now I’m in a relationship with someone who doesn’t really seem to care to do any of that.  I don’t want to leave him, either.  I don’t really know what to do about all of this but these sorts of thoughts have been creeping up on me and it’s upsetting to think that it might not happen",1

I had my headphones in so I tried to pretend like I couldn’t hear him, but he sat down beside me. I was kinda weirded out but i didn’t want to seem over dramatic and get up and leave which I really regret now. He started off with normal chit chat (“How was your day? This rain really sucks.”, etc.) then shifted gears and asked if I wanted to go on a date. I lied and said I had a boyfriend, hoping that would make him back off,  but he said he didn’t care about that. I told him I’m waiting on my boyfriend and that he’s on his way but he said that’s plenty of time to have sex. I got up to leave and he grabbed my hand and made me sit back down and said, “I’m going to fuck you hard tonight. I see that look in your eyes. You want to too. I have a humongous cock and you won’t be able to walk.” 

Right after he said that, a woman walked past. I looked at her, hoping that she’d somehow see that I wanted out of the situation, but obviously she couldn’t tell. I don’t know why I didn’t yell or call out. I know it’s stupid, but I guess I didn’t want to seem rude. A few more people walked past and looked at us, but since I didn’t say anything, they didn’t know. At that point I started to zone out a little. He grabbed a handful of his dick through his pants and went, “I’ll tear you in two with this.” He said some more stuff like that but I just tried to stop listening. Finally, a pair of security guards walked past since the mall was officially closed and I guess that freaked him out and he let go of my hand and I just ran. 

I know nothing really happened physically and it’s not even a big deal, but it really freaked me out for some reason and I just wanted to get it off my chest.

EDIT: Thank you so much for the kind words and support, everyone! I was feeling sort of defeated after the ordeal, but reading everyone’s comments and messages made me feel a lot better. I did go back to the mall to report it and the security guards told me someone else also reported it last night. They took down my contact information and said they’d call if anything came up about who he was (because the camera footage didn’t get a good view of his face). My city’s police department isn’t necessarily the greatest at looking into reports without hard evidence so I’m waiting on some so they’ll actually take me seriously.

Diva cup questions,0,doj3hj,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/doj3hj/diva_cup_questions/,3,1572342244.0,"Hello ladies. 

I switched last period to the cup and am finding it surprisingly easy and helpful on my menstrual journey. I have some questions perhaps some of you could answer. 

- How often should you boil it? I boiled it right when I bought it and in between periods rinse it with soap and water. Boiling it each time doesn’t seem necessary. Anything I don’t know? 

- I bleed quite a lot and use the larger model. I remove the cup by coming into a squat and reaching in to break the seal. Then I wiggle it out from the bottom. This is relatively painless but a lot of blood spills over when I tug it out of my vagina. I usually remove it in the bathtub so this isn’t a problem. But I’m concerned about travelling or being in public with this. If I did it over the toilet I think there would be a lot of spillage. What have been your experiences? Could my technique be refined?

How can I ask my boyfriend to masturbate quietly without shaming him?,0,doi37m,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/doi37m/how_can_i_ask_my_boyfriend_to_masturbate_quietly/,22,1572337364.0,"Hi everyone,

This is my throwaway account because I worry someone will be able to tell who I am on my primary account. I hope it’s okay I post this here, I’m really just looking to hear from others that I have a valid reason to bring up such an awkward, uncomfortable topic. I have an extremely tough time voicing my feelings and usually choose to not say anything at all which often blows up in my face. Not looking for relationship advice, more just checking in with people outside the situation that I have a reason to say something?

So for context, my boyfriend and I started off as roommates. We have been together for about 1 1/2 years now but we still use our separate bedrooms. I am a very light sleeper and my boyfriend suffers from insomnia. We are also just plain used to going to bed in our own rooms at this point so it’s also habit. For the most part, I honestly see our sleeping situation as a plus. We get space to ourselves, we don’t have to worry about stealing blankets, etc. it’s worked out quite well so far. 

Lately, I have been waking up because I hear him wake up and masturbate in the middle of the night. We are pretty open about the fact that we both masturbate and I absolutely do not mind that he does. Sometimes I’ll lightheartedly comment like, “oh why didn’t you just come wake me up so I could join you?” But I’m not offended by the fact that he does it. It seems like lately though he has gotten louder during and it is happening more frequently. 

In the whole time we’ve lived together I have never really heard him except on rare occasions. Now every time he does, I can hear him loudly moaning through the wall and it wakes me up. Not just wakes me up, but triggers this insane adrenaline rush in me to where my heart is pounding, my stomach is churning, and I get flushed. Like I’ve just been jolted awake by a nightmare. 

Even though this is the man I love and trust, I think it’s triggering the same feelings I’ve had every time I’ve been assaulted or had someone masturbate to me in public. Maybe because I can only hear him, not see him? As you can imagine, it’s really difficult to calm back down and go back to sleep after this. It’s been going on like this every couple days or so for weeks and now it’s to the point where if I even hear him shift in bed it sets my heart racing in preparation for what’s maybe to come. I hear him moaning in my head during lulls at work and I am grossed out all over again. It’s weird to say but it’s a little traumatizing! 

My boyfriend is a very sensitive soul (which I love him for) so I’d like to tread lightly and frame my request with my reasoning behind it. I do not want him to feel ashamed of masturbating. I’m not looking for him to stop the act itself. I don’t want him to be embarrassed and honestly I don’t want him to think I’m trying to be controlling, but I’d really like to ask him to be more quiet if he’s going to do it in the middle of the night and not include me in the fun. Am I a jerk for thinking this way? 

Part of me thinks I shouldn’t say anything and should just start wearing my earplugs to bed, but they aren’t very comfortable and I don’t necessarily think it’s unreasonable of me to ask him to keep his moaning quiet while I’m trying to sleep.",0

Ok, I'm overweight and pretty tom-boyish, and though certain types of guys find my down to earthness appealing, it's better for friendly conversations with guys, and generally yields me few dates and more guy friends/acquaintances. I got to talking about comic books with this barista who has retired to this job due a construction injury (similar to an injury my dad got) and we both had a good time talking MCU changes vs. comic universe while waiting in line in between him taking customers. I was the last in line, and the store was empty besides a woman on her laptop and us by the time he got to making my coffee. It was about 13ish min. of in and out conversation with him because he was also taking orders, and though I thought it was just friendly time passing chit-chat, he thought it was an invitation. 

Really he reminded me of my dad (mid 50s to early 60s) and was probably a bit older than my dad, and I got absolutely NO vibes that he would be attracted to me until that store was just us and the one woman with headphones. By the time it's really just us in the store, his demeanor 180ed and he was asking for my number and to take me out to the next big marvel movie. Of course he's taking his sweet time making my drink while I try swerve his intentions back to the friendly-stranger zone. I really did try to be polite with him and clearly decline, but the more I decline the longer he takes to make my drink. He kept laughing off my declines and making jokes like ""are you sure, I'm experienced and could give you a good time!""  and the jokes got more sexual, especially about how ""he's had time to learn how to please a lady"". When I started looking a bit offended (honestly should have told him I'd report him at this point but I'm just too polite) he backtracked about how he was ""just kidding and messing around"". 

I essentially ordered a black coffee that he drops 2 cream into and it should have taken him less than a minute to pour, but he kept putzing around wiping counters and shit while he ""brewed me a fresh pot"" (He didn't btw, he was stalling). Because of that, I was stuck until he made my coffee after I paid for about 5 minutes ""until the new pot it done"" which didn't exist. By the time he's quieter and I thought the situation was clear between us, he finally gives me my drink, but he acts like he's going to give it and pulls it back with a joke about how he'll give it to me if he gets my number. He does this twice, playing the pull back the hand game when I attempt to grab my drink and he laughs it off like playing the fake high-five with a middle schooler. I'm getting pissed and make quick pleading eye contact with the middle aged headphone lady. She picks up that shit's amiss and gets up with a hand on my shoulder while grabbing napkins and asks ""is there a problem sweetie?"" in that sharp customer service voice and this dude changes his demeanor so quick and gives me my drink without issue, eyes down in some type of shame.  

I'm reporting your ass Michael, your a predatory piece of shit trying to play it off with humor. 

Thank you headphone lady for noticing this and having the confidence to stand up when I didn't have the guts or social skills at that moment.",206
Not feeling like myself after IUD insertion,0,dohkei,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dohkei/not_feeling_like_myself_after_iud_insertion/,1,1572334909.0,"Was on and off of birth control pills from age 15-19, then off of birth control completely, and I'm now 21 and had my IUD inserted a few weeks ago. I get a lot of weird anxiety surrounding medical things, so the whole process was pretty stressful and at times emotional for me, but aside from the cramping, felt fine the first week.

Since then, my anxiety (which I've had pretty under control for a year or so, and has since been pretty situational/easier to defuse) has spiked and become totally random. I've been seeing a guy for 5 months and previously felt zero insecurity in the relationship and knew that he was super attracted to me and felt lucky to be with me, but since the IUD I keep having intrusive thoughts that I can't seem to escape, like if he compliments my butt my mind will ignore that and immediately warp it into ""he wishes your boobs were bigger"" - it's especially weird because I consider myself above-average attractive and have always had a pretty healthy relationship with myself/my self esteem, especially in adulthood, and this insecurity only seems to come up surrounding him specifically and whether I'm good enough, if he'd prefer if I looked different in some way, if it comes to his attention during sex, etc. If we're fooling around my brain will randomly be flooded with these thoughts and I'll literally be on the verge of tears even though in reality he's like obsessed with me. It spirals into thinking about men as a whole, which I do anyway, but the journey from point A (the guy that I'm seeing earnestly telling me I look beautiful) to point B (sobbing about harvey weinstein in that comedy club this week) is.... a lot for me. I've generally just been randomly crying a lot, which is new for me. I was diagnosed with depression when I was a kid and have had a couple of episodes, but I'm hoping once my body adjusts to the hormones it'll subside?

A very unpleasant memory from my childhood resurfaced this morning and it’s weighing heavily on my mind.,26,do4qvj,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/do4qvj/a_very_unpleasant_memory_from_my_childhood/,12,1572270562.0,"I don’t know if this is the right sub to post this in, but this weekend I was doing some writing for my one-woman play, as well as a bit of journaling, and I don’t know how, but I had a particularly upsetting memory from when I was in elementary school.

For context, I have Aspergers, and my condition made me an easy target for all kinds of bullying and cruelty my whole life. I’ve never had good social skills, so people usually took advantage of me.

When I was in second grade, I had a crush on a classmate, let’s call him Nick. Somehow a group of snooty little princesses found out, and one day during indoor recess, these girls pinned Nick down to the beanbag chair, dragged me to him and forced me to kiss him. I didn’t want to kiss him because I didn’t want to get in trouble with the teacher, but these girls wouldn’t let me go, so I kissed him on the face. And of course, being the American public school system, I got in trouble but my tormentors got off scot-free.

I can’t imagine what Nick (or any other boy I ever crushed on) must have been thinking. Maybe something like “Of all the girls in the second grade that could like me, why’d it have to be the weird special ed kid?”

This incident happened five years before I was sexually assaulted at summer camp and the counselors dismissed it as me overreacting. It also wouldn’t be the last time that mean girls would find out about a crush and embarrass me about it. Eventually I learned to just stop having crushes, let alone tell anyone about them.

Today, I am a virgin at 25. I’ve never been in a relationship, never kissed. I had a couple experiences but they ended with me freaking out and leaving because they held my hand or expressed interest in kissing or sex, and I believe both the beanbag chair incident and getting assaulted at camp have contributed in some way to my fears of intimacy and vulnerability.

I’m seeing a therapist regularly and finding healing in writing, but I just want to overcome my past so I can learn to open up, stop fearing intimacy and sex, and find a meaningful, loving relationship.",26

I've been in her life for 4 years and we have a good relationship. I have 2 sons that are adults now so I don't have a lot of experience with these conversations. I was also pretty wild and independent at that age so she's a much different person than I am...in a good way.

So she started flirting with a 15 yr old boy she goes to school with. I had even heard her talk about how cute he was and other seemingly innocent girl stuff and didn't think it was weird when she stopped. Usually she's very open about what's going on in her life. The long story short is that this little asshole didn't need very much encouragement to completely lose his mind. He was saying all kinds of crazy shit to scare her into doing what he wanted. This weekend we were out of town and she was at our house with some of her brothers. I guess he finally went too far and she got so scared she called the police. She said she was embarrassed and didn't want to tell her brothers so she called 911 and met the cop outside. Obviously the police let us know what was happening and went over to deal with him and his family. We are dealing with that and school and all the more concrete issues involved. 

So...He's a complete psychopath and he's been harassing her for a month! He likes to go on about how it's ""her fault"" for leading him on. He makes threats to try to get her to do what he wants and says she'll be the one who gets in trouble if she tells anyone. He lives around the corner from our house and she has been afraid to wait for the bus outside alone with him. I can't fucking believe this was going on right under our noses. What in the hell was she thinking letting him talk to her that way? Not only does she have essentially 4 parents who love her and would do anything to protect her she also has 4 older brothers! They would all be happily sitting in jail right now if they had found out before the cops did. To be clear I am not blaming her at all, she isn't in any trouble. I'm also glad the boys didn't do anything stupid. I'm just raging because I feel like we completely failed her. She's been told she can come to us about anything. We tell her all the time about not letting anyone make her feel uncomfortable, stranger danger, be safe, whatever. It's not like we haven't had conversations. But I guess none of that made the difference when real life happened. When it was a boy in her class instead of a creepy old man. I want her to be strong and independent and not take crap from this kind of predatory abusive little shit! I want her to be able to spot them and avoid them like the plague. I also don't want to scare her and come off like a paranoid man hater. Sorry for rambling but I'm just so angry right now.

Unfortunately, I have no idea what the hell a baby shower is. I've googled it to get a general idea but again, I really have no idea what the hell it is. Can you guys please explain what to expect, what gift I should bring her, and like what social traditions are part of it I guess? Thank you very much :)",0
"College Struggle, What should I do?",2,doc1mv,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/doc1mv/college_struggle_what_should_i_do/,2,1572312492.0,"Since high school I've had the diagnosis of severe anxiety and moderate depression. I'm currently in my third year at college (I'm not quite at a junior standing credit wise) and my diagnosis's have flipped. My new diagnosis is severe depression with moderate anxiety. I also have ADHD that I've only just recently started to treat. I take 300mg of Wellbutrin and it's been really helpful with my focus/ADHD and calming my anxiety. But my depression I feel like has remained untouched. I cry for no reason at random times through out my day and I feel like I'm fighting a constant urge to cry. I have no motivation to keep up with my class work and I've lost my drive for my major. On top of all that, last week I totaled my car and because I didn't have collision coverage, my insurance won't give me any money for a new car. On top of that, I'm unemployed because I wanted to focus on my course work this semester. I had saved up roughly 400$ over the summer and with my school refund I had about 1200$ in total. I now only have 200$ left which is no where near enough for a car. I've been commuting to college from my parents home to help save money and to limit the amount of loans I needed to pull out. But it's blowing up in my face. My parents constantly have some smart shit to say about my situation and try to make ""jokes"" about it. On top of that they both work full time jobs that don't match with my school schedule so it's not like I can borrow one of their cars for the mean time. My psychiatrist has been saying for me to take a medical leave, as she would write the paperwork needed for that. But I'm unsure if it's in my best interest to do so. My original goal was to graduate in 4 years but due to surgeries and other medical issues I've had to drop and retake multiple classes. My therapist and I have spoken about remaining in school as it would it help me continue to reach my degree but between financial struggles and mental battles I'm unsure if that's in my best interest either. If I were to take a medical leave I would find a full time job near my home so that I could walk to it (not that there are many job opportunities near where I live) and work to buy a car. I would also try to find an apartment and save up for at least 3-6 months worth of rent so that I could move out of my parents home with my dog. I would want to take out a small car loan and then pay that off as quickly as possible instead of just paying for it straight up with saved up money. I would only take spring semester off and then go back to school. I would even take a class or two over the summer before returning to school in the fall. But I'm unsure if I should or not. There's a lot of risk within that plan but there's also a lot of reward. But maybe I should just stay in school and continue to push through.",2

I’m not sure if this belongs here

I’ve been dating my boyfriend for close to 4 years, we’ve been through so many life changes together and recently moved in together.

I found out a couple of weeks ago that he cheated on me ... again. 
I’m in the position where I know what i have do, I know what’s healthy, I know what the next steps are supposed to be... but I don’t want to. 

I don’t want to move out, I don’t want to remove him from every part of my life, I don’t want to cancel all the plans we’ve made. Not because I’m scared to be alone, or not because I think I can’t do it. I know life would and will still be fantastic without him.
But I just don’t want to be without him?

Yet I don’t want to be with someone who would treat me like this. 

Do you have a similar story? Do you have any advice? How do you do what’s best for yourself despite not wanting to?

I started seeing a guy. We had not hooked up but had kissed and just touch each other a bit.

He was touching me I thought he was fingering me when I realize midway it feels thicker and harder than a finger. I look down and to my shock he’d stuck his penis in me without a condom and without permission. I immediately move off and communicate that I didn’t appreciate it. He starts kissing me again and it builds up and i consent to having sex with him with a condom on. I have never done anything like this before but I’m tipsy and not the best judgement.

Since said messages, he's been a total dick. 

http://imgur.com/gallery/I28Uwel

Last week she went to HR about the situation and was told to wait until Monday (today), when the HR lady would be back from vacation. 

Unfortunately she cant prove it, but it is obvious that the HR lady informed this man about the situation. 

Before this, he yells and cusses at her, tells her that she doesn't deserve the job and is nothing but lazy ( it would take me days to elaborate on all of this), and needs to bee on the floor more often (even though a majority of her job requires her being behind a desk). 

The HR lady tells her that she'll be off again today and they will deal with it tomorrow when she gets back. Around 1:00pm she gets a call from HR telling her to meet at 2:30 via conference call. She shows up and it's this guy and the guy directly below him and her alone in am office. She immediately felt intimidated and started to panick. According to my wife, the 2 guys stared at her during questioning and the subordinate defended the old prick. The old prick that was messaging her said ""I ment because she dyed her hair pink"" In which she had just done 5 days ago. These messages were sent atleast 2 months ago. He then trashed her performance and HR told her that if she couldn't fill those boots of the job, she should step down. He denied cussing and yelling at her even though she recorded the conversations from him. She didn't bring those up because she assumed she'd get fired immediately (we live in a state where only one person has to be aware of the recording). No she's terrified to return to work tomorrow and she's expecting to be fired. Oh, almost forgot, HR said it wasn't harassment because it only happened once. 

What the hell should she do?

Potential mild trigger warning for creepy/stalkery behavior. 


My husband and I spent the past few days on a mini vacation 2 hours away from home. We stopped at an ice cream place on our way back, and other than a pair of grandparents and their two small grandkids enjoying what looked like a unicorn ice cream tea party, and the employee behind the counter, there was no-one else in there. After a couple minutes, while the dude behind the counter is working on our order, a very creepy, smelly dude came in. He proceeded to walk up and stand entirely too close to me, slowly creeping closer. He wasn’t in line- he would have had to walk behind us and stand to our left to get into line. He had his arms crossed with his hands under his armpits, holding stuff in at least one of those hands. He kept leaning in toward me, and I was getting increasing danger vibes from him which made me start getting panicked. He made some awkward, stilted conversation about the price of the ice cream, but his voice sounded erratic and somewhat jittery. Hubs was having none of this sh*t, and when the creep started talking about ice cream, my husband casually moved in front of me and put himself next to the dude to point at one of the toppings. He kept himself between me and this guy the entire time we were there, and eventually creeper left. 

But then we walk out to our car and creeper is still sitting in his car, with it running and the windows down, eyeballing us. We quickly got into our car and sat there a moment waiting for the guy to drive off. He did, but then he pulled a u-turn and started heading back our way again. By this point I am freaking out inside, rapidly approaching a full on anxiety/panic attack. My husband waited till the guy was far enough away and out of eye line, and then zoomed out of the parking lot and onto the freeway. We drove awhile and then stopped at a Dunkin donuts to make sure the creep wasn’t following us and to check the car for anything he might have put on it.

Thankfully, there was nothing and he wasn’t following us and we are fine. But anxiety doesn’t like to go away just because your rational brain is saying “okay, we’re fine, it’s all fine now”. I was still really having a hard time fighting it off, and then my darling husband started talking to me about aspects of politics that he knows enrages me. When that conversation petered out, he started in on how they did my girl Daenerys so dirty in GoT and by the time I was done being enraged about that, I felt better. I knew he’d done it on purpose, and I thanked him for it. 

I’m so f***ing grateful for that man every single second. I could live a hundred lifetimes and barely deserve how awesome he is. I try to have a mindful recognition of the good things in my life at least once a day, and that was today’s. What’s yours? What happened to you today or recently that you appreciated, that was awesome, that made you happy or grateful or peaceful? Life can be so scary, so hard and so emotionally draining and I think those things get so much of our attention that sometimes the good stuff passes by without as much recognition as it deserves. Let’s give some extra focus to the good stuff. 




And also, as an aside- be careful out there everyone. Be vigilant and don’t EVER feel bad for listening to your instincts or doing something a little “paranoid” to protect yourself.",32

Did anyone else have like, harsh side effects with the nexplanon? I had mine inserted back in mid February, and I want to rip out. 

-I have gained over 15 pounds, and quickly. I am usually fairly small, weighing about 105, so this weight gain is a lot, and very noticeable. According to google-significant weight gain isn’t a common side effect. 
-I was bleeding about 20ish days out of the month...about 2 weeks consistently bleeding and about another week of annoying inconsistent spotting.
-Cramps have been so so bad. And because of all the bleeding, there isn’t much of a break from the cramping. 
-I feel bloated as fuck. Like aside from the weigh gain-I am definitely carrying around more bloat. 
-Emotionally I feel like I am basically PMS’ing 24/7. Annoyed and irritated with everything. crying over nothing.
-My boobs are HUGE. I already have fake boobs-and the last two months, they have definitely grown. Enough that other people are asking me about it, a lot. They are also sore and achey a lot, lately. 

I actually took a pregnancy test this morning because I legit was afraid I was pregnant, as most of all these are pregnancy symptoms as well. 

Anyone else have side effects this bad with it?? Did you go back to “normal” quickly after having it removed? I have an appt tomorrow, and I think I am going to take it out but I don’t know what else I can use for BC. The pills made my migraines so much worse. Shot I gained like 25 pounds and was an emotional, crazy mess. The last IUD I had dislodged and traveled a bit. Is there anything left aside from condoms?

&#x200B;

I just wanted to talk about an incident that happened to me 2 weeks ago, because I can't with family. My ex-fiance and I broke up and he came over to try and mend things. Instead, he got drunk and began to hit me and break my things in my own place. Something he has never done before.

But it's not about the trauma that I want to talk about. It's how I controlled the situation. I called the cops and got him out of there and made sure he got to the hospital. My only regret is that I didn't press charges even though the cops said I had enough evidence and support to. 

I went through a hellish night on my own and here I am feeling stronger than ever on my birthday. No one in my friends or family knows what happened, yet they're all here supporting me and being there for me. I have awesome coworkers, an awesome job, an awesome apartment. My whole life that I made on my own with my own hard work and money. 

Truth is, he is probably the weakest man I've ever met. He had no strength to be strong and move forward in his life. He showed it time and time again and I was blinded by love thinking that I saw things others couldn't see. 

When multiple people from different cultures and walks of life tell you someone is weak... Try and see through the love and not be blind. Take what your loved ones say about your SO into consideration. But know, you have the strength inside you to handle any situation. You're never weak. You have power. You always have the power to leave and you will be more than okay.",0

I used to have a huge crush on him when I was in fifth grade. He was cute, played football, and scored good grades but used to be quiet and didn't have that many friends. I was kinda shy, the good girl, and basically a huge nerd. So, I had a massive crush on him for like, four years? Every time he came around, I used to get awfully shy, freak out and say something stupid. We had couple of interactions before I gathered up my courage and texted him in ninth grade. He replied and we started talking. We use to talk about anything and everything. We use to spend all night texting, but we never called. We were both equally shy to do just that. So we sticked to texting for around eight months. We had some common friends by then, and we use to meet at parties. We were now on talking terms but I always use to get afraid when talking to him. What if I said something wrong, and he gets offended. So, we kept it low key, and made small talks when talking in person. 

He became a good friend of mine, and I still had a crush on him. So, I gathered my courage and told him just that, on text. It was during the holidays, so I knew we won't be coming face to face anytime soon. He acted weird to it, and said that he just want to be my friend and that he doesn't want to break my heart. It hurt a little but I was okay in being friends. We then started texting again, like we used to. We tried to act normal in school around each other. But I knew that things were not like it used to be. 

He confessed to me once that he used to have crush on my best friend but moved on when she went into a relationship with some older guy. But my best friend recently broke up with that guy. She was my best friend since third grade. We both use to have a crush on him in seventh grade, and when we confessed it to each other, we made a deal to not approach him first, unless he does. The deal was off when she went into other the relationship with that old guy. She even tried to set me up with him in tenth grade but it didn't work out. But they both became good friends and I became kinda jealous. However I knew my best friend would never betray me for a guy. But when she got dumped, she started getting closer to him behind my back. 

And one day, three years ago, they both told me that they're in a relationship. I was so hurt, that I dumped my best friend and didn't talk that guy till last month. I really, really liked him a lot. I thought maybe it would fade with time but it didn't. I wanted a closure, because even though the guy never told me he liked me, his actions use to say different things. Like, standing close to me during the parties, or clicking my candids, touching that cross the friend's boundaries and saying stuff on text that sounded like coming from someone who likes you. 

And, I use to think about it a lot. But, then I thought maybe it was my mind playing games with me. I was so fed up that last month I texted him after two years. I asked him that if he was in love with my best friend, why did he say and did all that stuff to me. He said that our friendship had been a mistake and that he doesn't want me in his life. 

Now, all I want to do is move on. I've tried everything, literally everything and I just can't seem to get him off my mind. Help me.",0

I got a no contact order with the school. He of course broke the no contact order, and the school gave him a ""warning"". I then went to get actual legal help an apparently had barely enough evidence to get a Protective Order until I said the magic words ""he has manic bipolar and has stopped taking his meds.""

It's now a year later in Oct 2019 and we are both still at the same school. He is still living in my apartment complex and he has tried reaching out to me again.

After this time of contact in Oct 2019, I blocked him on everything. 

I am afraid for my safety because I know he is extremely angry at me still and ""wants me to pay for leaving him"". 

What can I do? The school is useless in prosecuting these things and another ""warning"" will not help me. How can I build enough evidence for a restraining order or another protective order?

I'd read a post here the other night asking if someone had any advice for a woman who might be having a hard time adjusting to her work environment so thought I'd see if there was anything out there by someone who was more appropriate to be giving out such kind of advice and, it was not only eye-opening to find out what it was and how it'd gotten started but by whom... this woman put everything of herself into this, her mind-her money-her madness, for other women and yet it was heartbreaking to read about how she was made to suffer in the end.

A guy I was seeing sent me pictures of him cutting himself when I told him I'm too busy to talk,22,do1ogq,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/do1ogq/a_guy_i_was_seeing_sent_me_pictures_of_him/,22,1572252056.0,"Hi all. This happened about an hour ago, it's currently 3 AM here. I couldn't get it out of my head so I thought maybe I should write about it here.

A guy(20M) ""slid in my(21F) dms"" on Instagram about two weeks ago. He asked something about my story, which was related to being Arab and I answered him. We started a pretty enjoyable conversation and we discussed a lot of issues with the Arab world. We realized we both had a lot in common, and we just kept texting for the next week. At some point, he called me and I had a lot of fun speaking with him. After a while, it became video calls and it was great. He asked me out eventually and I told him I was sorry but I'm not interested in dating as I'm busy with work and study but I really enjoy your friendship and he told me that he'd still be my friend, and kept hinting that maybe one day it'll be more. (um.)

That's the background. Tonight he kept messaging and calling me and I ignored him for a bit (I needed to study). At some point, he's sent me like 10 texts and called 2-3 times. I told him I'm sorry, I'm busy I can't talk right now. He replies with ""I thought we were friends, friends talk to each other. Are you upset? Why are you ignoring me?"" etc. I told him I'm not upset, I need my alone time and he kept pestering me to pick up. I picked up his phone call and asked him to please stop calling me, I'm busy. He said okay.

After about \~10 minutes, he sends me two pictures of his entire arm covered with fresh cuts. He also says ""I was really upset... look how my arm looks hahaha."" My younger sister whom I love deeply used to cut herself and that was a huge powerless point in my life. I could taste the blood in my mouth when I saw those pictures. I told him to please seek help, and he kept laughing and telling me ""it's fine it's just something I do when I'm upset.""

&#x200B;

I feel so weirded out. I barely know this person, but from our conversations, he seemed incredibly nice, funny and charming. I almost felt bad about rejecting him. Gah, I know this was a manipulative thing for him to do, but I also feel like I'm somehow responsible. God, a dick pic would've been better.

&#x200B;

Thank you for reading my late-night vent.

\[Edit\] This is my first time posting here. I feel so overwhelmingly supported. I'm going to let my sister know that this is an incredibly safe space. Ya'll literally cleared out any doubts I had! I messaged his brother and told him what happened, and then blocked him and his brother. Thank you, everyone.",22

I'm just getting so tired of it, but I don't know how to make it stop. He's a sweet guy, and a good friend otherwise, but I dread it whenever the topic goes towards this again. I don't know how to tell him politely ""not now"", especially since I rather want to say ""please no more, at all"".




He's not hitting on me or anything (I'm in a relationship for as long as he's known me, plus we live in different countries), so it's not that.

Was this creepy or am I blowing it out of proportion?,2,do87dm,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/do87dm/was_this_creepy_or_am_i_blowing_it_out_of/,10,1572294821.0,"So, yesterday afternoon I was going somewhere to meet my mom and on the street one of those guys who hand out brochures for beauty centers stopped me. I tried to say I don’t have time but he was Oliver Twist-type begging so just to not be awkward I agreed to go with him so I can “drop off the brochure” and he can get his 15 bucks. Now I shouldn’t have believed that, I should’ve just kept walking but...ugh. 

So he leads me to the nearby apartment building, where all new low-end beauty centers in Turkey tend to be located so that’s not weird by itself but he’s talking. And talking. Complimenting my hair (it *is* a very nice pink), asking where I’m from, saying I’m being “coy” (??????) when I say I don’t want to share that, slapping my shoulder...kill bill sirens were on at that point walking up the stairs. So we reach the door of the center, the apartment building is dark & I’m feeling very uncomfortable but that’s where it gets worse.

He said I just have to give the brochure and don’t have to buy anything, right? A pretty blonde girl opens the door and they want to show the services and stuff and serve tea. But I genuinely didn’t have that kind of time (mom waiting), so I was like “here’s your brochure as you said, I’ll be off” and the girl doesn’t do anything but he kinda goes off, INSISTING. “Why are you doing this” type like I broke up with him after 9 long years. At one point briefly his hand is on my BACK to make me stay. Then I’m basically shoving the brochure in her hand and booking it downstairs to the background music of “You know you came up for nothing right? A 5yo wouldn’t do what you’re doing right now” continuing as he follows me down. He stops following when I’m out the door &  I’m muttering “okay..okay...” for lack of anything else and I make it to meet my mom, thankfully.

I think I was drugged last night,10,do3dx6,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/do3dx6/i_think_i_was_drugged_last_night/,24,1572261560.0,"I’m posting this hoping someone can help me understand.

Last night I was with my friends celebrating my birthday. I had two drinks before I went out, and from 10-12 I had two more. At 12, we went to a different bar and I had one final drink. 

I was with my friends the entire night, and I was completely coherent and happy. Towards the end my cheeks were definitely warm and I felt buzzed but I was not at all drunk. I was mixing in water occasionally too. 

At the second bar, I saw a guy I knew from high school and college, and we were catching up. The bar was really crowded and he asked to go out on the patio, and that’s the last thing I remember. 

I woke up in my friend’s guest bed with a trash can and a bottle of water next to me. A friend of mine saw me on the patio and she said she immediately felt red flags. When she came over to check on me, the guy said that he was going to drive me home. She called my friend from my phone, and another friend ordered me an Uber and took me back to my friend’s place. 
It took a guy, and my friend who’s 5’9 to carry me upstairs to bed. I’m 5’4 and 120 pounds. 


I know 5 drinks might sound like a lot but I am a social drinker and I have drank significantly more different nights, without this intense result. All of my friends described it like a switch went off and I went from coherent to just lifeless. 

My gut is telling me that guy slipped something in my drink but I genuinely don’t know how I’ll ever prove it. I’ve felt so awful and confused and rotten all day today.


Edit: my blood test came back positive for ambien. I’m filing a police report. Thank you all for your supportive messages. I’m not ok at all but it could have been much worse",10

I broke up with my abusive boyfriend three years ago and it still haunts me,9084,dnf6zi,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dnf6zi/i_broke_up_with_my_abusive_boyfriend_three_years/,414,1572132012.0,"I started dating him senior year of college. I already had a job in a city 4 hours away. He didn't have a job yet but found one close to where I would be. We graduate, move there and get separate apartments about an hour away from each other. 

He doesn't like spending nights by himself, so we spend almost every night sleeping over at each other's apartments, but he doesn't like long commutes, so 90% of the time we stay at his place. I get an hour commute every morning, he gets a 15 minute commute. 

He likes to play video games, but I'm not really a fan. Too bad, we can't possibly do separate things, we love each other and should want to be together all the time. I spend most of my nights watching him play video games.

He demands we text each other all throughout the day. My work doesn't like me to be on my phone. I find a way to appease him by using an internet browser messaging service. I'm expected to answer him within 60 seconds. If I mess up, it's because I don't love him enough. I have to tell him when I'm leaving my desk so he doesn't ""get sad waiting for me to respond.""

If we don't ""connect"" well enough over the day, he will want to ""eat dinner alone."" Which means he will pick up fast food on the way home, and then spend the rest of the night completely ignoring me. But I'm still required to watch him play video games. I just have to do it in silence while he seethes at me from the other end of the couch. If I don't follow the normal night schedule, I am showing him how ""I don't care enough to make it up to him."" Except I don't understand what I did wrong and what I need to make up to him.

I learn to manage his emotions. I know what will set him off and how. I hide things from him. I went out to lunch with my coworkers today, but he had packed my lunch the night before? I make sure I throw out the reciept where he won't find it. I even dump the lunch he made me so I can bring home an empty container. But this doesn't work all the time, because when something happens that's out of my control, it's still my fault and I get punished. 

He breaks up with me at least one a week. He gets so angry that he ""just can't handle all the stress I put him through."" But I know he doesn't mean it. It's my job to talk him down. I apologize and tell him everything is my fault and I will fix it in the future. We do this so often, I start to believe it.

I call my friends crying a lot. Am I a bad person for doing [insert latest argument] to my boyfriend? They get tired of having the same conversations with me. ""Just break up with him."" But how could I? I stop calling them. I worry they are judging me. They think I'm weak or stupid for staying with him. They don't understand.

He starts getting resentful. He doesn't like the city that I picked. He doesn't like his job. He doesn't have any friends here. He nitpicks at my life to show me how I shouldn't like my job either. He constantly tells me that my friends ""just don't seem like my people"". I have to run any after-work events by him. He usually finds excuses for me not to go. ""But babe, we planned on going to the grocery store tonight. You can't make me do that by myself. Don't you love me?"" Don't I love him?

He starts suggesting we move. He reminisces about his hometown. It's so much nicer than this city. His parents would be so happy if he moved back. He has friends there. Our lives would be so much better there. I'm not sure. But ""I don't like my job so it shouldn't be hard for me to leave."" 

We both find jobs near his family. Mine starts in August, but he doesn't have a start date yet. He tells me to move up anyway. He will be up there soon. So I move up and start my job. He comes up every weekend. We spend time with his friends and his family. He is very happy.

Except now it's September and October and he still doesn't have a start date. He calls the company every week, but they are waiting on his background check. There is nothing he can do but wait. He does not take that well. It's my fault. Did I tell the company something that would delay his background check? I shouldn't have taken this job before he had a start date. It's my fault we are living 5 hours from each other. How could I do this to him? Didn't I love him?

He comes up to see me for Halloween. He walks in the door but doesn't say hi. He glares at me. I didn't call him on his drive up to see me? He was bored! How could I have left him to be so bored? He was putting time and energy into coming up to see me, but I couldn't even bother to call him while he was driving? Was I an idiot? How could I do that to him? Didn't I love him?

He told me we were over. This time, I don't play my defined role. I say ""ok."" He is livid. I am supposed to fight back, but I don't have the energy. He throws things on the floor and goes to his parents. 

I start packing. I'm going to drive 2 hours to my parents. I can't be here anymore. While I'm packing he comes back. He's talked with his parents about our fight and he is going to give me another chance. I still don't apologize. I tell him I'm really breaking up with him and I'm going to my parents house. He cracks. He alternates between yelling at me, throwing things, and sobbing on my shoulder. 

I tell him I want to leave, but he won't let me. I try to leave but he physically holds me back. He tells me ""I'm not allowed to leave until I understand."" I tell him I do understand and this is my decision. He responds if this is my decision, I obviously don't understand well enough. 

After and hour, I am finally allowed to leave. I drive to my parents house, I'm so emotionally and physically exhausted. They don't ask questions and just give me a hug. God bless them. 

I spend the next month living with my parents commuting to work 2 hours each way. I'm afraid to go back to my apartment because he has a key. He texts and calls me 100s of times in this period. I don't answer. I'm depressed. I feel like a shell of a person. 

I slowly make steps back to being a human. I go back to living in my apartment. I make a friend at work. I try dating. My friends from college visit me and help me back to my feet. Three years go by and to the outside observer, I'm all better.

But to this day I'm still terrified that I'll see him again. I still have nightmares about him. I still live in his hometown. I avoid his favorite bars. I worry I will see him at the grocery store. Writing this all down made me shake and cry. 

I'm not sure how to end this, but Halloween always brings me back to those dark times. I feel so lucky to have been able to leave that situation, but sometimes I feel like my mind is still there. 

Maybe someone will read this and see a little of themselves in it. To you, I say that you are not stupid. You are not weak. You are being manipulated and abused. Your friends and family will still love you. You can leave. You can do it.",9084

Tonight, a mother and daughter walked up to me and the mom asked if I would take a picture with her daughter. As the girl is coming over to me she turns and gives her mom a ""look"". Mom rolls her eyes and said, ""Well, you don't talk!"" 

This young girl, who couldn't have been more than 13, looks at her mother and says, ""Yes, I do,"" to which mom replies, ""No you don't!"" 

And my heart sank. I recognize this interaction. For a moment I went back in time 30 years to my own mother making similar statements about me. (Though, to be fair, the one thing my mother *never* accused me of was not talking!) I could hear the confusion and embarrassment in the girl's tone. I could almost hear her *thinking*, ""But I'm talking right now! You just *heard me speak*! What am I doing wrong?"" 

I wanted SO BADLY to lean over and say something, **anything** to let that girl know that I SAW that. I heard it. That her mom was wrong. I was going to lean down and say, ""I know you only speak when you have something to say,"" or some such nonsense. 

But I didn't. It wasn't quite safe. I wasn't willing to risk the mom hearing me, or worse, notice me leaning down over her child and accuse me of something terrible. When you've been doing this as long as I have, you get a sense for the customers and their likely reactions. My instincts are still telling me I made the right call to keep myself safe, I know that. But I think maybe I should have risked it this time? 

I don't know. I just know I cried when I was talking about it when we got home. I wish I had been able to say *something*.",97
My boyfriend's dad drunkenly spooned me and I feel gross.,19,dnwo0z,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dnwo0z/my_boyfriends_dad_drunkenly_spooned_me_and_i_feel/,6,1572226381.0,"Hi, ladies!
Long time lurker here, and something happened that I don't really know how to deal with. I'll start by saying I'm quitting smoking, and it's been one whole week. I'm proud of that. 
Last night, I slept at my boyfriend's house. He lives with his parents, which has always been fine with me, because I adore his family and spending time with them as well. Usually, we retire to his room, put on a show, and go to bed. And that's what we did. I sleep completely naked, by the way, which I guess is something I shouldn't have done, and won't really do again.
At about 3 AM my boyfriend's dad staggers in, absolutely blackout drunk, shoves me aside, slips on the bed, and starts spooning me. Reeking of alcohol. My brain short circuited and the only thing I could think to do was just.... Play dead. So I did. I laid there, wanting to die, until my boyfriend sat up from the commotion and started shoving him off me, saying 'dude, dude, wrong bed'
He finally left. My boy tried to ask me if I was okay, but for some reason I just kept pretending to be asleep. I feel really gross. I feel like my coping mechanism is gone.
It's not even that bad, nothing happened really, but I can't shake the nausea and unease and fight or flight and wanting to cry.
I'm not even sure what do to. I'm not sure why I'm posting here. I'm not sure how to get out of his room now.
Thanks you reading, thanks for any advice, I'm so lost.",19

So, this fall my sexual abuse came to light. My mother's husband was grooming me for years, and it finally came to light. To quote the police his grooming was ""textbook."" I dont want to say everything that happened. Ive told that story enough.

However, when it all came out my mother blamed me for it. She just argued the details of the abuse with me to try to twist it and make it my fault. She wouldn't even look at me, eventually. I truly felt disgusting.

It came to ahead when she asked me to lie to CPS. I didn't. I told them everything and she yelled at me. That night she left to try and commit suicide with her husband. She spent a week in a psych ward, and once she got out i wasnt allowed around her. She and her husband both failed at commiting suicide that night. 

About a week later, her husband did finally commit suicide and since then shes acted as nothing has happened. I'm so confused. I don't really understand why she's taken this 180 over his death. 

Do any of you have any idea why she suddenly acts as she did before everything came out?",10
I don't even feel bad for going to someone else...,0,dodgzv,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dodgzv/i_dont_even_feel_bad_for_going_to_someone_else/,0,1572318226.0,"tl:DR: My current partner/future ex bailed on me at a crucial time for our relationship and came back after breaking up with me via text message. In the interim, I went to scout for other dick and met someone who matches my energy and needs, in addition to making it clear that he wants to be those things I want. Partner is out of town working after four months out of work and Idk how to break it to him that it's over. I know what to do, I just don't know how to pull the trigger.

&#x200B;

I have always been an extremely loyal person up until a few weeks ago. My partner took off with the rent due and bailed on me - he also broke up with me over text message after days of trying to get him to come home so we could figure out what to do next and even see if we could salvage things. 

He remained gone for a few more days and through my tears and a deep desire to have sex and intimacy, I jumped on the THOT busses known as Tinder and Bumble. After a few lame dicks, I met this guy who met me with the same energy - we clicked immediately and when we met up, our chemistry was (and still is) so wild to me. Unlike my ex, who is divorced with three kids by two different women and both of those relationships ended poorly, he ran out on me, and when he came back, he came back with no answers, reasons for his options and his tail between his legs. I let him come back to our home, and now he's out of town working. 

As I am looking for a new place to live, I am looking for a place just for me - thinking about breaking off our two-and-a-half-year relationship and opt for some me time and to see where the new guy goes - you know, for once have some fun and enjoy my life instead of moving too fast into a new relationship. My mom + closest friends agree that I need to take some time for myself and my current/possible future ex is the one in the wrong, never meeting my clearly laid out expectations and unforgiving understanding for all of his traumas, baby momma drama in addition to being out of work for four months and lying on our couch while I paid all of the bills (he was awfully depressed, but I persisted because I thought he would eventually get out of it because he does this every few months). 

The side piece is touchy-feely like me, loves to kiss, doesn't push me away and gives me attention because I've expressed that's what I want and that's what he wants and likes in return. He's totally overwhelmed with the attention and enjoys my company. 

My current partner likes to hide out in his man cave for hours at a time, not engage until he's ready to explode and every conversation is about his past experiences and his life and how he'd handle something if it happened to him...it has gotten old. His disappearance is particularly hurtful since his many empty promises led to us getting evicted from our home while I paid the other bills to stay current (he said he had a plan...I know, I am so stupid). He has an expectation that I am going to miraculously find a place for the BOTH OF US without us. He also controls our sex life - because of past traumas that won't get help to overcome and resolve, we only have sex when he wants to...that could be four days in a row or no sex for 4 weeks.

I have been super patient with all of his quirks, but my current partner refuses to be accountable for the hurt he's caused me and I can't get past that he actually did it and I allowed him back into my life after causing me that much pain. I even put up with the fact that a woman reached out to me stating my partner was planning on breaking up with me and returning to her and sent screenshots of their conversations. My partner believes he convinced me that his family. whom he's not close with, put her up to it because he could not lend them money. He did admit that he previously dated her and he was really mean to her in the end. I don't want to be in a relationship like that. 

The only thing the other guy knows is what was the truth at the time: that my partner bailed on me during a tenuous time and stopped responding and broke up with me via text and I was over it.",0

How do I stop feeling threatened or jealous of other girls who get close to my boyfriend?,0,do6u8r,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/do6u8r/how_do_i_stop_feeling_threatened_or_jealous_of/,7,1572286385.0,"My BF and I met in high school, and we started dating when we graduated 3 years ago. I've found myself to be really jealous of any other girls he has a closer relationship with.

A bit of background first: when we first started dating, a mutual female friend of ours, who was in my class, had a crush on him. She would invite him out to go clubbing, dinners and movies, and even asked him to be her date to some social at her university (which he went to). She would cancel if he asked to bring me along. At one point, she told him some secrets which he could ""never"" tell me. He kept insisting that she was just a friend, or at least he treated her like one, but he refused to back down because it would be ""rude"" to cut her off. Honestly, I felt kind of humiliated by this girl because of how much she was manipulating my BF and I was still trying so hard to be nice to her (giving her gifts, helping her with her club promotions etc) because I wanted to be her friend. Eventually we talked about it, and he stopped talking to her. This incident broke me the most.

The reason why I'm making this post is that he recently started playing online games with a girl he met in class. The girl has a boyfriend, who is also a friend of my BF's. It started off as a joke when his friend put his GF on, they had fun and it has been continuing (he says its fun to teach her). The other day he was driving when his phone beeped, and he asked me who the message was from. I didn't read the message, but I saw the profile picture of the girl. It was a nickname (a character from the game) with a :P emoji instead of her contact name. I know they're chatting quite a bit already because he's open about it (""Look at this meme GF just me"" or ""oh that's just a message from GF""). I feel bad. Apparently the friend is chill with it, but I don't want a repeat of history. I tried to tell to him today but he got really mad and defensive.

To let you have some more insight into the relationship history, he once had a crush on my best friend a week after he ""broke up"" with me in middle school, and he asked me to be his wingman without knowing that I still wasn't over him. A year into dating, he asked me who my best friend was and I said him, which was and is true. When I flipped the question around he listed Anna, Betty, Catherine and Denise from this and that class in university. I honestly felt stabbed in the gut.

Long story short, I think this has made me become very... threatened by any close female friends that he has. I know it's natural to have platonic friendships yada yada but I can't accept it. Also, I have a history of eating disorder (anorexia and bulimia) and am still dealing with body dysmorphic issues, and I can't help add body shape to my comparisons and I'm tired of being so negative. Have you got any similar experiences to share and how did you get over it?",0

I was at my job and a guy driving a forklift lost some of his boxes. I along with 6 others helped pick them up. It was in that moment, this man fell in love with me. 
He kept trying to touch me, asking me out, and wouldn't leave me alone unless he saw a man coming. I didn't know what he was doing was harassment. It only stopped because one lady had enough of it and reported him. 
He was suspended for 3 months and then moved to a different shift and different part of the factory so that he could stay away from me. 
But the thing that surprised me is that some ladies thought that reporting him was going too far. They knew everything he did and still thought he was harmless. 
Worst part was I was 22 and he was in his 60's-70's.

I need to vent about something. Warning it’s sexual harassment related.,15,dnuhma,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dnuhma/i_need_to_vent_about_something_warning_its_sexual/,26,1572217385.0,"I’m about to write about something that happened to my husband last night at a party. This is probably not the right sub but I really don’t know where it should go. Because this is usually something that happens to women. There is a TLDR at the bottom because this is a lot of txt. 

So my husband requested to be a barbarian this year and if you look through my post history you can find his costume. In my opinion it’s not risky but I also don’t really label clothing as risky and I base things off of situations. But regardless he’s shirtless with a fur mantel covering his shoulders and nipples. He was also wearing what is essentially a short skirt covered in leather and fur. He felt really confident in his outfit and had been putting it on and goofing off in ever sense I finished it. So we were invited to our friends yearly Halloween party. My husband asked if there was kids and will he need to wear a shirt and I told him no not unless he wanted to. Because I didn’t think anything like this would have happened. So off we went and when we got there so far everything was fine it was early into the night. 

My husband got a lot of complement on his costume. But then as the night stretches on about three of the older guys there. I say older because my husband and I were the youngest and we are in our 20’s. So these guys were pushing maybe their late 30’s early 40’s? So the three of them were moving around the party and non stop flirting with anyone making eye contact. I was keeping an eye on the girls they were talking to making sure they weren’t acting like they were trapped in a conversation with a dude who was being a total creep. You know the look. Then one of them came out to talk with a girl on the porch across from my husband and I. My husband and I were talking to our friend who had hosted the event. This guy came up with the girl in tow who looked a little uncomfortable and now we know why. This dude turns to my husband and says “Can I pinch your nipples?” By this time in the night my husband had gotten to warm to wear the fur mantel so I was wearing it. He was essentially shirtless at this point and looked at the dude and very clearly and firmly said “No”. Then this guy persisted and kept asking saying he told this girl he was going to pinch my husbands nipples for her. 

She shot me the ‘I didn’t fucking say this and I don’t know this guy at all’ look and then I threw my hand in front of my husbands chest and said. “Hey man as his wife I’m baring you from doing this. The answer is no.” I was trying to de-escalate the situation as much as I could. And he rambles off on some stuff saying how I wasn’t fun and my husband just had his nipples out. How he just wanted to make the chick he walked over with uncomfortable because he thought I guess it was funny? I repeated my husbands no and moved my hand because it seemed this dude was done. Nope that jerk grabbed my husbands nipple and gave it a good solid pinch the moment I moved my hand. My husband then turned to him and said “Okay fine take your shirt off and let me do you then!” To that the dude responded with “No No No I mean I can’t I don’t pull off the shirtless look.” And my husband being a guy who respected no backed off without persisting. Then the guy turned to me and said “I’m sorry I didn’t realize you were his wife. This chick made some comments about your husband and I didn’t realize y’all were married. I was just trying to make her uncomfortable.” No one in this group thought he was funny and then when realizing that he looked at me and said “Did it work though are you uncomfortable.” And I responded with “No agitated” And this dude seemed genially shocked that no one found his joke funny. He then told me that wasn’t his intent and I responded with telling him something along the lines of no means no. To which he just wondered away upset. 

The girl that had walked over with him was apologizing profusely and saying she doesn’t know anyone her and picked the wrong person to talk to. I had told her it was okay that it’s not her fault he doesn’t understand boundaries. The rest of the night other guys tried shit and even one guy grabbed my husbands junk. Each time one of these guys tried something my husband gave them a firm no and I also gave them a no. But it killed the party for me and it left the both of us in raged. It’s never okay to touch any person especially if you were denied consent to do what you’re about to do. I really felt for my husband in that moment because I have been in his shoes countless times. My husband knows this and he’s always been one of those 100% consent people. If there’s a shadow of a doubt he will clarify if something is okay because that’s just what you do. No one should be subjected to stuff like that and no one should ever think it’s okay.

TLDR: Husband got sexually harassed at a party. Three dudes grabbed his nipples and his junk without consent. Even after both my husband and I said no.",15

"I was too tight for penetrative vaginal sex, any tips on how I can 'loosen myself up' abit?",3,dnzc9g,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dnzc9g/i_was_too_tight_for_penetrative_vaginal_sex_any/,12,1572240006.0,"Okay, so I'm an 18 year old woman and me and my sort of 'friend' tried having sex together last night. With it being my first time (plus I'm on my 2nd day of a light period) and him being endowed with an above average penis I understood that it would definitely hurt, even with foreplay and lube and his experience.

After quite a bit of some very enjoyable foreplay and learning of what exactly got me off we gave it ago. I was on top to give me some more control and as I lowered myself down on him, whilst trying to relax as much as possible, it got really painful. After a bit we managed to put the head in completely but it hurt me so much that he told me to get off because he didnt want to rip me. He said my vagina was really really tight to the point were it almost hurt him.

We went back to doing some oral once I'd relaxed again to try and null the stinging and tried a few more times, all of which were unsuccessful. At one point I had almost half of him in but it hurt so much I was brought to tears and he pulled out before I managed to say the safe word simply because he could see how much pain I was in. He was very understanding and gentle with me and tried to give possible reasons for it hurting so much, such as me being on my period. My period this time is light and I was act the stage were I got pretty damn excited quite alot, so rather then my period being the issue i think it was actually how tight I am and probably his size.

In terms of length he is definitely above average, I think he was actually longer than 6"", in terms of thickness about 1½""(about 2½ of my fingers in width). Now I can get a finger in right down to the base easily, and so can he, his tongue went in pretty easily too and I can get a tampon in no problem so I'm pretty sure I don't have vaginismus. So I'm assuming the problem is me being unaccustomed to having something that thick in me, compared to just the 1 finger I can easily put in.

So basically I just want some tips on what to do to get  something thicker in me and get used to it. Should I start trying to put more fingers in gradually? Would getting used to 2 or 3 fingers be enough? Should I try a sex toy? Personally I don't want to have sex with anyone other than him because I'm only attracted to him sexually. I have zero interest in anyone else, probably because I'm attracted him in a romantic and sexually way. We don't see eachother often because he is at University pretty far away and we aren't in a committed relationship because of the sheer distance so there's no rush, and I'm not desperate to lose my virginity (properly).

Just some tips from any women who have gone through this and have experience would be nice please.

Thankyou.

EDIT: Thankyou for the advice everyone :). In reality I think one of the 'problems' was how nervous I was, which I know is completely natural and just takes some relaxation and getting used to. I wasn't expecting 'perfect sex' like what happens in porn (personally I detest porn, probably because it just isnt realistic and it actually makes me feel sick lol), and I wasnt expecting it to feel good from the get go either, though I will admit that I think I was rushing it a bit.

I typically dont masturbate by putting fingers in so fingering isnt really something that I find enjoyable at this stage, so I think I'll work on that first. We both definitely enjoyed to oral alot and to be honest I was more bothered about making him feel good than anything else (not to the point were I was forcing my self to have sex with him of course).

Anyway I'll put an end to this edit before I continue to ramble on lol.

Thankyou all again for the advice and sharing of your experiences, you have all opened my eyes to what is really most important. Thankyou",3

I keep going back and forth in my head and it’s been 4 months since we split up. 

I loved this guy with all my heart, I gave him everything, which is what I feel contributed to us breaking up, I gave him too much of my life and felt resentment when he couldn’t give me the same back. I don’t think I’ll ever meet anyone as funny, charming, handsome, and lovely as him. 

The break up was both our faults. We met too close after his previous relationship of 7 yrs ended. He told me he had a 10 month gap between but when we broke up he told me this was in fact only 2 months :(.  I distinctively remember feeling like he was a bit withdrawn at the beginning of our relationship and he used to always reassure me and told me to be patient with him and to stick by him.

About a year into our relationship he compared me to his ex girlfriend. He said he was only giving me 50/60% and that his relationship with his ex was fire and that he wanted to take her around the world and hadn’t felt like that with me, and that he sometimes thought I needed to be with a loser boyfriend, but then said I’m the prettiest and most caring girl he’s ever been with. He said I would be shocked if I could see how he was with his ex girlfriend. When I said that we should probably break up he said he really wanted to try and work on things as he wanted to give me more and so I agreed.

As a result of everything, in the following months I became quite insecure. I subconsciously felt as though I had something to prove and forgot who I was a person. I guess I lost myself, and was no longer doing things that made me happy in the past and was so focused on my job, exams and him.

At the time it felt like everything was somehow my fault. He once shouted at me when I initiated sex and literally said “I’ve had the most stressful day at work, all I want to do is relax and not stress that my girlfriend is grabbing my dick every 2 seconds”. He apologised after he realised how this upset me. It really shocked me because I didn’t realise I was making him feel uncomfortable and it wasn’t like we were even having sex that much. Out of my ex boyfriends, he’s wanted sex the least and I guess I always wondered why, if I ever brought it up he got annoyed and said that I’m going to ruin our relationship over sex which isn’t even important when looking for a life partner. He then told me he’d want it more if I initiated less and played more hard to get. It was honestly very confusing.

I work in the financial district and my exams were very tough, and I think the stress got the better of me and I seemed a bit sad at times / grumpy, although I was still prioritising him in my life. He didn’t like me sad and would say he felt like he was walking on egg shells around me which would make me feel like I would need to be switch on when I was with him. 

I guess since he compared me to his ex girlfriend, I became a lot more aware of what I was doing in the relationship vs what he was doing. I started venting a lot to friends, and I was often scared to communicate this insecurity of mine in fear he would break up with me. It was never that I didn’t trust him, but I didn’t trust our relationship lasting if that makes sense. I found it difficult to think too far into the future because I felt he would break up with me. A week before we broke up I remember stupidly texting him and asking what his views on cheating were as I guess I felt a bit nervous that he was going on a lads work holiday and I felt as though things were off between us. I have beat myself up about that text over and over, because I think that’s what made him decide to not be with me anymore.

When we broke up he said he had tried to make things work and I was very confused on what he had actually done to try. But looking back, I know he did try, he tried to be patient with me, but things were just getting worse for me in my head with feeling like I wasn't good enough. I used to look at other couples and wish that my boyfriend acted like that with me. I feel like I sabotaged the relationship in my head, and I know for a fact I will never meet someone who makes me laugh as much as he did. He was so incredibly charming, handsome and had a great personality :(. 

I tried to meet up for a coffee with him a few weeks back but he forgot and made other plans. I was really hurt by this because I couldn’t think how he would forget he was meeting up with me. I had asked him which days suited him too so I just couldn’t understand it :(. He asked if we could reschedule but I’m not sure if there is any point. I don’t want to feel this hurt anymore. 

I keep blaming myself because I feel as though when i was with him, I was no longer living in the present and focused too much on what happened in the past. He’s my one that got away.

I've recently started on the birth control pill (I started on my period). However, it's been common to me that during the middle of my natural cycles, usually when I'm ovulating, I feel a slight twinge on my ovaries, usually the right. I kind of feel this now, and it's my 14th day on the pill. I've heard of this thing called breakthrough ovulation, and I'm just scared and want to know if it's possible to feel symptoms of ovulation on the pill and actually still be ovulating. 

Has anyone ever felt this and not ovulated? Or has anyone felt this and actually did end up ovulating? I hope this makes sense.

My roommate and I were drugged while out at the bars. I’m having a hard time wrapping my head around it. Looking for advice.,37,dnpipk,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dnpipk/my_roommate_and_i_were_drugged_while_out_at_the/,11,1572184760.0,"Hi there. I’ve been a lurker here for a long time and I know it’s a great community for women to help each other, which is exactly what I’m needing right now. Well, just like the title says, my roommate and I (both 21, F) were drugged (likely roofied?) two nights ago while at the bars. We know who we suspect did it, but since we have no proof and only their first names to go off of I don’t think there’s any action we can take. 
I am really shaken by this and I guess I just need someplace to spill my thoughts where someone is listening. I apologize if this post is a little all over the place. 

I woke up the morning after and didn’t know where my phone was, so I had no clue what time it was. I was wearing a sweater inside out and backwards and underwear, but thank fucking Christ I was in my own bed. I immediately felt super off and i couldn’t remember how I got home, when I left the bar, when I changed clothes, or anything. I’ve been very drunk before, as most dumb 21 year olds do, but this was different from anything I’ve ever felt. It didn’t feel like the nights events were hazy and the more I thought through it the memories would come. This felt like a black curtain was dropped in my mind after a certain point in the night. The last thing I remember is my roommate and I going to the bar for one more drink (only our third) and to close the tab. Everything after this is gone. 

We had briefly hung out with some older guys (like 27-29) in a quiet area in the first bar and we think these are the men who must’ve drugged us. We shared a shot they brought back (and suspiciously didn’t want to drink). I know this was so dumb. We know better and I honestly can’t explain why we took this drink from them. They were nice and we were too trusting I guess. Later on we noticed two of them whispering and looking at us so we went to the bathroom and decided to just leave and go to another bar because we were creeped out. We left them without saying goodbye and I honestly think this saved us. If we had stayed or let them know where we were going then they would’ve been near us when the drugs hit and been able to easily get us home with them. Not long after going to the next bar is when the curtain in my memory drops. From what I learned the next day from a girl I had added on Snapchat, we were super messy all of a sudden and her and her guy friend took care of us. They got us an Uber and took us home, making sure we got into our beds okay. At this point I have no choice but to take her at her word, I gotta believe they didn’t do anything weird to us because if I start thinking about what anyone could’ve done to us that night I feel fucking terrified. 

The kicker is, my roommate is doing fine... She’s gone back to the bars both nights since and I don’t know how. I’m terrified and I feel super violated. But now I’m starting to feel like maybe I’m over reacting. 

Another thing is I feel like I really can’t tell my mom. She was sexually assaulted when she was younger and I think she’d jump right to the worst conclusion. I also just feel like I’ve chosen to believe I wasn’t assaulted even though I have no way of knowing, and if my mom tries to bring up the subject... I don’t know. I’m scared. 

I guess I’m just looking for advice on how to move past this or support maybe? I’m missing my mom and I don’t have many close female friends I feel like I can talk to about this beside my roommate. 

TLDR: My roommate and I were roofied. We got away from the guys who did it, but I’m having a hard time dealing with the complete loss of memory. My roommate seems to be just fine and I am not. Can’t tell my mom because of her past trauma.",37

Today someone did something wrong with the laundry and left a glass in the garbage disposal, which he ran and then broke glass into the sink. I did neither of these things, but he was going on about how ""none of these fucking idiots know how to do anything right, this is why i don't respect any one of you"" and because silently I rolled my eyes at the usual shit, he got real mean towards me in particular and I finally snapped that ""Shit like this is why I have never respected you"" and basically it ended up escalating like I thought and ended with shit along the lines of my dad saying ""you could be dead to me and it would hurt you alot more than me"" and I said so calmly in my customer service voice with the coldest smile  ""are you sure about that?""

Some of us volunteer because its ""what we have always wanted to do"". 

Some of us say ""fuck you Im not doing that"".

Some of us, like me, are sitting on the fence with LOTS to consider:

Like, how can a couple actually afford to have a baby, afford its healthcare, things, childcare, education, extra-curriculars, etc, etc. on middle-class incomes without living in indefinite debt?

How can a couple bring a new human into THIS world. The overpopulated one that is going to face so much environmental turmoil. The one that is soon-to-be suffocating with too many parts per million of carbon in the air; acidified oceans; wildfires; super-storms; droughts; plastic pollution; super-bugs, etc, and so forth. 

How can a couple confidently raise a human in the tech world, without constant concern that their wellbeing is always at stake?

How can you go from being just ""you two"" to ""you three, or more"" & let go of that life you've always known & adopt one you know nothing about? And all that comes with that like: 

becoming friends with your kids friend's parents (yuck).   


Or getting over the fact that you've never loved sports, never watched them, think they are a total waste of space/time, and find out your kid is obsessed with them all & wants to play them all & you sit front row? 

Or the worst case: you raise a kid to love the planet, respect it, and it turns out to be a earth-exploitive asshole that wants to rally with Trump. 

How do you face all that psychological roadblock & get pregnant & just live in the fairy-tale fifties where women love everything about their pregnancy & motherhood & completely ignore or let go of the actual real shit of being a human on Planet Earth? 

How do you look into a child eyes, and honestly dont think ""I might have done the wrong thing here - on their part"". I get the personal satisfaction of being a mother. All the love, cuddles, bonding, blah, blah, blah. But what about them? How do you think past all that & just....do it?

The one time I was with my son I talked to him in the parking lot for a couple minutes and he said something that made me wonder if he like me but it was one of those things that he could've meant something by or not. I was walking by myself the other evening and got back to my car after the sun had set, it was dark. He was sitting in his car, he said hello and made some comment of my son not being there so I made sure to casually say my husband had him just incase. His reaction told me that there was perhaps a possiblity liked me or had some kind of intention. I never intentionally tried to give him the wrong idea. 
He asked if I knew about navigating with a compass I said I know how to read North and south, east and west but that's it. I don't know how to use the numbers on the compass, he asked if I wanted to know I said okay. He quickly showed me how to use them. In hindsight I really should not have said yes, but I did genuinely want to know. Anyways, the creepy part was after he started talking about the north star and using it if I didn't have a compass and he tried to point to the big Dipper because apparently that is where the north star is but could not see it well because of trees and asked if I had time to walk down the trail (it was dark) to see if we could see the stars better. I said no. That caught me off guard. I think he might have been a bit offended and said that it was probably a good idea because he wasn't trustworthy, which was I think an attempted joke. When he asked if I wanted to walk on trail to try and see the stars better it just creeped me out, I haven't gone back there. Is my imagination taking this and turning it into something it's not or does it legitimately seem creepy?

Not sure what to do or where to go from here.,0,dnveap,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dnveap/im_in_a_bad_situation_and_i_was_sexually/,9,1572221053.0,"A few days ago I was sexually assaulted. I’m 36, young looking, and I’ve been working as a stripper since I was 27. The first guy I talked into a lap dance said he had to go to the bathroom about 2 minutes into the song, so I said, sure, come back and we can finish. He comes back and I climbed on his lap and felt... something disgusting. He had cut a hole in his pants, wasn’t wearing underwear, and I immediately got up and saw that I had been grinding directly on his dick. I got up, grabbed my stuff- except for my phone, which he stole, and told the bar tender what had happened between my panicked sobbing. I called the cops and filled a police report- when the cop came to the bar to talk to me, he took me outside- alone- and took my statement while standing over me as people walked by, staring at me. I was shaking and crying and alone. 
I was so worried about telling my boyfriend what had happened... he already hates that I work at a strip Club and has shamed me many times through many fights about why I won’t let him come in and see what I do. For some reason he won’t just listen to me when I tell him what I do, and I don’t want him there. Ever. And he says I’m hiding who I really am by not allowing him to see me at work. He’s jealous and won’t listen when I say no. 
We also live together. When I first moved in, he really seemed to have it all together, financially. But now he works at a grocery store for 13 an hour, our rent is a lot more than he makes in a month, I desperately want to quit- the thought of going back there is almost as traumatic a thought as what happened- and now I feel so completely stuck. I don’t have health insurance, I don’t have a friend who lives here I can turn to, and I don’t know what to do. 
When I told my boyfriend what happened, I also told him that I quit and I can never go back there... but he spent all day yesterday laying in bed, being depressed and telling me about how much credit card debt he’s in, asking me if this assault is going to change our sex life, and berating me for telling him that I don’t think I can quit. He said he knew that I wasn’t telling the truth when I said I could never go back there. But what am I supposed to do? I don’t have savings, I don’t have enough for rent. I’m having nightmares and forcing myself to have sex with him, even though all I want to do is crawl into a hole and never come out. What do I do?",0

So I’ve (22F) been having a really abnormal experience with my period lately and I would really appreciate some insight.

So the story starts last year when I was in the hospital for a suspected ruptured ovarian cyst. Got a CT scan, transvaginal ultrasound, cervical swab, pelvic ultrasound, blood work, everything came back normal except my blood work that showed I had alleviated levels of WBC which made the doctor’s suspect the ruptured ovarian cyst. I was in the hospital for two days while they monitored me and because I was having a lot of pain, then discharged. Everything returned to normal until the beginning of this year. 

I’ve always had heavy periods but, for the last year my periods have gotten a lot more severe and heavy. I would get really bad cramps, before, after and during and I experienced ovulation pain. I went to the doctor countless times, did ultrasounds, blood work. Everything normal. One ultrasound indicated that I had some fluid in my pelvic area, doc said it’s inflammation but it’s like non-specific and not really a cause for concern. 

Come August I had my last regular period. I got the cramps but, nothing, no blood. I got a family doctor, went back. I did an ultrasound and it showed that I had a follicular cyst on my left ovary. He said we’ll watch it. September was the same, no period except in addition to the cramps, I started to get discharge with like, I guess some old blood in it because it was dark brown. Went back to the doctor and did another ultrasound, my cyst was gone this time.

My doctor decided that I probably have some hormone imbalance (I am overweight) and prescribed me birth control to help regulate my period. The birth control is the generic Alesse 28 so Alysena 28. 

Now, I’m 12 days into the pill and holy shit. I can’t stop bleeding. At first it was moderate spotting but now it’s like full-on hemorrhaging. 
Probably like the same as the worst day of my period. But I also keep passing those blood clots so I have REALLY bad cramps. Probably the worse cramps ever. Like bed rest cramps. I don’t know if the severity has something to do with the fact that I’ve missed two periods.

I don’t know what to do. I’m going to go back to my doctor this week and get a referral for an OB-GYN. If anyone could provide any insight I would really appreciate it.",1

When I was 9, there was this man married to my mum's cousin who gave me the creeps. I remember him getting hard when I had to sit with him on the front seat of the car and him holding me down when we kids were playing and kissed me forcefully, slobbering all over my cheek.
 I definitely didn't want to tell anyone but this came up when I refused to talk to him once on the phone. I told my mum the reason and she goes ""wow that's crazy. You should have told us that before"" but she went on staying on good terms with him as he's family and I didn't care much for it until there were times when he would congratulate me on some achievement or something like that and I had to reply calling him a respectful term in my language. There were a few times I bought it up but my mum, caring about family ties, brushed me off. She got really annoyed when I once bought it up and yelled at me saying I should have done something about it. I screamed I was nine but she told me I was giving her a headache.
  This (I turned 21) birthday, he texts me in the family group and wishes me. My mum tells me that I should thank him but I refused. I told her to type it herself and she tells me it's me being difficult but does it anyway. I feel angry and haven't been (mentally) feeling well since. I tell at my family for no reason and the only person I could talk to is my therapist but she's on vacation. My best friend just ignores me and tells me she has problems of her own and doesn't want to feel like my therapist. 
  Yesterday, I had a fight with my brother when I yelled at my mum for showing me a post about how kids kids should be obedient. That talk went to him telling me that I have had an easy life and that women my age used to have kids in the past and be fine. So we started talking about feminism and he told me I was playing the victim and when I told him I have been sexually assaulted several times, he says it happens to everyone and I shouldn't whine about it. 
  I am so angry and have been isolating myself. I just thought I would share. Maybe I will feel less alone.",37

I have no idea if this is the right sub, but I would love some support on this.

My mom is bipolar with hoarding tendencies. She buys thousands of dollars worth of things online that she doesn't need and never uses. Why? She likes getting mail each week. For example, she bought 100 plastic photo frames, 1000 keychain rings, etc. Instead of her wasting her and my dad's hard-earned money, I have started to send her weekly letters in the mail. In exchange, she has deleted her Ebay account and no longer shops online.

Sometimes I forget or the week gets away from me. I feel utterly guilty about this since she is waiting for the mail and checks it every day. Is there any online service or anything I should know about to assist me with this project?

Any suggestions are helpful. Thank you!",11

For a bit of background, I was sexually abused as a child by one person, and emotionally abused by several others. 

The sexually abusive person admitted to their abuse and told me to keep quiet about it because they knew of the repercussions. (they are now in prison)

The emotionally abusive people, however, never seemed to be aware of their actions. They were never just ""being"" mean on occasion, their *personalities* and *entire existence* was just mean. I called one person out, literally saying ""you're being abusive,"" after I learned of the meaning of the word myself. They clapped back saying ""this isn't abuse, this is discipline."" This in no way justifies their actions; they just never seemed to be aware that what they were saying was very damaging. 

Is there a sense of awareness in abusers? I would really like to know.",19
Advice needed on rejecting a guy friend who won’t back off after I’ve already told him no,34,dngidx,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dngidx/advice_needed_on_rejecting_a_guy_friend_who_wont/,25,1572137877.0,"I have a male friend (Josh) that I’ve known since last semester. We had one class together and only talked a little bit. He’s a nice guy, we just weren’t close. I ended up having a class with him again this semester, which, again, we’re kinda friends so it’s nice to know someone in my class, but by no means are we close. 

Josh and I have spoken a little bit more over snapchat this semester as opposed to last semester, but it’s because I’ve missed class a bit more and I ask for notes/what I missed in class. Recently I had noticed he was getting a little flirty, but I made sure not to reciprocate/flirt back. 

The other day he passed me in the hall and he said hi to me as he walked by and he grabbed my hip. I’m super uncomfy with guys that I don’t know well grabbing me unexpectedly, but it was in passing so I didn’t have a chance to say anything. That evening he texted me and told me he “didn’t know what he was doing” and hasn’t ever dated before so to tell him if he was going too fast or too slow. 

It was like a full record scratch stop for me. I hadn’t expressed any interest in him and I don’t know where he got the idea that we were a thing. I reminded him (he knew this beforehand) that I’m currently seeing two guys casually as FWB and I don’t want a relationship right now. I only recently got out of a long one and I don’t want to jump back into one. I told him I was sorry but that I needed to be blunt because I believe honest communication is best. I thought that would be the end of it. 

Since then he’s: told me he wants to have sex with me, told me he’s masturbated thinking about me, called me babe, cutie, and keeps sending me heart emojis. And the real kicker is that he openly told me that he has anger issues and physically hurts people when he’s mad! That’s a HUGE red flag that I want to avoid at all costs. How do I get this to stop? I’ve told him I don’t want to date, he *knows* Im seeing/interested in OTHER people, yet he won’t stop. I don’t want to make him angry and I don’t want to ruin the entire friendship, seeing as we’re paired up a lot in class and are seated next to each other. I just want this whole thing to stop.

I think my mother made a profile for my dead ex-grandmother,3,dnp0nk,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dnp0nk/i_think_my_mother_made_a_profile_for_my_dead/,9,1572181253.0,"Not sure if this belongs here and it's probably more of a rant but here I go.

Here is some scattered context but relevant to the situation. I was sexually abused by my mother's adopted father. When we went to court, all of my mom's adopted family disowned us. My mother has a lot of mental issues, is a drug addict, and can be very verbally abusive. My mom also has a history of logging into other people's profiles and pretending to be them. This is something she has done since she has had very her first social media account. 

Like I said above my mom is verbally abusive and the next couple of sentences is what ended our relationship. She once said that she wishes I would have died instead of my brother. She also told me she wishes I had been aborted or that I was given to her adopted parents so my ex-grandfather could keep raping me. This wasn't the only time she has been verbally abusive but this was the last straw. I wasn't going to take anyone from her, so I cut off all communication and haven't talked to her in 2 years. Since then my mother has created several accounts to try and talk to me (she has to keep making new ones because I block them). Sometimes it's her saying she is sorry and she wants me back, and some are more abuse. One time she created an account for my deceased brother because she believed she would know what he would say and that he wouldn't want us fighting. This account was deleted about a week later. This morning I get another friend request but there is no profile picture and nothing on the profile except a few people on their friends list (some I know, some I don't). I think nothing of it but then I remember the name on the account. I know that name. It's the first and middle name of my deceased ex-grandmother. I'm not sure if my mom is aware that I know she is deceased. Later this evening I try to go back and check out the profile and there is no record of it anymore. I'm pretty sure this was my mom trying to create another account. Part of me is shocked and another part isn't.",3
Being Child-Free and Working in Education: A Rant,25,dngw0n,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dngw0n/being_childfree_and_working_in_education_a_rant/,7,1572139503.0,"I had a job interview recently at a very small private school. The secretary gave me a tour of the school while the interviewer finished a few things up. 

The secretary is the type of middle-aged woman who has teased chin-length helmet hair, bright eighties eyeshadow, rhinestone earrings that match her bedazzled vest, and matching sparkly Keds. Out of the blue, she asks if I have any boys or girls of my own. Normally I would go into the niece and nephew song-and-dance to be polite, but for some reason, it annoyed me more than usual.

All I said was, ""I don't."" I didn't say it in a rude way, but I said it in a decisive, very final way. The poor woman was stunned and clearly didn't know what to say. At least she had the good sense to keep her mouth shut...either that or I shocked her speechless.

I get that the woman was just trying to find commonalities to relate to me, and for most woman, that's done through their children. What really annoys me is the idea that you need to have children to understand children. Or that if you don't have children, you must not like them. Or if you don't have children, you must not be good with them. 

Child-free women aren't kid-hating witches. You can enjoy kids, but not want them full-time. I love kids, and I really enjoy spending time with them. I also like teaching them. And I really love being the cool aunt! I also really like being able to send kids home at the end of the day, sleeping in on the weekends, and having time to pursue my own interests. 

Kids aren't an either-or: you don't have them or hate them. Life, and people, are more complicated than that. I know you guys get it...thanks for letting me blow off some steam!",25

I'd really like a woman's perspective on what I did wrong tonight, or if I should have stayed out of it completely.

I was eating a meal at a bar on a major bar street.  As I'm finishing up, I see a lone woman a few tables down from me is joined by a guy who greets her loudly with something along the lines of ""Hey, (name) it's been so long how come you never talk to me anymore.""  The girl mutters back a response, and the loud guy seats himself down next to her, and starts Creeping on her, big time.  Asking her ""don't you like me anymore"" and ""we should go to (this bar) together later"" that kind of thing.  The girl says loud enough for me to hear several tables away ""I don't like you."" and avoids eye contact with the guy.  The guy starts reaching across the table to grab her hand, and leans his head on her shoulder for a minute.  The girl seems to shut down completely, doing minimal interaction with him. 

Now, I'm an introverted dude, and about 10 years older than both of them, but it's pissing me off seeing this girl get creeped on.  So I pay my bill, and go over to the table and say something  to the girl along the lines of ""Sorry to bother you, but I saw this guy being creepy all the way over at my table, and I couldn't help notice how awkward and lame it was.  Is he bothering you?""  I don't touch the girl, just make eye contact trying to get a feel for the situation, she says ""It's fine, I'm ok.""

Creeper starts talking to me ""Hey man, where are you from,"" grabs my hand and shakes it, starts trying to talk to me, I'm not really listening to him.  I ask the girl again, ""Are you ok?"" She responds, ""I can handle it.""  Still dead eyes.  Still disengaged with everything.  This is a super public place, but creeper dude is starting to talk light shit about me, ""You ain't no Johney Depp you know"" while the girl is avoiding both our eyes, so I tell the girl enjoy your night and leave.  I hated leaving her in the awkward situation, but I felt like me being there was just making it worse for her.  I hate these creeper dudes, and want  to shut them down when I see them, if that makes me a white knight or sjw or whatever so be it.

I am slightly worried for my safety after being contacted by an old friend, if that's what you'd call it. Around 5 years ago, I would sext random men online out of boredom and low self-esteem. One of these men I continued chatting to for maybe a year. He knows my full name, but I don't think he knows my address. Anyway, he ghosted me, or so I thought. I got on meds (bipolar), got my shit together, got a stable boyfriend, and can't relate at all to who I was at that time. However, the guy messaged me again on Kik a month ago. Turns out he didn't ghost me, he was in *prison this whole time for trying to kidnap a drug dealer*. WTF?

So I explain that I'm happy he's doing better (he got out for good behavior) but I don't want to speak again. It seems like he had been fantasizing about this conversation while in prison, where I'd admire his progress and get on the next flight to wherever he was out of  love. He wasn't angry and communicated that he understood. However, two weeks after that, as well as a couple of days ago, he's messaged me again, with me saying every time that I don't want to speak to him.

The easy solution in my head is to delete the app. However, the only reason I respond is because this guy is some sort of felon and I'm absolutely scared if he stalks me or something. What do I do? Thanks everyone.",4

I’ve recently been through a break up from a relationship of 4 years. I went to my colleague for advice as he’s been like a big brother to me at work, also because of him having that male perspective. I’ve never seen him as anything else other than a friend and never intend to. We’re two completely different types of people. 

Since speaking to him about the break up, he’s been texting me and messaging me at work. He never really speaks to me in person, but has suggested for us to go and have a chat for a few minutes at work. Coming up to his birthday night out, he was texting me inappropriate things and offering me to stay at his - this offer soon escalated from staying in the spare room to being in his room... I declined and I’m glad I did because on the actual night out, I could feel his eyes on me most of the time and he would put his arm around me too. 

The day after the night out, he sent me messages about how good I looked and being suggestive again.

I’m quite a sensitive person, I suppose and I don’t like people invading my personal space like that. 

I’ve tried speaking to my manager about this and she said to keep and eye on it and to let her know if it carries on, as then she’ll take action... so, I don’t think she fully believed me. But I’ve also made two of my other colleagues aware of this too. 

What else can I do?

I’m still figuring out all the ways my abusive ex messed with my head,7,dnkjzb,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dnkjzb/im_still_figuring_out_all_the_ways_my_abusive_ex/,3,1572156367.0,"It’s been 4 years since I’ve even seen him, but even meeting someone with the same name sends me spiraling. We started dating my freshman year in college and he was my first “real” relationship.

I was a fairly sheltered kid in high school, I saw college as my opportunity to branch out. “Trevor” was great at the beginning, kind of a weird person like I was, but we had a group of friends that all got along. We were both crushing pretty hard and it didn’t take more than a couple weeks for us to start officially dating.

Looking back now I can see ALL of the red flags but at the time I didn’t know what was “normal” in a relationship. Almost immediately he would get jealous of me making any new friends/spending time with people other than him. I remember one particular time when I was about 10-15 minutes “late” meeting him in the cafeteria because I was... just outside the cafeteria chatting with friends waiting for him. He told  me I was rude, selfish, a buzzkill, etc.

All of my free time was spent with him and before I knew it  I didn’t have ANY other friends. I would try to talk about other people I saw, people in my classes, roommates, but every conversation was met with sullen sulking and one word responses. “So you had time to talk to so-and-so after class but you didn’t have time to study with me?” “Your lecture got done 20 minutes ago, where have you been?” Stuff like that.

Trevor’s emotional instability only got worse over time, he would go from a blind rage (not always at me, sometimes at classes or other people) to sobbing that he was a horrible person with no future. I did what a dutiful girlfriend was “supposed” to do, I comforted him, I held him, I talked him down. Reading the most subtle shifts in his mood became second nature to me. I entirely stopped taking care of myself in favor of taking care of him. 

Since he was my first relationship I had DEFINITELY never “been” with a guy before. We kissed and did hand stuff but it never went much past that. Until about 8 months into our relationship. We were in the back of his car cuddling/kissing/whatever and he kept pushing the idea of going further. I insisted that I wasn’t ready, but that only made him want it more. He left me sitting on the floor of his car and said we would just wait in his locked car until I changed my mind... or I could walk home. Surprise surprise, I changed my mind.

After that I essentially became his therapist/fleshlight. If he was horny then we would ABSOLUTELY fuck. No questions asked. I even hated riding in his car because it would ALWAYS turn into either a handy or road head. I can’t emphasize the ALWAYS enough. I was miserable but I was so far in denial I didn’t even realize I was miserable.

One moment in particular especially sticks out to me.. we were his dorm room watching tv one night while his roommate was out. He asked if I wanted to get it on while we had the room to ourselves, I responded that I wasn’t really in the mood. He said it ok, we watched another episode or so. Then out of nowhere he jumps up, quietly closes the door, locks it, and turns to face me. “Ok, flip over.” That’s all he said to me, just “flip over.” I stared at him like he was dumb so he flipped me over himself, undressed, and did his business. That was the first moment I realized what a fucking shit show this whole thing was.

And it still took me almost 7 months after that to leave him.

There are so many more instances of this guy fucking my life up. Whenever I talked about my goals/dreams that didn’t perfectly align with being his little housewife he would slap me across the face to “snap me out of it.” He told me my parents were manipulating me, that my friends were bad influences, that no one else was looking out for me.

The moment I realized I had to get out was one such situation. My sister wanted to hire me as her nanny over the summer in exchange for paying for a semester of my schooling. Only catch was it was on the Georgia coastline (I was thrilled). And he was LIVID when I told him. He wanted me to stay up north so I could visit him once a month for his internship. He was crying, he slapped me, he told me I was going to ruin his internship and as a direct result ruin his career. THATS when I decided “fuck this, I want to spend time with my sister.” I left his about two weeks later.

I could go into the harassing phone calls and texts, the stalking around campus, the rumors... but honestly I didn’t even care about all that. I refused to engage him and would routinely eat my lunch in the bathroom so he couldn’t get to me. 

It took years for me to even admit to myself that I had been abused, I brushed off most of what he did as us just not getting along.

There’s still so many subconscious things I’m unlearning from that relationship. Half of me hopes he got the help he CLEARLY needs, but the other stronger half of me hopes his life sucks and he’s a miserable shit.

Sorry for the long meandering post, I think I just had to get this off my chest. Bad relationships are no joke, friends.",7

I don't know what to do. Living with two cishet men is becoming a nightmare.,0,dnyf60,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dnyf60/i_dont_know_what_to_do_living_with_two_cishet_men/,20,1572234136.0,"Hi TwoXChromosomes! My husband and I moved in a friend's apartment about a month ago because we're moving out of the country soon and needed a place to crash in between.

It's very kind of our friend to let us crash, I am very grateful! I knew that our friend was not big on cleanliness so I don't hold him accountable for doing chores, after all it's his place so he does what he wants.

But my husband and I clearly like living in a clean, organized place. And yet, I seem to be the only one thinking about cleaning and tidying up the place. When we had our own place it was easier because we had a cleaning person that we paid for that (I was really grateful for that help), but now we don't anymore. And we fall again into these cliche shitty gender roles and I really hate it.

More context: our friend works a 9-5 job, I am a student in the middle of my big end-of-year project so I don't really have hours, and my husband is out of job for now. All he does all day is playing video games, which is fine because it's what he loves and I support it. But there is an imbalance in mental load. He clearly has 200% more time to do chores than I do and yet he never thinks about them if I don't remind him. Another thing is that he or his friend don't seem to mind that the place is an absolute mess and that everything is super dirty.

So let me ask: why is it every man I know (yes, every man, sorry), is less inclined to think about living in a clean and tidy home? It can't be genetic, and I know it's mostly education but how have women survived in these environments for so long? How have women put up with this for so long?

It makes me really sad to think that my relationship is also falling in that cliche and I am starting to ask myself questions. I am on the verge of packing my stuff and go to a (woman) friend's place, but at the same time we only have two more weeks left in current situation.",0

PTSD at a Halloween Party,0,dnvkhe,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dnvkhe/ptsd_at_a_halloween_party/,11,1572221789.0,"This post contains language, as I speak fluent in sailor.

I am seeking support, but I also would like to know if I was out of hand in all of this. I appreciate honesty. I'm trying to be the best version of myself by learning from my mistakes.

So, last night my boyfriend and I went to a Halloween party at one of his friend's house. These are all people that we have partied with before, so we know what to expect. Now, I love Halloween! I love the fact that we can dress up as whatever we want and have the opportunity to step outside ourselves for just a day. 

Now on to what happened

It's about 11:30 pm, and there is a knock at the door, some people come in and one of them is this beautiful woman. I notice her immediately as she has on a bathrobe and bunny ears. As my friend is greeting her (it had been a while since they had seen each other), she pulls off the robe and she is wearing a body harness with a thong and pasties. At this point, it is only myself, my friend and the 2 people who just walked into the room. I'm sitting in a chair, directly in the path of where they would walk through to get to the rest of the house. Well this woman did not greet me, I would have loved to introduce myself to her, but she didn't give me the opportunity. She stood there, made eye contact with me 3 separate times, but didn't say hi. What did she do instead? she walked past me and up to my boyfriend and this other guy, introduces herself and then completely disrobes, and is now standing practically naked in front of them.

My blood boiled, I could feel myself getting angry and all the blood rushed to my face. My friend, who was standing in front of me asks me if I am ok, to which I reply that no, I am not ok, I need to use the bathroom. My friend walked me to the bathroom in her room, where I sat and cried. How fucking disrespected I felt. A woman I had never met went up to my boyfriend and disrobed herself, after not introducing herself, or allowing me to. It felt like a slap to the fucking face!  I called for my boyfriend to come into the room with me. There have been situations where I've caught him with a wandering eye, which is normal for a human being, but when he came into the room, he could tell that I was upset about something, and I could tell that he knew what was up.

BF: hi babe, are you ok?

me: No. I'm assuming that woman came up and introduced herself to you, I also saw she took off her robe...""

(bf nodds head like he thinks he is in trouble or something)

me: I want to leave. (at this point im crying inconsolably) She made eye contact with me 3 times, walked right past me and didn't even bother to say hi. But she found the time to walk up to you and show you her body. I feel disrespected, and if you love me, you'll understand why I feel this way, and why we need to go.

BF: Of course babe, we'll go. I'm sorry youre feeling this way, but I love you.

for a few minutes, we both stand in the bathroom. HE hugs me and tells me he loves me while I cry and try to work through my anger.

I realized... I was feeling insecure as fuck. I felt like a potato. I have struggled with being overweight my entire life. In 2015 I ballooned to 250 lbs on a 5-foot 5-inch frame. I was previously in an abusive relationship where my abuser, who was obese himself, would say I was a fat bitch. Those words still echo in my mind. I may have lost 80 or so lbs, but when I look in the mirror I still see a 250lb Pluriphery, with 3 massive rolls on her tummy and really jiggly and chubby legs, and a chubby face. I suffer from body dysmorphia and this incident triggered my PTSD. 

So, as I was falling apart on the bathroom floor, half of me understood why I felt the way I did, and the other half of me was being cruel. ""you're fat because you eat like shit"" ,""you will never have a body like that"" ,""you are the most insecure piece of shit on this planet"" , ""do this shit again and he will leave you"" ""how fucking insecure are you that you feel threatened by another woman's bodily expression?"" ""LOL, you thought you looked good tonight"" I LOOKED AND FELT AMAZING LAST NIGHT! I thought I looked like a boss ass woman, but I didn't feel sexy. My body certainly had about 50  to 60 lbs to lose before I looked anything like her. ""you've busted your ass for 4 years and you're STILL not skinny"" SOme days im extremely kind to myself, but last night was one of the worse days I've had in a long while when it comes to body image.

After putting on my big girl pants, my boyfriend called for the uber/lyft. We were saying our goodbyes on our way out when the robed woman approached me. She introduced herself to me and asked me how I was doing. I saw this as the perfect opportunity to let her know that I did not appreciate what she did.

me: ""I'm not ok, actually. You walked right past me after introducing yourself to everyone else in the room, and then you walked up to my boyfriend and you disrobed, and that was a big fuck you to me""

(I'm trying to control my emotions and have a talk like a mature adult, but my knees and hands are shaking, and I can feel my body tense up as an adrenaline reaction. My emotions have always been too big for my body.)

Robed Woman (RW) : ""Well I'm sorry, I was saying hi to my friends that I haven't seen in a long time and I'm just so overwhelmed with everything""

Me: ""But you weren't overwhelmed enough to walk up to my boyfriend, whom you've never met before, and disrobe. Woman to woman, you should understand why that would piss anyone off. I don't think this would even be an issue if we had introduced ourselves to each other. Cuz right now youre just some random woman who showed her almost naked body to my boyfriend. I don't know of any woman who would stand for this.""

RW: ""Honestly, you're assuming that I'm oh so confident but I'm not. It took a lot for me to dress up this way. I don't think I should have to apologize, but I will because I did not say hi to you. I never had any ill intentions, so for that, I apologize.""

me: ""I just want you to know how you made me feel. I have no ill feelings toward you. In fact, I think you are extremely confident and powerful and so in control! I admire your fearlessness and am 100% in support of your look tonight. You are powerful, woman. Own it. I really would have just liked a hello. That's the only thing.""

we talked for maybe another minute more before the uber/lyft arrived. I made sure to give her a hug because the last thing I wanted was for there to be bad vibes. So the night ended on a better note than anticipated.

My boyfriend through all of this has been so understanding and patient. He understands where my insecurities come from, and why I have a hard time getting past it. I don't want to be this way, but years of neglect, emotional, mental and verbal abuse have left me scarred. The only difference between who I was then and who I am now lies in the fact that I KNOW why I am feeling the way I am, and I analyze and process the way I feel now, instead of lashing out.

I need to learn to love and accept myself for the way I am. When I die, I'm gonna feel I wasted so much fucking time worried about the way that I look, when its not the most important thing in the world. Looks fade, skin sags, hair goes white, its a fact of life. Why have I clung on to words and phrases that do not represent me or serve a positive purpose to me? What can I do to help love myself, rolls, cellulite and jiggly legs and all? I know I sound totally neurotic crying over a missed greeting, but her actions afterward triggered my PTSD, and that is never a fun thing to experience at a party when everyone is either drunk or on some drugs that make them immune to sadness. I didn't want to bring the party vibe down, which is why I locked myself in the bathroom for 20 minutes.

Am I out of line?

I feel I made a fool of myself, but my feelings are valid. 

Again, I am seeking support and some feedback.

I held her hand and told her I'd believe her over anyone else, and that I'd do everything in my power to support her. But I didn't tell her that ever since we met, I had a instinctual feeling that she had been molested as a child. And I didn't tell her that meeting a specific member of her family only heightened my suspicions. Should I have? Should I have years ago? She has been slowly piecing together her childhood and I've feared suggesting something that would become her reality, even if my suggestion was wrong.

&#x200B;

What else should I be doing right now? I've tried to convince her to try therapy and she's always dismissed it as a waste of money. This morning I contacted some family and was able to guarantee funding for a therapist, and everyone said there was no time limit on it (I love my family). How do I bring any of this up again? The only time she is ever able to talk anywhere near this topic, she's been drunk. She hasn't been able to handle a similar conversation sober. Do I get her drunk again? That feels so exploitative but other obvious plans aren't coming to me. How many hundreds of things have I not thought of yet that I should be considering?

How do you become comfortable with healthy boundaries (accepting them and enforcing them).,6,dni0w0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dni0w0/how_do_you_become_comfortable_with_healthy/,7,1572144660.0,"I'll preface this by saying I don't know if my previous partner had BPD, NPD, or a personality disorder in general. However, the situation was toxic and It screwed up how I give attention, interpret a lack of it in others, and other boundaries.

A bit of background, i had moved to another country primarily for this guy, though he was not the defining reason. At the time I had no experience whatsoever with relationships and/or sex. He was incredibly affectionate and trustworthy and provided a pressure-free environmentor so I thought. I had met his closest friends, family, ex-fiancee, spent christmas at his family home, and did a trip or two together. There was always this period of lovebombing where he would give me intense attention and passion. At the same time, if I couldn't have sex with him (I have vaginismus which was undiagnosed at this time), he would tell me of other women that were good in bed or suggest sleeping with other men to ""loosen up"" or buy me sex toys and list it as a gift for me rather than a gift for himself. This was someone who had no problem holding my hand or being affectionate in public around friends or family with me, but at the same time took pride in having a revolving door of partners and letting me know in subtle ways (i.e ""spending the night with a friend""). It was like he wanted a girlfriend, but the freedom to sleep with whomever and not explain that from the beginning. Anyway this toxic situation ended after 4 years, but this being my first experience warped my view of what healthy boundaries were and are. I had dated after that, but for me the guys were just there as rebounds and I had no emotional attachment to them. They were nice and though I like to date one person at a time, I felt no obligation to them or thought of them as anything more than a friend. I took time off of romance and focused on myself, analyzed what were the red flags that I ignored and told myself that I was not 100% to blame for putting so much energy over 4 years into a man who couldn't love me.

I moved to a different country and met someone who I had a connection with and I may have destroyed it already. It could be because of the vaginismus (since piv is difficult if im able to have it, I feel secure and safe with that person) or the previous experience, but I put so much weight into this one person and ended up being stifling and needy, which I'm normally not. I was used to having someone who if I catered enough to, if I changed myself enough, he would be there and shower me with massive amounts of attention. With this current guy, he isn't hot or cold or saying positive things and behaving the opposite. Unfortunately over something as innocuous as canceling something planned, I broke down crying. In hindsight being able to say no when you can't do something is great. But I got so used to having my no's being manipulated into yes's that I took it directly against me or that I wasn't good enough or someone that could have a relationship with. I'm over the first person I listed and I realize that his actions were really manipulative, but I don't know what I can do to get over this baggage and warped view of relationships and avoid also being manipulative. I know in the long run therapy would be great for this. However, at the moment I cannot see someone until I understand the healthcare system here. I am an independent person and I don't want to be clingy or jealous, or put too much attention on one person when I feel a connection. Honestly this is all rambling, but any advice would be great. I think moving to a new country and not having friends here yet is compounding the problem and I just need to find a routine where I can feel support. 

I realize now that I was codependent and I desperately want to get out of that cycle. Additionally, my learned behavior of accepting manipulation and also being manipulative needs to change. How do I set up this framework so I can stop myself from perpetuating both? And lastly, how do I talk about this issue with someone I have feelings before but right now it's in this casual stage? I'm really trying hard to work on open communication without being vague or overwhelming",6
22F student dating 27M guy- do we pay equally on dates?,0,dnp3sm,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dnp3sm/22f_student_dating_27m_guy_do_we_pay_equally_on/,11,1572181814.0,"Hi ladies:

To start off, thanks for clicking on my post and caring enough to read about a complete stranger's story with the intention to share your insights. I think that's an immense act of kindness that often goes unappreciated. So there you go. 

I'm a 22 year old student, giving my second go at university studying what I really like studying. Before I started in this second program, I made a promise to myself that I would focus on my academics first and foremost without being distracted with working or dating. But as you would know, life doesn't always pan out as planned and I recently went back to working a part time job to help pay my bills and also to talking to this lovely man.

For the context of the story, we first met 4 years ago in 2015, when we were 18 and 23. We'd clicked quite intensely on our first date but the timing just wasn't right for us and we hadn't talked to each other since 3 weeks ago when we crossed paths again. So 4 years later now in 2019, I'm still in school while he's quite successful running his own business.

I enjoy his company, and hanging out with him is lovely. We've only gone on three dates now but it feels like we've known each other for years (which, to be fair, isn't entirely false).  He's kind, smart, AND funny- I'm happy when I'm with him.

The only problem that came up is something of a financial nature; we go on more ""adult"" dates, which means on every date we spend more than the amount of money I make during my whole shift at my minimum wage job. And although I'm sure he'd be happy to cover for all our dates, I'm not comfortable letting him do that so I've offered to pay my share, which he has gladly accepted.

Now, I'm all about the independence and self-sufficiency of women, but with me being a student and him being a business owner, we're functioning on different levels financially. I don't know about nor am I particularly interested in his financial situation, but he did just teasingly showed off to me that he bought a condo downtown (we live in Toronto). If I were working a real job making real money, I would be more lenient with spending money on dates, but I'm just not in that position yet. 

So, I'm in a bit of a predicament; I like him, he likes me, and we want to see where it goes, but at this pace I don't see this being financially sustainable for me. How do I go about discussing this with him?",0

I was on my way to work but I had to stop at the liquor store for cigarettes . it's on the corner and I was coming from across the street through a gas station parking lot. I noticed that there was a guy at the red light staring at but nothing was alarming, yet. 

By the time I got to the other end of the gas station, the car had pulled into the liquor store parking lot. I walked past his car thinking, oh he's just a drunk, not necessarily a weirdo. So I went in and he still was sitting in his car.

And as soon as I left the store, he put his car in gear. So that's when I really let him see that I saw him. I kind of threw my arms up with a fuck off face. He pulled out to go the same way as me. 

Now I'm back in the gas station parking lot and he drives past me on the road, but very slowly. Then he took the next turn in the direction I was walking. As soon as he was out of sight I backtracked to the gas station, ran inside and called my boss. 

I told her someone is following me there's no way I'm going to let them see where I'm going. She offered to come get me but I was so freaked out I forgot to tell her where I was even at ( less than 1/8 mile from my work!)

I'm suddenly experiencing flashbacks of something that happened almost a year ago.,7,dnhd8r,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dnhd8r/im_suddenly_experiencing_flashbacks_of_something/,4,1572141646.0,"Hi, I (22F) don't really post on reddit often but I guess I need to vent and I don't feel comfortable talking about this with my friends/family. TW; non-consensual sex.

Last year my then-boyfriend and I were going through a rough patch. I was unsure if I wanted to be with him and he was aware I was having doubts about us, so we had some difficult conversations at the time, since he wanted us to stay together. One day we were doing some after-sex cuddling in bed, having one of those difficult conversations. I could sense that he was hurt about me considering ending things. We were having some friends over later that day and he was trying to feel me up to have sex again before our friends would arrive. I didn't want to and I wasn't really responsive to his touch but he kind of kept trying to have sex and I didn't say no, although I said things like ""let's get dressed instead maybe, our friends will be here soon."" But I also didn't want to outright reject him since I could tell I had already hurt him in our previous conversation. I was bothered by his pushiness, and remember thinking: if I just play along at least it'll be over sooner and we can just get dressed and wait for our friends to arrive. So I guess I kind of consented but I felt pressured into it and I certainly didn't enjoy it.

After he was done, I got up immediately, got dressed and went to the bathroom. I clearly remember him saying ""I hope I wasn't being too pushy"" as I left the room, so he knew something was up. We had some time left before our friends would arrive so when I came back into the bedroom I started playing video games without acknowledging him. I wasn't saying anything or reacting to his touches, I was silently and apathically playing the game, I guess. After a while my ex said ""Can we please talk about this?"" and I said ""I just didn't enjoy that,"" and he immediately burst out crying. He kept apologizing, saying he felt horrible for doing that. I remember being so confused and unsure of what to feel and yet feeling so empty and trying to wrap my head around as to why he would keep insisting even though he knew I didn't want to. But I ended up holding him, reassuring him it was just unfortunate miscommunication, we could just forget about it, etc.

I broke up with him a few weeks later. At the time I didn't want to think about what happened and I didn't tell anyone about it, nor did I feel the need to. So that brings me to today. I don't know why but for a few weeks I've been suddenly experiencing flashbacks of that day and feel panicky and I start crying whenever I think about it. I tense up and I keep reliving how horrible it felt in that moment. The weird thing is, I don't think my ex is a bad person. He didn't mean to hurt me and he was genuinely sorry about it. And there's people that have been through much, much worse so I don't feel justified in feeling so strongly about something that happened long ago, which may have well been just an unfortunate misunderstanding. I'm not sure I blame him for what happened even, at least not as much I also blame myself for not communicating clearer, if I would have had said ""no"" directly, it probably wouldn't have happened but I just felt that I needed to let it happen and it would be over soon and we wouldn't be fighting at least. I guess I still don't understand why he was so pushy about it when he surely was aware I was hesitant. 

Am I overreacting? Why was I ""okay"" with what happened for months after, but now I'm feeling terrible about it and reliving it constantly? Has anyone dealt with a similar situation? I could use some outside perspective.",7
How can I stop letting the number on the scale control my life?,2,dnle8w,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dnle8w/how_can_i_stop_letting_the_number_on_the_scale/,10,1572160451.0,"Hi! Since January I've lost about 20 pounds, which is great and needed since my BMI says obese, but certainly not enough for me. It's honestly a drop in the bucket. I was almost 200, now I am down to 179ish pounds. I'm trying to get to 120 at the most. I hate to even think about how I looked then if I still look this big now, but anyway, I am struggling to stay mentally ""sane"" when it comes to my weight. I've already been dealing with severe depression (for nearly a decade now), and any increase (even just a couple pounds) on the scale causes me to breakdown. I've been getting slightly better, at least I think, with restricting my calories considering I am a couch potato but I still really struggle when I don't see any results from that. About half of the weight has come off since going plant-based, and I've been suppressing my appetite by eating flavors that don't mix well. 

&#x200B;

But admittedly, sometimes I do end up letting my hunger win and snacking during late hours. As I mention before, I am trying to help that by eating things that repulse me so I can lose my appetite.  I feel guilty with every bite of food I take nowadays, especially since I know that what is standing between me and even a bit of happiness is my weight.

&#x200B;

It doesn't help that I've started to become more interested in fashion and trying to dress better for myself, but then realizing that I won't ever look like the women I want to look like, partially because of my size, and also because of my body type in general. For the first time in years, I started looking at ""thinspo"" again online and it in general makes me feel even worse. Everyday when I wake up, it's like a routine. I go to the bathroom, check out my stomach, suck it in, pull on my fat, check the size of my thighs, then go to the scale to see if I somehow magically lost any weight overnight. I've done the same thing since I was in junior high about 10 years ago. I haven't worn anything that would show my legs since I was in like, 4th grade, but I'd certainly love to, I just can't yet. Not until I reach my goal weight. 

I hate that I let myself get this fat but here I am. I try to keep myself occupied so I don't think about food but it doesn't work.

I won't even take my antidepressants because I am scared of the weight gain that may come if my appetite increases even more. I'm sure you can imagine how annoyed my therapist will be when I tell her that once again, for yet another reason, I won't take my antidepressant. 

I understand that weight loss is calories in, calories out. I am not comfortable with going to the gym until I am skinnier. Talk about a bad cycle, right haha? Hell, I'm not even comfortable leaving the house half the time because I hate being the fattest one in sight.

I guess what I am asking for help with is how I can stop letting my weight take over my life. I was able to just let it go for a while. I wasn't happy, but I didn't cry about it every night. But now it's like those negative feelings came back with a vengeance.

I don’t even know where to begin. It’s almost 4 am where I am and I’m sitting on my bed, alone crying. My husband is on the living room couch, where he’s been sleeping for about a month now. That didn’t start with like a fight or anything. He would just fall asleep out there watching tv every once in awhile and it became more and more frequent. I didn’t even think of it as a bad thing, really. I didn’t really notice consciously how lonely I’ve become in here by myself. That isn’t really the point of this, however.

I suppose I best provide a little backstory here. I’ve been diagnosed with major depressive disorder (my first diagnosis came at 14 and at that time it was thought I was bipolar but it’s been years since I had any kind of high point that could be considered “manic” so that diagnosis went out the window). In the last 5 years or so, I have had absolutely no interest in doing anything other than reading. This includes any kind of house work. I have 2 dressers that sit empty and all my clothes are piled up around the bedroom. I have a fooseball table that’s completely covered in hoodies. Empty pizza boxes are stacked up top an old microwave on my kitchen table. The microwave needs to go to the thrift store which is only a block away but yet... it still sits there. My husband has gotten sick of it. I don’t blame him. I’ve gotten sick of it. And yet I can’t make myself do anything about it. I don’t know why. 

Tonite it all blew up because our roof started leaking. We rent an apartment and the landlord has known for over a year that the roof needed to be fixed. Last week an animal had gotten into the space between the roof and the ceiling. There isn’t any way to access this space from inside. My husband was going to climb up onto the roof to try and trap it but we’d need to borrow a ladder. I’ve called the landlord over and over again because the animal wakes us up at dawn and it’s quite annoying. Normally, you’d probably just find someplace else to live, right? But we really cannot afford it. Not just the cost of moving but the rent itself. We’re unlikely to find someplace near as cheap. 

Anyway, the leaking roof set him off. He started yelling at me about all the stuff everywhere. Then, he started throwing stuff. I understand his anger and his frustration but I don’t know what to do about it. I know our relationship isn’t healthy. He has this persecution complex or something. A favourite phrase of his is “If that we’re *me*, I’d be getting in shit for that...” Like, he thinks everything is harder, more difficult for him or unfair. It’s hard to put into words, especially now. He also does this thing where he complains about random people (ie, his mom, who he hasn’t had any contact with in over 10 years) but I know he’s really talking about me. Then, he says things like “I don’t know why I even bother talking, no one listens to me anyway”. When he’s like this, I’ve learned to not say anything because anything I say just makes matters worse. But if I don’t say anything, I’m not listening to him. 

Sorry for this long post, Redditors. I don’t know why I’m posting to this. To vent maybe? I literally don’t have anyone IRL to talk to. Depression and agoraphobia don’t allow me to make any friends. I don’t know what to do. I seriously hate what my pathetic life has become but I don’t know what to do about it. I apologize for any spelling or grammar errors.

A neighbor called the cops, and my ex went into a psych ward for a month. I visited every day, called as often as I could, put up with the endless guilt tripping when I couldn't.

After that, they came home. They were supposed to get mental health support- they didn't. It was just me, trying to be their full time unpaid carer/therapist while also trying to tamp down on the massive trauma I had suffered, hold down a full time job, and train a new intern (it's her first job, and she's needed a *lot* of my time and attention). 

Through it all, my manager was super supportive and understanding, giving me time off for the first few days after ex's breakdown, switching my hours so I could go visit the hospital, and signposting a bunch of resources. My ex was too anxious to leave the house- which was fine, except they'd also threaten to kill themself whenever I left it too, including for work or even just to go get some milk from the shops.

Eventually I snapped, and after a breakdown where I almost checked myself into the psych ward, I broke up with my ex. And that, ironically, was where my troubles at work began.

After about a week, my manager started picking up on all the things I'd slipped up on, having not made a big deal of them at the time, including mistakes my intern had made while I was off sick having the above breakdown.

And just to be clear- if she'd said ""I know you're struggling, but I need you to shape up,"" I'd have understood. But no, apparently a few months is enough to get over a hideously traumatic series of events, and the breakdown of a relationship that had lasted almost a decade.

I just feel absolutely floored right now, and torn between the spite-fuelled part of me that wants to show manager I absolutely *can* do this job (before this year, she was saying I was the only reason she was still sane), and the battered, exhausted part that wants to throw my hands up and call it a day. I'm just... so tired, and I really don't need someone telling me how I should be feeling about a sequence of events that has left me with PTSD.",3

So, I’m 23 and we’ll we had an argument long story short, my dad has a big acceident I went into depression. And didn’t really talk to her much or at all, I was too caught up in my own worries 

I’ve always had depression and I’ve never known how best to deal with it till I got therapy. Before that I used to turn to her for advice on boys or issues etc. We were best of friends. 

Until all of a sudden she started saying I wasn’t a good friend etc etc, I asked too much of her and didn’t talk much mainly due to my depression. Anywho, since I’ve been with my bf she’s literally BARELY spoken to me.  Messaged me on my birthday in April we spoke a bit in May and since I haven’t said a word or heard a word. 

I went to Mexico with my bf and all his mates and we had a really good time and she watched all of my snapchat stories and now I think she either ignores them or has me on mute and I think it’s some form of jealousy. 

Anyway, I’m wondering. I’m not one for conflict and I’m not sure if it’s worth a convo or not. How would I approach this as right now I’m now best pleased with the way she acts, it’s fine to not talk all the time but I made a lot of the effort after we had strong words and we spoke as normal.

We’re parked in front of a football field in a suburban area, houses line the street. I figure they’re on the way to a house party. I consider winding up the windows but think to myself ‘that’s ridiculous, why would they bother us? I’m just overthinking things’ so I sit there in silence focusing on my food and my boyfriend, facing away from the group of guys. 

Then out of nowhere I hear ‘can I pat your dog?’ And I jump and turn to see one of the guys with his head in my window.

I’m 19 years old and in need of some advice right now.

I was out partying with a close friend who I used to be madly in love with at the time. I’ll refer to him as T, he’s 20 years old. We had a few drinks with some other friends, it was a great night. (We are legal age in my country, don’t worry)

At some point it became clear though that I had drunk *too* much. T offered to take me to his place, because he and the rest of my friends were worried about me being alone in the condition I was in. So I agreed, partly because they were right, and partly because I liked the idea of sleeping at his place. I had a crush on him, after all, and I trusted him 100%.

When we were at his place, he gave me a shirt and shorts to sleep in, and left his room while I was changing. He said he’d come back after I was done and sleep on the opposite side of the bed. I was okay with that. So, I changed, crawled into bed and immediately passed out.

Later that night I woke up again. There was a hand under my shirt. He was fondling my boobs while I was sleeping. I was startled for a few seconds, but then I started to move to make it clear that I was awake, and he quickly stopped. I was sooo confused after that. But I fell asleep again.

The next morning it seemed like nothing happened. He never mentioned anything either. All he said was that he couldn’t remember much of the night before. So i decided to just forget about it.

This happened about 5 months ago, and honestly I feel kind of disgusted by it now. I don’t have a crush on him anymore, but we’re still close friends and I see him regularly because we have the same group of friends. Our friendship means a lot to me, but I still get upset when I think about this incident.

At the same time I feel bad about holding a grudge, because he was drunk too, and maybe he really doesn’t remember what happened? I also had a crush on him at the time and wanted to sleep at his place (although not in a sexual way) so idk if I even have the “right” to be mad.

We weren't having issues and rarely fought, so it pretty much came out of nowhere.

The conversation did not go well at all.  He says he doesn't want another child and can't afford one. It seems like he has no interest in being a father to this child. He already pays 800 a month for his other 2 children, so that sucks up most of his paycheck. I get it. It's a lot to handle. 

I personally thought I'd never be able to conceive over childhood sexual trauma. Yet here I am. I don't know if I want this child to grow up with a father who doesn't want him, no matter what I decide. 

I'm scared and lonely. I don't know what to do. We broke up because we need time separately to get our lives in check and ""be better, but adding a child to that just complicates things. I don't know what to do. My family said they'd disown me if I had an abortion.

The breakup had probably been coming for a while (although I was definitely in denial) because despite the fact that we love each other, things were just not working. 

Anyways, I initially felt relieved but now I am very scared. Part of it is that  I'm excited to be single for the first time in four years, but being an older person, I'm really deeply uncertain of what comes next.  I don't even want to think about dating at all.   

Anyways, I could use some reassurance that all of the uncertainty gets better from here on out.",9
Cleaning a menstrual cup at work,5,dnccbi,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dnccbi/cleaning_a_menstrual_cup_at_work/,9,1572115775.0,"I recently spoke to the maintanence woman at work about getting a lock installed on the external door of our toilet so that I could rinse out my cup if I needed to. It only has a single stall in it anyway and most people wait outside anyway so it wouldn'tbe a huge inconvevience to others. There is also a disabled toilet with a sink in it I could use, but I'm not really comfortable using that when there are people who need it whereas it is just convenient for me.

It got approved, but I was told I would need to provide me own cleaning product to sanitise the sink afterwards. This seems really odd to me. Has anyone heard of/experienced something similar?",5

I'm gaining more confidence in saying no when I want to. Or at least I KNOW, on a rational level, that I have the right to.

With autonomy and abuse issues, it's so easy to tell when things went too far. I don't mean it as a negative thing but a useful lesson for me. Reading your stories has helped a lot to recognize the signs of an easy victim in myself. I'm certain they will help me to avoid abuse. If it would happen to me, however, your stories of healing and supportive comments have erased a lot of fear and shame linked to it.

Thank you for sharing your success stories, career paths, your working life. While I thought I did, I haven't had many real life role models of successful women who focus on their own happines as much as the well being of others. (Not meaning money or career but freedom and independence as well as pursuing an inspiring career. I honestly hadn't realised how binding it is to not be able to support yourself without your partner.)

It can be sad and frightening knowing how much more dangerous a woman's life can be but it's the support here and your stories of healing that keep me empowered and wanting to learn more.

Now, I might have an opportunity to lose my virginity. There’s this guy I’ve been talking to and we have some mutual friends.

I’ve only been on dates with guys and kissed one. I still haven’t had a serious boyfriend yet. 

Anyways this guy has been sweet talking me into having sex, potentially becoming “friends with benefits.” Not gonna lie, I’m feeling super tempted. I’m still terrified though. I really don’t want to get pregnant or a STD. But the other half of me really wants to just experience having sex. Then again the voice in my head says, “Wait till you have your first boyfriend!” 

Ugh, I just don’t know what to think. I mean is losing your virginity really that important? Is there anything you wish you knew before having sex for the first time? Please let me know any advice or insight you have on it. Or on my particular situation. I’d appreciate it a lot.

However, today I got a phone call saying that I tested positive for HPV, and they want me to get a colposcopy. After further questioning and researching, I discovered that this test is done to further diagnose the abnormal cells that appeared on my Pap test; if they see anything of note they’ll send the cells to a lab for a biopsy. 

Is this standard procedure, or is this only done for patients who are suspected to have cancer?

It’s important to note here that I had completed two rounds of the Gardasil shot when my annual Pap test was done. This week, I finally got my third round of the Gardasil shot.

We've had many slight ""minidramas"" in the relationship, but never any real big fights.

Now he has bought his first apartment and we've agreed to live separately for a while and ""focus on ourselves"". It was I who suggested that after a long time of feeling like something was missing in the relationship and because of us not being able to communicate good enough to solve that.

I don't want the relationship to end because I still love him. I want us to be able to figure things out. 

Since he agreed to us living separate I assume he too feels something isn't quite right between us, but he doesn't seem to want to discuss it any further. 

The thing is that now it seems he just wants to continue on like nothing has happened, even though he's soon moving out without me. He says we have already talked enough about or relationship and gets really annoyed if I mention it. I can't help but have mixed feelings and emotions when he wants to hug and caress me when I know soon we won't even live together anymore and he seems fine with it. 

Like I said we have talked about this before, but I don't feel like we have come to any good conclusion. I'm not sure I can just pretend everything is fine, even if I want too. 

The issues we have aren't huge, it's just many little things that I guess we just don't have the skills to sort out and find solutions too. 

I feel at a loss on how to prosess this and would really appreciate some of your thoughts.


Update:

We talked a little again. More calmly this time and I feel a bit more at ease. 

Basically he just says he definitely still wants to be with me, and doesn't think the fact that we live separately means the relationship is over. He wants it to work he says. He says he isn't fussed because he is trying to take everything one day at a time. 

He isn't as much of a ""feeler"" as I am, so I am trying to accept that even though I am having more of an emotional reaction than him it doesn't mean he doesn't care. 

Short story of why we agreed on living separately is because I'm on disability aid because of an anxiety disorder and he worries about me ""wasting away"" if I don't get an education or work or something ""meaningful"" to fill my time with. It stresses him out. He is a person who loves his work and gets fulfillment from it. 

Me on my side feel like I'm living an ok life all things concidered, and I've been taking small steps to be more social, work out more, get in touch with a therapist again etc. I don't have any huge aspirations in my life, and so I'm just trying to stay content. It stresses me out that I stress him out, since I feel like a burden, and that's the main reason why I suggested living separate so we both could relax from that.",2

the vast majority of my friends are male, and this is how its been pretty much my entire life. this is mostly because i have more ""masculine"" interests, im into video games, IT, all that kinda stuff. i dont necessarily see this as a problem, i love my male friends, but i wish i had some female friends too. guys dont wanna talk girl talk. 

my boyfriend is very good to me and listens when i want to talk about ""girl stuff,"" but we both know deep down he doesnt really care about shane dawsons makeup pallete and stuff like that. and as much as he tries to empathize with my period pains and issues, at the end of the day hes never experienced it himself. i dont blame him for any of that, hes an incredible boyfriend, i just wish i had a girl to talk about that stuff with. 

id say i only have 2 female friends, neither of which im super close with. one of them ive never even met in person, we met on minecraft (lol)

ive had girl friends come and go, but i can never seem to hold a friendship with one for more than a few years. it always ends in a fight or some other stupid drama. but some of my guy friends ive been friends with for ages. one of my best friends i met in first grade, and honestly i think weve had like one argument in the 12 years weve known each other. 

my heart aches with jealousy every time i see a group of girls hanging out and having fun together. i wish i could have that experience at least once in my life. its my fault a bit too. i dont go out of my way to maintain the friendships i do have, and i dont actively try to make new friends when given the opportunity. i was going to college for a brief time, but withdrew due to personal reasons, and in the midst of hating myself for dropping out i cut off all the people i met there. now talking to them is just awkward and it feels forced.

I got lucky that the doctor is a “one and done” parent, too. He gave me his speech on alternate methods of birth control and repeatedly told me it was permanent. I repeatedly told him I didn’t want the option to have more children, but if I ever changed my mind, I could still carry a child. He agreed to do it.

It took calling the main office line and being transferred to leave yet another message for her, as well as another message with the receptionist. I have time off planned for November and December, so my option was October, within the month of setting up the surgery date. 

The day crept up on me but I was super excited. Every staff member I saw yesterday knew how excited I was for this surgery as I shared with them how I felt about my elective surgery. Every nurse asked me what I was having done, as I’m sure it is their procedure to ensure they’ve got the right patient, but I said it with a huge smile every time. The doctor came for a visit to go over the procedure as I lay in the hospital bed in my purple gown prepped for the surgery. Again he said in a questioning manner, “It’s permanent.” I said I knew. Again he asked if I wanted the procedure. I said, “Absolutely!” He shook my hand, my mom’s and sister’s hands as he agreed to continue with our plans.

I've been one myself, but it's come up again for me in recent days and I'm looking for both insight as well as to get it off my chest. 

A friend of mine was badly beaten up by her boyfriend a couple of days ago. He's an alcoholic, has had a history of erratic and angry behavior, etc. Her toddler witnessed the assault. She kicked him out and had no contact until he text her today. Along with apologizing and expressing his shame he also expressed that he ""just wanted her to do this one thing"" and ""all she does is nag."" Which, in my opinion, is his way of saying ""it's your fault that I beat you up."" 

It makes me angry to the point of tears. I wish I could help her. I wish I could go back in time and show up and intervene. I wish I could just make her understand that his statements are him making excuses and passing the blame and that NOTHING excuses him putting his hands on her. I held her today while she cried. I've listened to her talk about how she tried so hard to fight him off. I can see her shame and disappointment in knowing her small child saw it and tried to defend her.

I broke up with my ex because he was no good for me. There was no way we could work with the issues he had. Despite of his problems, I deep down still had feels for him and I wanted to stay on good terms. I realize it backfired on me because I’m too nice of a person. I let him continue to contact me, did favors when he asked, and when we saw each other, one thing led to another and we ended up having sex, *three* times within the past two weeks.

I was on BC pills while we dated for five months. I quit them mid-pack after the breakup, convincing myself that I was done with him. A couple weeks later, when we ended up having sex, there was no type of protection whatsoever other than pulling out (which was done even while I was on the pill). On the three occasions we had sex, I took EC the following day. I felt immediate regret each encounter, and it hit the worst after the third time. I never hated myself so much in my life not only for letting him continue to screw me, but I’m now facing the anxiety of possibility ending up pregnant. Waiting at least two weeks to test seem like eternity for me, and I have no clue what to expect since my hormones will be thrown off.

I’m now experiencing symptoms of PMS, like I used to have before I started BC. I never experienced nausea/vomiting, or morning sickness, but I know I can’t rely on that because it can mimic pregnancy, which really scares me.

It was a hot Summer day and I wore a small tank top. I don’t know how I got there but we were in the classroom during a lesson and me, the teacher and the other favorite student was sitting on a bench of sorts. He was in the middle and he had his arms around both of us. After some time I felt his arm struggle to get somewhere and I immediately got uncomfortable. Until I felt a poke on the side of my breast. Luckily it stopped there and I didn’t think much of it. It was only a year after that I realized how wrong it was and I cried for an entire night. My parents asked about it but I told them it was nothing.

He's got mental problems I can't handle, and refuse to fall prey to ever again.

Last night I realized I can't ever speak to him with that kind of wife love ever again.

I want him healthy and safe, and will always love him. But, I have to from a distance in order to heal.

He was my first. I let the man I loved, who I allowed to take my first willing sexual experience, to tear me down to shreds.

The first time we had sex was super uncomfortable. It wasn't that I didn't want to, but I didn't know what I was doing. I don't even remember feeling lubricated. I had my period a few days later.

As we got more emotionally connected during sex, my panic attacks and PTSD snuck into the equation. He held me during my panic attacks, and loved me. That's what I needed when it was there. The sex was great. It was never a tool for him to own me, nor was it forced. I thank God for that every day. We had three ""we might be pregnants"" and never got pregnant. I thank God for that every day. I am not pregnant now and there is no chance. We struggled with whether to use NFP or condoms, and finally, for my sanity, used condoms.

I believe that this was the death punch to our relationship. He believed, and I still agree, that God would not fault us for being responsible in planning for our future, and to give our kids stability. Mind you there is no future for him and I.

The abuse, as far as I can recall, started after our wedding.

My soon-to-be-ex and I always had squabbles, which sucked. I got arrested once \[before we married\] for attacking his hands with a crescent wrench while he worked on our car and blatantly ignored my requests to stop working on it. He was not abusive in that situation, and I do not believe standing by him at THAT time was a wrong thing to do. I have nothing on my record, and am going before two judges in order to see this separate shit through.

We married in summer 2018, and it was the hottest day I can remember experiencing in my home state. I was nervous the entire day, thanks body for not wanting to eat, and being ready to scream at everyone at the reception because I was super hangry. I remember truly feeling his love that day. His kiss at the altar was real, his smiles were genuine, and he said sweet things that I will remember for a long time.

Our honeymoon was wonderful too. I don't remember a good portion of it because I was high on endorphins.

We camped, spent time at a little motel we loved in the northern part of our state, and went to a zoo.

We got a stuffed tiger and a stuffed koala, as well as a plastic fish and turtle, that I kept. My kids will love those little things later on.

Right around the time of our wedding, we went to a family party, where my bruises were on-display. I wore jean shorts because jeans were too painful. I had yellow and blue bruising on at least one calf, and told my family that stbeh and I were sparring in the house. They bought it.

The worst not me abuse was about six weeks before we split. He threw dishes, food, and things in our kitchen, and destroyed dishes that were extremely sentimental to me. We cleaned it together, and I tried to move on.

The hardest part was knowing I was not responsible, and yet, I felt it. He was my husband, so I was supposed to love him through his worst, y'know?

He told me around this time that ""He'd thought about killing me"" around that episode. I should've left. It was the worst feeling in the world. The man that I thought was not perfect, but who God made for me, thought about taking my life.

The last night he and I shared a bed was the worst. He kept screaming that we were just friends and even thinking about this raises my core body temp.

(time to break for meds and food)

Now... back to the last night.

He and I fought, over what I don't remember, with words, and then it became physical.

He got on top of me, and screamed. I tried to get him off of me, and he turned me back over with his body force, and bit me.

The fucker bit my nose! Right where he'd broken it with his wedding ring earlier this year.

And, all it left was a small bruise. I ripped it open with my fingers, and made sure to tell the cop that.

I tried to defend myself that night, by pulling his long, beautiful brown hair. He hated that. I will miss the smell of his hair.

That set fucker off hard.

I will never not be grateful for pulling his hair.

The next night I stayed somewhere else.

Two nights later, I was somewhere else.

After a few days, I went to a shelter.

I am there now.

I feel loads safer.

The judge had the victim pick the sentence and she asked for probation because at the time she felt she would be responsible for ruining his life. I have also found out that there have been at least two or three other victims since then who ended up not testifying. I found social media posts they made about what happened and it is heartbreaking and credible, as well as a post from his old bandmates in his last band where they corroborated this and found out that he had lied to them about it.

My husband has met this guy and is shocked and horrified because he seemed like a really nice kid. I thought he was a really nice kid. His current girlfriend who I met at the shoot is just 18 and seemed very vulnerable. The shoot was at his house. I applied makeup to his fucking face. I lost my virginity through rape. One of the other band members is a high school teacher and apparently the band knows about what he has done.

I feel sick. I found out that I know one of his victims and he ruined her life. I don't know if I should confront the band. I don't know which of our many mutual friends knows and just doesn't care. I don't know what to do. Help.",21

Prophylactic/Preventative Mastectomy?,1,dn32b9,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dn32b9/prophylacticpreventative_mastectomy/,6,1572063091.0,"I recently had some genetic testing done by my gynecologist and found out that I have a prettttty high genetic risk for breast cancer.

Some of the risk management options I was given were:

* Imaging every 6 months (mammogram once a year and MRI once a year; mammograms involve radiation, which over time is a lot, and the contrast agent for MRIs builds up in small amounts in your bone and brain, and they don't seem to really know what that means yet)
* 5 year low-dose preventative chemo regimen (cutting my risk in half)
* oophorectomy (getting my ovaries taken out, which reduces my risk of breast and ovarian cancer to almost zero, but also means I would start menopause immediately and would increase my risk of heart disease and osteoperosis; also I'd be sterile but I've wanted to be sterilized since I was 22 so that's a non-issue for me)
* Prophylactic/Preventative Mastectomy and reconstruction, both of which would be covered by insurance.

I know I have time to decide, and being high risk doesn't mean I'll wake up with cancer tomorrow or even next month, but...

Honestly, the mastectomy makes the most sense to me in terms of other risks, future quality of life, etc.  But it also seems like the most dramatic one?

My gyno said she's had patients with a much lower risk than mine have the prophylactic mastectomy.

I guess I'm looking for feedback from people who have chosen (or not chosen) prophylactic mastectomies done.

I'm 28 and have a lot of time but also would rather address this sooner than later.  I know I don't want an oophorectomy or the preventative chemo, just because I have enough invisible illness in my life that I don't need more symptom management on top of it.

"""Women's Work"" at the shop",3,dn16ov,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dn16ov/womens_work_at_the_shop/,9,1572055225.0,"I don't know where to put this up but I've been bottling this for a while and I feel like this rant is relevant here, to some extent.

Forgive my whining tone but when did I say in my interview for my internship that I am savvy with filing? When, in the last three years of being a paid employee, did I brag about my filing capabilities? Not once did I mention anything about doing secretarial work, or as it's come to be dubbed, ""women's work"".

I am a woman, I am working as a graphic designer and prepress technician. I'm about to land full-time hours, but in these last three years at this humble mom-and-pop printshop, I have realized a few things that put me on edge. One issue stands out above all others: Filing away job folders. This is a job often performed by the senior woman, who does some graphic design, but nothing much beyond writing copy. When she's not here (small shop, have to share hours) I have to perform these tasks. The remainder of our staff are men, with the exception of the boss's wife, who takes over CR operations, estimates, production management, everything under the damn sun. She'd take over my job if she were more tech-savvy, of this I'm sure.

My beef: Why is it always a woman doing the filing?

Someone's going to accuse me of being a brat, but at this point I don't give a damn. I attended college and acquired a massive amount of debt, and all of it was so I could do something I enjoyed and excelled at. So I could eventually abandon the fast-food drive-thru. So I could live on my own and be comfortable. Close to achieving the ""comfortable"" part so I don't want to jeopardize that over something like this, but it really irks me.

I sort the paper on the shelves. I do inventory. I fix the files customers send over and convert them to PDFs (even though you can do that yourself when you click ""SAVE AS..."" but I guess I'd be out of a job if people started doing that themselves) and I oversee not just the design work but the printing and the bindery/cutting/scoring. I also pride myself as IT problem solver.

I did not attend classes for filing. I did not get into student loan debt for filing. I did not seek a position here to file. Anyone with a brain and fingers can perform this job and, while it's not beneath me and there's nothing wrong with this line of work, it's not what I'm here for. It's not my job description. We both know, if I had a big beautiful ween, I wouldn't be cutting labels and slapping them on these damn folders. If anyone can do it, why is it always a woman and never Jim? His foot's bad and he wouldn't mind sitting for a while. Gary could use a break from sorting mail pieces. Chris just browses reddit when he's got nothing to do.

Okay, rant over. Back to filing. As a side note: Shout-out to you fellas who always get asked to lift heavy things.",3
Looking for advice. Should I have children?,2,dmy0ry,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dmy0ry/looking_for_advice_should_i_have_children/,10,1572041572.0,"I suffer from GAD, panic disorder, and some depression. I've never been suicidal but I've thought at times maybe it's better if I weren't alive.

I got off my meds almost a year ago now and I was doing okay until I moved into my first detached home in a new city about a month ago now. My dog ate rat poison that the previous owners left and I had a few panic attacks and have been having them on and off since. Dog is fine btw.

Got off my BC recently as my husband and I talked about having children now that we have our own home and stable jobs. My period sucks it's incredibly heavy and doesn't even space out properly I get it like every 3 weeks instead of 4. So that's causing added stress.

Anyway we have both been not 100% sure about wanting kids but I thought about it and I do. But after this bout of panic attacks I've been second guessing. I looked it up and found out that if you have GAD while pregnant it comes with a load of health risks. Link: https://www.verywellmind.com/generalized-anxiety-disorder-during-pregnancy-4149961

I had always expected that I would have a hard time being pregnant but just figured I'd get through it. Once I read this stuff though I started bawling. (Got my period today so that doesn't help)

I can just imagine being anxious and then being doubly so thinking what my anxiety is doing to my baby.

It also says that the child can be born with mental health issues as well. Do I want to bring a child into this world who could possibly have my problems?

Do I want to risk my health and the health of my child? Do I want to risk a miscarriage?

I don't know anymore, though there is still a part of me that wants to have a child despite all of this. I think both me and my husband would make great parents and I would love to share my life and knowledge with someone and give all my love to them.

I've considered adopting as well. But that would be a while off as I know it's incredibly expensive.

Ladies your thoughts would be most appreciated. Anyone who has struggled with mental health especially. And women who have chosen to have children despite having mental health issues.

I'm 32 and my husband is 28 btw. Maybe we should wait a year or so to see it my mental health improves?

I know there is no clear cut answer but your insights would be most appreciated.

I work 7 days a week and always go home after work, preferring to spend my free time reading or watching TV. However, my friend was organizing a huge party and told me she required my attendance. 

I don’t remember drinking so much, but every time I turned around someone was handing me something because they were so excited to see me out. It’s my own fault for accepting the drinks, but I was having fun and it was nice to see all my friends in one place. 

The party moves to a house. I don’t remember getting there. A guy had been flirting with me throughout the night and we end up hooking up. I never hook up with people. Only once before in my entire life have I  had sex outside of a committed monogamous relationship where both parties had full panel STD tests before engaging in sexual activity. 

Guy does not use a condom. I should have demanded, but I was literally black out. I don’t remember getting to the party and I don’t remember leaving. I barely remember hooking up with him. 

Now I have herpes. Gonorrhea too, but at least it’s treatable. 

I feel so ashamed in myself. So upset. I feel like my entire life has been ruined. I can’t imagine anyone will ever want to be with me again. People keep telling me there are special sites for dating others with herpes and that sounds so damn sad to me. Relegated for the rest of my life to only being involved with other infected people? Fuck, man. 

I also don’t have insurance and don’t know how I will get access to the daily antiretrovirals required to help lower transmission rates. I’ve had to miss work because the sores are so painful and don’t even know if I’ll be able to pay my bills this month. 

I never, ever, ever do anything like this. And the one time...and it will follow me around for the rest of my life. 

It breaks my heart that this changes everything. I will likely not even be able to give birth vaginally now because of this. 

I’m just so, so, so sad. Needed somewhere to vent.

Edit: I want to make sure people reading this know that the man involved was also drunk.",9130

How to talk to inappropriate roommate?,9,dmqccq,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dmqccq/how_to_talk_to_inappropriate_roommate/,20,1571996085.0,"Hi, not sure if this is the right sub for this but I’m going to give it go.

I (26F) have a roommate (28 M) that I’ve lived with (in total) for ~3 years now. 

We have always been friends. He’s never been inappropriate with me prior to now. He’s seen me in my ups and downs over the years and has been, in his own way, very supportive. And by “his own way” I mean, stoic but supportive. 

A year ago, he moved out and started living with a girl he had started seeing. Our contact fell off for that time as our friendship, though nice, was more of convenience than of effort. 

His relationship ended recently and a room in the house became available so he moved back in a couple of months ago now. So, for the most part, we’ve fallen back into our friendship of convenience around the house. Except, this time, its been a bit different...

Once, recently, I was wrapped in a towel and walking to the bathroom (as I’ve done thousands of times before). He stopped me and tried to convince me to come have a drink with him in the kitchen. He put his hands on my hips. I was shocked and just brushed past him.

Today, he came to talk to me in my room. A friendly conversation about laundry. And then he made a comment about my yoga pants. He actually put his hand in the waist band and made a joke about how they were “really nice because you could see everything. Including your great ass.”

I don’t know what was wrong with me but I felt choked up, like I completely couldn’t say anything, so I just laughed and pushed him off. Then I told him that he was being gross and that we are just friends. He acknowledged that and then did it again. 

I told him to leave. He then said to me that he would go as long as I would turn around and show him my ass in the yoga pants. I lost it. I was laughing uncomfortably and asking him, awkwardly, to go. He did, after a minute, but I was so shocked. I’m afraid that my tone did not seem at all serious, I was laughing and smiling but tense and trying to get him off me. I felt as if it could be a bad thing to be too upfront with him and angrily tell him to fuck off as we live together. 

The first time it happened, I brushed it off which wasn’t a great thing to do but it’s what happened. Now, it’s happened twice and even as a “joke” he was aggressive in touching me and I did not like it.


I feel stupid now and I don’t know what to do. With strangers and people I don’t know well, I have no issues with asserting myself. Even with those I do know pretty well. But I’m this situation? I’m at a real loss. I like my house. I’ve been here for years and have no plans to move any time soon.

And I had been sexually active since I started dating my ex (we broke up around June). Anyway, I had had sex with my ex boyfriend 6-7 times that was consensual and one final time that it wasn't. And while it took me some time to fully understand what had happened, I've made my peace with it. 

After breaking up with him, I had only started seeing a guy this past month. He is someone that I've known for a while and considered to be a ""good friend"". And he knew about what had happened with my ex boyfriend and was respectful about where he touched me whenever we made out. Anyway, the past Friday we decided to meet up seeing as we'd just taken our last mid terms and I remember telling him that I don't want to have sex - 3rd base was good enough but I didn't want to have sex. I honestly don't know how it happened but I remember feeling a sharp pain, followed by frantically telling him to pull out. He insisted that it was ""just for a little while"" ""it felt good"" and the next thing I knew, he had ejaculated inside me. It lasted a minute or maybe even 5, I don't have much recollection. I was horrified yes, and after he pulled out, he asked me in a shocked voice, ""Is that blood?"" 

I rushed to the bathroom and cleaned myself up the best I could while still being in shock as to what had happened. The remaining evening was just a blur and I remember taking an ECP within 8 hours. Over the weekend though, a rumor that I'm easy and will sleep with just about anyone spread reached me. “The ____'s slut“ (replace the blank w uni name) is what they we're calling me. Turns out, he was one of the people propogating it, so I spent half of the week dealing with that. Now that things have settled down, I'm trying to process things. 

Number one, why did I start bleeding? Afaik, my hymen broke when I was 7 (cycling). And it never happened w my ex. 

Number two, the whole fear of the chances of me being pregnant. Even my ex didn't ejaculate inside me when the incident occured w him (took an ECP then too). And because it hasn't even been a whole week, I'm sure I won't even test positive. Also, while I was PMSing when the incident occurred, I haven't had any of my regular PMS symptoms since Tuesday.

Long story short one of my co workers was telling me his 21 year old is due to have a baby next month. We kind of started talking/debating on if that's too young to have a kid. I sided with now a days that's pretty normal where as he thought you need to be at least 25 before you should start thinking about marriage and a child. I made a statement along the lines of ""well I'm 26 and I still don't know if i even want kids"" and he responded with a slight chuckle and ""you should know either way if you want kids or not by now"".

I don't know, it rubbed me the wrong way because I still feel really young. Like, I still have dreams and goals I want to fulful (finish college and get my degree, travel the world, see new things/broaden my horizons etc). I know i could still do all those things with a kid, but i always felt I needed to be in a certain place in my life where I would feel I'm ready and I dont think I am there. If and when I do get to that place where i feel i accomplished my goals and Im ready to ""settle down"", maybe I still won't want kids. But, I dont feel like I have to have it all figured out. I have been with my boyfriend for 4 and a half years and I can see myself marrying him and experiencing life's crazy adventures together, but we both agreed kids are not happening any time soon.

I don't know, am I wrong for thinking I dont have to know exactly what I want yet? Part of me agrees with my co worker because that's an important and impactful life event, but a part of me also thinks I am basically still barely an adult that doesn't know what will make me the most happy yet.

Never let a man convince you that abuse in any form is normal.,1223,dm2gkz,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dm2gkz/never_let_a_man_convince_you_that_abuse_in_any/,128,1571879958.0,"(**Please also read the edit at the bottom of this post**)

The subject of domestic violence is weighing heavily on my heart today, and I feel a strong need to reiterate these thoughts on the chance someone needs to see it: 

If your boyfriend or husband hits you, pushes you around, demands sex from you when you don’t want it, guilts you into giving false consent for things, isolates you from your friends or family, hurts you and then makes you feel sorry for him, insults you, that is not normal behavior. Anything even remotely like this is abnormal. 

I grew up in an abusive household. When we finally left and moved into our safe house, my mother explained to me what a slow escalation it was from the initial red flag warnings to the life-threatening situations they became 20 years later. Take the warnings seriously because they will not get better.

Please. If you’re experiencing any of these red flags, *get out*. It breaks my heart to see women settle for these types of men, and think that it’s the way relationships are across the board. You might not think you deserve better, but you absolutely do. We’re all deserving of love and respect, and no man holds the right to abuse us, especially in the name of “love.” 

I know that leaving is not always a simple solution, and that you put yourself at a potential high risk in doing so. But please find out what your resources are: 

United States:
*National Domestic Violence Hotline* 1-800-799-7233

Around 2 years ago, I was 13 and sexually active. I’m 15 now and attend online school and am rather happy being alone. I just want to tell my parents about something that happened 2 years ago but I don’t know how to tell them. I had a boyfriend when I was 13 and he would always want to receive oral or make out ALL THE FUCKING TIME. After weeks of him pushing me to perform oral on him, I did so. I remember it making me REALLY uncomfortable and stopped almost 2 minutes in. He complained a bit but eventually let me go home. I’m guessing a week after the first oral encounter, he pushed me to do it AGAIN. I didn’t want him to get annoyed with me or think I was a loser so...I did it, again. This time he kind of forced my head down and told me to a better job. 

Just thinking about it now makes me want to cry, I was so miserable and didn’t even know it. My parents knew I had a boyfriend and even asked me if I was sexually active, I lied and said no. Every time I would hang out with him at his place, he would instantly get hard and push it up against me. I felt disgusted by this and would try make excuses to go back home or to do something else and he would always say please or beg me to stay. 

A year passes by and I turn 14. So at this point, me and my boyfriend have been together for 1 whole year and on my birthday, he was pushing to have sex. I REALLY did NOT want to do this. I gave him a firm no and he told me that everyone else was doing it and we were the only ones who weren’t. I explained to him that I didn’t want to lose my virginity so young and I really didn’t want to do it with him. Of course, he still didn’t care and pushed for...anal. I was dumbfounded at how persistent he was to fulfill his sexual desires and not even care about how I felt.

 I was later diagnosed with depression and skipped school A LOT. I didn’t want to socialize with anyone and ended up losing almost all my friends, I didn’t care about anything at that point and ended up breaking up with my boyfriend. He was MAD. Called me a whore and told everyone at school that I WAS THE ONE who wanted to perform sexual acts. Everyone made fun of me and my name was in everyone’s mouth. Now I’m enrolled in online school. 

I started getting sharp pain down there and lower abdominal pain. I also get abdominal pain when I go use the bathroom. It’s been happening for almost a full year now and I’m TERRIFIED of it being an STI. I’m a mess and I want to go to the doctor to get this checked out but my parents have NO IDEA about me being sexually active when I was 13. I know I should tell someone about this but I’m just so scared and ashamed. I feel like I’M the one who is going to get in trouble... I’m crying as I write these last bits of my post.

I was sexually assaulted by an older boyfriend when I was 15. I never let him have what he wanted (physical sexual interaction) so he took it from me, simple as that. About every year since it happened I've had like, A PTSD Resurgence. I'll start having night terrors and flashbacks about it, and it'll turn into something I can't get out of my head until I learn to cope again.

Every time this happens I revisit one specific thing - a poem that I wrote to vent about it when I was 16, almost exactly a year after the assault happened. Even considering the fact that it kinda sucks and is very rambly, for me it's a piece that holds a lot of power. And every time I revisit it it reminds me of how many times art has saved me. For a long time I wrote, but recently I've been delving into music and jewelry-making to help myself feel and move on again.

Anyway, just a PSA. Creation has power, even if you're just delving into the creations of others. If you're struggling to heal, I would always recommend pouring yourself into art to help move on. It's saved my life more times than I can count.",4

And I tried to tell her she doesn't need to have anything to do with him, but she insists that he has""changed"" and she has forgiven him. I got upset and haven't messaged her anymore since then. She is also pregnant, and lives with her mom who is also toxic and abusive. Drinks all the time, and always screams at her. She has other places she can stay, but refuses. I am deeply worried for her child's safety once they're born. 

How do remove her from my life without feeling guilty about it?",15
Some thoughts on the relationship between sexual attractiveness and worth,9,dmkv7o,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dmkv7o/some_thoughts_on_the_relationship_between_sexual/,7,1571971908.0,"Sometime last summer, I was hanging out with 5 friends. One of them was my best friend. There were also two guys and a couple (M/F). I was dating one guy, the other guy had expressed interest to previously, and the couple had recently invited me to have a threesome with them. (And my best friend and I are totally platonic.)

I remember realizing then that 4 out of 5 friends (including all of the men present) wanted to have sex with me. I felt flattered and confident. Not like I had power \*over\* them or anything, but just then I felt empowered, welcome, and supported. It felt good to be in my body. Later, I reflected upon it more, and thought, Why did I feel empowered and confident knowing they wanted to have sex with me? Why would it have felt different if we were all platonic friends? Given the same situation, but 100% platonic feelings, I think I would have felt less empowered. It dawned on me how much women are taught that their worth is in being sexually attractive and/or sexually available. What if we could feel so attractive, loved, supported, beautiful, welcome, and confident in our platonic friendships as we do when we know people are sexually attracted to us?

PS. It's almost hard for me to express to women that I was flattered by this situation, because it feels like I'm tooting my own horn. I'm still learning that it's okay to have open joy in feeling attractive and expressing sexuality.",9

I'm having a rough day. I have crippling ADHD most the time. I can barely function some days, and am often facing the consequences. I do take meds, and they help, but not entirely. I should look into making new appointments, but I can't even manage that.

Sooooo.... I am the  worst at remembering to pay things on time, especially parking tickets.  I have so many parking tickets that I can't afford to pay, and a couple  of weeks ago I had a notice on my windshield that I had so many that my  car could be towed if I didn't get the value down.

Since seeing that notice I kept meaning to call the city to see if I  could work out a payment plan or something, but kept forgetting of  course. Well today when I was supposed to leave for work I come out and  my car isn't there. At first I'm thinking that I must have forgotten  where I parked it, but my street always has ample street parking. But  still, I could have done something weird and parked it some place weird,  or forgot I drove to work and took the bus home, so maybe it's at work.  I delved deep into my fragmented memory bank, and I know I drove it  home last night.

I now have $500  in parking tickets and tow fees, and am so so so so so so so so so so so  so fucking poor. My car probably isn't worth the cost to get out, but  also I need my car and can't afford a new car. I also can't get approved  for a personal loan because my debt to income ratio is so high. My  student loan payments are brutal each month, and I'm already paying the lowest that I can.

I just want to cry, and I hate myself for being so incapable of taking care of myself. I also am too embarrassed to tell anyone, except for my boyfriend and one of my best friends, but they aren't in a position to help me. I could talk to my parents but I've been such a burden my whole adult life with shit like this, and I feel ashamed. I'm 31 and still struggling.",0
My girlfriend is a victim of rape and incest and I don't know how to help.,9,dmhz16,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dmhz16/my_girlfriend_is_a_victim_of_rape_and_incest_and/,4,1571959520.0,"I'm at my wits end emotionally and mentally, I just don't know how to help her anymore. She was first raped at the age of nine by a family friend, and then from the age of ten to fifteen by her grandfather. I have never met someone with such a tragic story: abusive foster homes, homelessness, completely abandoned by everyone. I'm sorry if this post is scrambled, I have a hard time organizing my thoughts on this matter. Her father went to prison for sexual assault/rape on teenage boys when she was thirteen, which forced her to stay with her rapist grandfather for an other two years until she found her voice and ended the cycle of abuse (her mother was MIA and also raped by the grandfather as a girl). 

When I met her she was living on the street, one night a man tried to rape her, she managed to fight him off, she called me and I immediately sent an uber to pick her up, she has been living with me ever since. 

This part is going to be a little technical (I'm a lawyer) but very relevant. In order to accelerate the trial process, the French judicial system often times doesn't forward the case to the highest criminal court (cour d'assises, mostly reserved for murder and rape) and instead refers to a ""lesser"" court. The problem is that in these hierarchically inferior courts, there is no jury, no media attention and more importantly less severe judicial decisions. She was pressured to accept this accelerated trial process and always refused. A month ago, eleven years after the rapes stopped, she finally got a court date in the supreme criminal court. Two days ago, her grandfather, who has a court ordered restraining order, tried to contact her.

Ever since (it's been a couple of months, but it has become much more violent), she has been taking her anger, every trauma and frustration out on me. I understand that it's not her fault, that I just happen to be the only other person in the room but I don't know how long I can last like this. She is followed by the leading expert psychiatrist on traumatologie and victimologie, and today she told me that her psychiatrist wanted to meet me, to explain to me why i'm the target of her trauma and anger. 

I just want to help her, but I don't know how long I can take this. She has no where else to go, and I'm sure as hell not sending her back on the street. Technically we broke up because our relationship became completely toxic, she would yell at me like i've never been yelled at before. I can take that more or less, I know it's not against me, but i'm just lost.

The reason i'm posting on this sub, I was wondering if other victims of rape and abuse had similar reactions, especially before trial (I'm a corporate lawyer, couldn't stomach criminal law) and if anyone had advice on how to handle this situation and how best to help her, other than being there for her and supporting her because it doesn't seem to be enough.

For a few months I was sort of dating/hooking up with this guy.  I was a virgin when i met him and hadnt been in a relationship of any kind so I dont really have anything to compare this to. 
The first few times we had sex it was really painful and not very pleasurable for me so it made me hesitant and anxious to have sex. Some days Id tell him i wasnt interested in having  sex because of how much itd hurt or that he would have to wait for me to be wet enough to have sex. He would pout and whine and complain that didnt want to have sex. We would start making out which would lead to him taking my clothes of and pressing himself against me. Id tell him again that i didnt want to have sex but he would ignore me and try to pull my underwear down. Id have to push his hand away or slap his hand to get him to stop but it would only work for a moment because seconds later hed be back to trying to take them off. I guess i would just give and next thing i know hes putting a condom on and rubbing his dick on my vagina. Again i would tell him it would hurt and i wasnt ready. He would tell me he wasnt going to do anything but put it in. Id go to push him away again but itd be too late and he was already in me thrusting away. I just laid there watching him and wincing from the pain.  I would try to tell myself that i wanted it and that since i wanted to have sex with him later on in the day then this was ok.  I would also bleed afterwards 
This happened multiple times. He would also persistently try to convince me to not use a condom and i gave in once but immediately regretted it. 
We did also have regular non painful sex and that was fine. I cant help but blame myself for what happened. Maybe if i had said no more firmly or tried to push him off me again. I still dont know if its considered rape since it wasnt violent or how rape is usually portrayed.",15

Graphic and bloody photos of any medical procedure blown up to poster size while people shout would intimidate and terrorize just about anyone. 
Imagine if someone had showed my grandpa a sawed off leg before he would be getting its new hip bone?  How about showing someone how they are hooked up to tubes, bloodied, and naked during a transplant? Doctors without bedside manner are often criticized because we expect a level of decorum shown to their patients. Protesting outside clinics, isn’t free speech, it’s bullying and its permitted because females are the target.



Now  imagine that you go to get a blood transfusion and instead the Jehovahs Witnesses set up a “center” next door that **looks** like the legitimate medical office you are seeking.  Upon arrival, they tell you why transfusions are wrong, dangerous and deadly and then provide you with “alternatives” based on their religious beliefs. Years ago the JW’s that lived in our area wanted pamphlets in the hospitals warning against blood transfusions. It was deemed irresponsible and unscientific and they said no, because to “provide spurious alternatives poses a significant health risk”. I would argue those clinics do the same.



This is the bullying of women seeking medical procedures under the auspices of “free speech”


Edit to add; since some misunderstood my assertion




#1 is protected free speech, it is also bullying. 
I was demonstrating the absurdity of it all by comparing it to other medical procedures where we would be aghast or demonstrably less tolerant of this sort of behavior. There is a double standard, I believe, in that **no other medical procedure** draws the ire and circus that abortion does.  We collectively as a culture accept a level of harassment without even questioning or discussing the relevance. 



As a former evangelical I am well aware of all the arguments they make and why, and it would apply to many medical procedures and many churches do preach against including: vasectomies, in-vitro fertilization, limb removal, tubal ligations, blood transfusions, birth control, organ transplant, vaccines, etc..**but** interestingly they only use their free speech right to protest on abortion and none of the others. And to me, **that** focus is a discussion that as a culture we should be having. Not challenging their right to free speech but rather challenging why many accept, without questioning, their fixation on this one issue, as they are repealing and changing laws to reflect their religious beliefs.",3440

I'm embarrassed about being a virgin, so much that even closest friends don't know about it, recently moved to Europe and everyone here is so open to sex and relationships, it's kinda an eye-opening, in a good way. I swear I don't come from a religious cult that forbids human contact, might seem like it but I just never found the right guy or im way too insecure about my body. 

So a few weeks ago I downloaded a dating app because my friends told me i needed some action "" little did they know, they're damn right"" but I cant also just lose it with whoever person comes my way and before i deleted the app, i matched with this guy and decided i was going to meet him.

It's been quite some dates now and I really like him, I decided I want to lose my v card with him but I'm scared that when the moment comes and I say I haven't done anything, he will just think I'm some kind of loser or that me losing it with him means i want something more than just having sex ( people are so scared of commitment) like I don't even know what I want all I know is that I like him and that I'm ready like its not that deep, I mean I'm 24 people that are younger than me are already doing trios or some pornhub shit like that.

He also never made a drastic move to insinuate that we should have sex but I know he's just being a nice guy and probably waiting for me to make the move but I also think that he might just get bored of me if I keep being so shy about it, I just feel I can't drag this for so long.

Should i feel this bad about being a virgin at my age? I'm just so sick of feeling this way, it feels embarrassing because of how the media and the world are nowadays. I feel like I haven't lived and I just want to know whats the right way to let him know.

It is pretty much as the title says. This morning I learned that my first love (let's call him Sam) is now in a relationship with a mutual acquaintance of ours by stumbling upon a picture on social media. It has been years since we dated and I'm in a completely different place now, I'm living together with my current boyfriend for Christ's sake, but my heart still sank when I saw the picture.

I've been struggling with self esteem issues all my life. Before I met Sam (around age 17), I felt like I wasn't worthy of love. I simply couldn't imagine anyone being genuinely interested in me. With Sam, I experienced that I was wrong; I fell hopelessly in love for the first time in my life and he loved me back. I think these were the happiest months of my life up until now. 

It didn't last long; after a month or two, he confessed that he had 'lost the feeling' and we stopped dating. I was devastated of course, but moved on and met my current boyfriend about half a year later. Me and Sam never really saw each other again. I know he moved out of town, but I have no idea how he is doing and that's okay.

When I saw the picture this morning however, everything suddenly came back and hit me so hard. The girl he's with has everything I feel I am lacking: she's attractive, sporty, social and has an interesting background. I feel the rejection again, the hurt, the feeling of being replaced by someone more interesting. It doesn't help that my current boyfriend and I are currently going through some relationship struggles. I started picturing what it could have been like with Sam, how perfect his relationship with this perfect girl would be, how I am not good enough for any of that. It really got me in a bad place again.

I do realise that I am horribly romanticizing my memories of Sam. The fact that I feel so bad about it now probably has more to do with my own insecurities and fears than with them actually being so flawless. So I'm trying to take a deep breath, shrug it off for now and be a little extra nice for myself today. Hopefully the soreness will go away with time. 

Thanks a lot if you managed to read all of this.

We've exchanged some deep personal info, and he seems like he is an open guy.  His text style is kind of terse and sarcastic, and he's not much of a buzz buzz double texter, but that doesn't bug me.  He's fairly responsive, initiates conversations, etc.

We were supposed to hang out on Monday for the first time; he text me saying he's about to sound pathetic, and explained some physical ailments and his need to go to the doctor.  I get it.  He immediately started to reschedule with me; the plan bounced around as classes and stuff kept getting cancelled.  We settled on dinner yesterday.

He text me yesterday morning letting me know work was rough, he was feeling kind of shitty, but he looked forward to chatting when he was in a better mood.  I didn't hear from him again until after class.  Then, he was triple and quadruple texting me, and he sent me paragraphs about how shitty work was, how annoyed he was feeling... basically not directly saying ""I don't want to come tonight"" but hinting at it.  I gave him an out after talking with my roommate.  I decided that a second flake is pretty shitty, but as someone with similar mental health issues to him, I totally get where he was coming from.  But he was still showing interest, so I decided to see how the next couple days went and then see if he was free over the weekend.  As soon as I gave him the out, he said he appreciated me and beat me to it by immediately rescheduling for Saturday.  Not a vague plan either; times and places have been set.  I'm going in with caution, not getting to excited.  But I rarely feel so comfortable talking to someone; and the first-date nerves and jitters didn't seem too bad each of the days I was supposed to see him.

My roommate/best friend gets why I'm willing to give him a third chance, even though she wouldn't have in my situation.  Another friend thinks I'm way too generous and that I shouldn't have even offered the second.  I do see where she's coming from, because usually, if they flake twice, nothing good will come out of it.

I hoping for the best, expecting the worst.  I definitely won't give a fourth chance if this doesn't pan out.

The first day of my period is really not fun and usually makes me stay at home, unless I really force myself. (maybe I'm just lazy then?)

Yesterday I took 7 painkillers in one day, and the pain was still there but the painkillers made it bearable. But do I really have to take that many pills to survive my period? Somehow it doesn't feel good to eat that many painkillers, several times a month.

I need some place to rant or for advice I don’t even know... recently I missed my period and did two tests.. I’m pregnant.. ok, that made me stressed as I am not in a situation to have kids, not to even mentioned I never wanted to be a mother. 


Fast forward to today, I meet up with my ex (a week after speaking what we gonna do etc) to go to the doctor to ask how to terminate. The doctor did the ultrasound and assured us that I’m 3-3.5 weeks pregnant. The problem is, that if me and my boyfriend remember correctly, the last time we had sex was 4 weeks ago. He accused me of lying and putting him through this because of god know what. 


I keep reading online, it says that there is a chance of ultrasound being off max 5 days regarding the day of conceiving. But my ex called the doctor and he assured it must be 3-3.5 weeks and it’s very rare to be wrong about these dates. I know for a fact I had no other chance to get pregnant with anyone else whatsoever. 


I don’t know what to do. I’m in a foreign country, not speaking language, it will be difficult to do the termination on my own but also I want him to understand I’m not lying.. for his own good as well as to prove that I care about him no matter what we had before...

It was killer. I was talking to my brother about it--a fix-it guy who I recently started talking to again--when he suggested he call one of his old friends in my town to come by and look at things. 

And who did he suggest? One of a set of brothers who were neighbors and peeping toms. They used to watch me through my windows which I did not understand were sheer enough to see through--we lived in the country and I never thought to go outside and check them. My parents had modest means but they went out and bought me metal Levolour blinds to keep my privacy intact. 

The main perp is dead;  died young of a heart attack. But his little brother is still around and apparently I'm a jerk for not wanting anything to do with him because he told my brother he didn't look. I can't see how he couldn't have--my room faced their house. 

Either way, now my mom wants me to drive down two hours and sit with them for brunch. That's with his wife I haven't spoken to in years because she always causes trouble. She's the kind of person who will complain bitterly about my brother to me (awkward) and then get angry with me if I mildly agree. Life is too short for that sort of bullshit, and I really don't want to have anything to do with her. 

I told my mom how my brother made me feel and to my husband I said that I am astonished that someone who had dealt with sexual abuse (my brother was assaulted by an uncle) when he was younger--dear God, why don't you get it? 

I wasn't going to post or whine about it but you know... my mom practically hung up on me when I said I really couldn't afford to come.

Also she ALWAYS talks to me with her husband on the phone. No privacy, ever. I did not want him to hear or have to explain to him what my issue was. But yeah, I had to.

My mom dated this guy while I was in high school. I was about 16 when they started. He is a POS. He was a leech with four kids, 3 about my age and one super young. My mom paid for so much for him and let him stay with us because he didn't have a place to go, only for him to turn around and buy random shit for his ex. She loved him and she thought he loved her.

Eventually, he proposed after breaking up with her like 2-3 times because he ""wasn't good enough"". Trust me, there came a point where I actually had his speech down and gave it back to him when he tried to explain to me in front of my mom why they were breaking up. His face was hilarious when I did this because I'm guessing he realized that I was aware of his bullshit. Anyways, what I remembered was that one time when I was a high school senior, he and his 4 girls were in my mom's and I's apartment. They were sitting at the dining table which is right next to the kitchen. We were eating, or at least I was trying to get food from the kitchen, and then he proceeds to ask me if he could adopt me and I could take his last name. This was after they had been married at the courthouse not too long ago, my mom told me after the fact and all I could think about was how this was the biggest mistake of her life (from her first marriage to my bio dad she at least got me, so it's something). I remember just standing there for a few seconds trying to figure out wtf was happening. I made eye contact with my mom and she looked encouraging.

Now, my sperm donor (as I call him because that's the most he's every really contributed to my continued existence) lost shared custody because of dugs and being irresponsible (not showing up when he was supposed to, paying child support, etc) and was only allowed supervised visits (I still remember the one and only time we had one). He and his family hadn't been a part of my life since I was like 3, so there were no real feelings of, ""But what about my dad?"". I realized that there was no real way I could say no without it being really obvious I didn't like him or 3 of his kids (him for his bullshit, one was a bully, the other a psycho, and the youngest was eh).

My response? ""Uuummmmm, no....sorry. I'm starting college soon and with my last name (it starts with Adr, his started with G) I get fairly early class add dates, so I don't want to lose out on that.""

Bruh, I'm awkward AF and I'm pretty sure that was my most awkward moment to date. I was put on the spot, in front of everyone, not just him and my mom. There was just no way to get out of it at that moment. I also knew they would end up divorcing since he never stepped up in anything or trying to actually become a family. Surprise surprise, they divorced not even a year later, which I am happy about.

Has anyone else had similar encounters?

PSA about the morning after pill,135,dlzoa6,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dlzoa6/psa_about_the_morning_after_pill/,31,1571867791.0,"I recently read an article about how you can still get pregnant from taking the morning after pill and the twitter thread is full of comments from people being like ""I did not know that!"" so I just wanted to post something here about how it works in case anyone's confused or worried.

Basically the morning after pill works by delaying ovulation, so if you haven't ovulated yet it will delay the egg from being released. If you've had unprotected sex and haven't already ovulated, this means the sperms won't have anything to fertilise and so will just swim about for a bit and then die off before you ovulate.

If you have ovulated, however, the pill won't work and you might get pregnant.

The problem is that it's hard to know when exactly you're ovulating because people's cycles are different and various factors could have an impact on it. If you have unprotected sex around day 12 of your cycle, you shouldn't be like ""okay that's it, I've already ovulated, I'm obviously going to get pregnant so there's no point in getting plan b"" because you might not have actually ovulated. Even if you use a period tracker app, they're not always totally exact - my period is normally a day later or earlier than it says, even tho I log it every month.

So there's my lil PSA, have a good day :)

Edit: know this is branded, but this is how it works as far as I understand it: [https://www.mymorningafter.co.uk/askella/2019/10/15/ask-ella-will-the-morning-after-pill-work-if-i-have-ovulated](https://www.mymorningafter.co.uk/askella/2019/10/15/ask-ella-will-the-morning-after-pill-work-if-i-have-ovulated)

For two years I taught English abroad in Spain, and I became close with a lot of my colleagues. One in particular become like a mother to me. She was so kind and comforting. I joined her family during vacation, and when I was sexually assaulted and didn't know where to turn, she immediately helped me and let me stay at her house for an entire week, no expectation of payment or anything, just so I wouldn't be alone. I loved her so much and we were great friends, although she was older (42, I am 28).

During the spring she started entertaining the idea of me being her au pair for part of the summer because i was going to be living in spain over the summer and then moving to a different city, but would have no job/income in summer. As a foreigner it would be tough so eventually I said okay. We went over payment, expectations, days off, etc. I began to get excited about the prospect. She had a big house in a small town outside of where I lived, a pool, her kids were so cute, and she talked of us going for walks together and working on school stuff. It seemed so great!

Naturally, transitioning from a colleague/friend relationship to a working one did not go well. Things she promised changed on a dime, and she was very flip-floppy when I tried to ask her about rules for the kids. She basically said they had none... but would get mad at me for letting them do something they apparently weren't allowed to do! She started criticizing me for eating a lot, telling me I should be healthy, and frequently refused me any time to hang with friends, even when she had told me before that it would be okay and then changed her mind. She never told me plans so I could never make any. I was a prisoner in this house. I started to rebel and became somewhat of a lazy au pair I'll admit, but I never abused any privileges or was mean to the kids or anything (I mean more like I just started letting the kids do whatever because she never gave me rules and just took the brunt of it). Eventually I left early and we parted ways amicably really, since I never discussed with her how I had been feeling about her treatment of me, and she never spoke up either. She told me to use her as a reference, keep in touch, come back to visit, etc. I thought we parted fine and would maybe eventually reconcile without the au pair thing between us, or would at least have parted with the knowledge that we respected each other even though our friendship had changed. I never told any of our mutual friends or colleagues about my time there, just that I had to go home early but I enjoyed the experience.

I found out today from a friend that she has been spreading EXTREME lies about me at the school where I used to work, and where she still does. Things like that I participated in non consensual drunk orgies in the small town we lived in while I was au pairing??? I can't even imagine what other things she's said to my former colleagues but I was so deeply hurt. I have never had someone betray me like this and spread such WILDLY untrue rumours for no reason. It's been three months since I left Spain and she is still talking about me. It's not the untrue gossip that hurts (hopefully no one would ever believe it anyways), but it's the fact that we had been so close... a woman who helped me when I was sexually assaulted was now spreading rumours that I engaged in gang-rape orgies? It cut me SO badly and I am just reeling from this. I'm not going to message her or anything because I'm not involved with the school or anything anymore, but I just feel so hurt by this and it has never happened to me on such an extreme level with another woman I considered like a mother to me.

Not sure if this is the right place for this but here it goes...

My parents sat me down today and told me that I have a sister that they never told me about. I am the youngest of 4 siblings at 22 years old with the oldest being 26 and we are just finding out about this within the last couples days. 

My father got his high school girlfriend pregnant their senior year and the mother of the baby did not want my dad involved at all. She completely shut my father out of her life and told their daughter that her father was a sperm donor which she didn’t find out was a lie until she was 14 and even then her mother wouldn’t give her an ounce of information about her father. 

My dad went on and got married to my mother and proceeded to spend the next 33 years (which is how old she is) telling pretty much every adult in my family about it with the exception of his kids. Apparently she’s been trying for almost 10 years to find us/get in contact and just this past week finally convinced her mother to help her.  She decided to contact my brother (not my parents? Strange I know) which is what suddenly brought this all into the picture. 

My sister is beyond mad and won’t speak to my parents, however both of my brothers have already hit it off with her and have been talking non stop since... I just really don’t know how I feel about all of this. I am trying to be really understanding of my parents decisions to not tell us but I just really can’t wrap my head around having another sibling in our family.

“Diversity Hire”,17,dm5kbe,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dm5kbe/diversity_hire/,25,1571892773.0,"This happened to me today and I just needed to tell someone. TLDR at end 

I am a woman in a predominantly male workplace (engineering). I’m a recent college grad and work right next to another recent grad. I admit I was nervous when I first got the job about being one of few women but honestly everyone has been really great about it. I don’t feel I’m treated different and there are enough women scattered around that I don’t feel like I stick out. 

Sure there’s the awkward “okay guys.... and gal” but it’s all coming from a good place. I feel this is a great place for me to begin my career. 

Now this story starts last week but for background know that me and the other new hire (a man) don’t really mesh but we work together often and it’s not a super big deal. Last week we learned of a short term work opportunity and we both applied. I was chosen and today I went for orientation. On the way to orientation my boss told me he’s sad to see me go (I’ll be back in 2 months) because I’m a much bigger asset than male new hire. 

I get back and male new hire is confused why I got chosen for this opportunity and not him. I brush it off... I know I’m a better worker than him and my boss validated that for me today. I tell him I was surprised at the number of women who were at orientation (still less than 50%). 

Now it’s like everything is clear to him, he sighs and tells me “oh they chose to to full the diversity hire role.”

In that moment I was reduced entirely to  having other qualities worth rewarding than having a vagina. I am pissed. I work hard and I go above expectations and I deserve this spot but he can’t see that he’s a shitty worker and maybe that’s why he wasn’t chosen.... no it’s because I’m a woman. 

Keep in mind that he is Asian and literally every person in the room was white so if they really wanted a diverse hire then they wouldn’t have even chose me??? 

I’m sorry for the rant but I can’t believe this happened. It’s such a small thing but it ruined my day and smashed any remaining respect I had for him. It also hurts that he’s the youngest man in the entire office and if he thinks that way still I’m not sure how to feel. 

Thanks for reading if you made it this far...

TLDR: I got a deserved “promotion” over my male counterpart and he said it’s because they were trying to fill a diversity quota. Fuck him.",17

I waited for my ex through 8 months of prison time, 3 months of halfway house (dormitory for felons transitioning back into regular life), and 4 months of doing everything I can for him through probation. I spent a year and a half of my life supporting him, doing everything I can for him. When he was in prison, I wrote to him and sent letters to him almost every day. During halfway house, I would drive 30 minutes to his work, get him some dinner, chat with him for 10 minutes, and drive 30 minutes back home. When he got out of halfway house and on probation, I slept over at his place 4 to 5 days out of the week because he wanted to see me more often. In the morning, I would wake up first, turn on the shower so it's hot when he gets in, gets all of his clothes and put them out, make breakfast, before going back to bed. I gave it my all because I loved him. He broke up with me saying that he can't trust me and thinks I'm cheating. Now that I look back, he was the one acting suspicious. Talking to other girls behind my back, always lying to me, and when I confront him, he would justify it saying that it's habitual and he can't help it. 

After we broke up, he kept talking to me and wanted to see me regularly. He said we were only ""friends"" but we ended up having casual sex for months. When I contacted him after feeling suicidal, he just said ""I don't want the pressure of being your primary carer."" It broke me. I kept going back to him, knowing that he only wants to keep me around for him to talk to when he's bored and have sex with occasionally. But I finally did it. I told him that I no longer want to be in contact with him. I blocked him. Deleted all of our photos. Deleted all of our messages. I feel like I cut off a huge chunk of my life with him, but it feels good. 

I am going to a psychiatrist tomorrow to get some anti-depressant to help fight it. I am getting help, and I am going to be better. I hope I can finally be happy.",16
Best day at work,31,dm26mr,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dm26mr/best_day_at_work/,7,1571878768.0,"Today something happened, that made me feel so good and so happy, i just wanted to share it with people, and i dont know where else so post it.

I have always ""suffered"" from imposter syndrome. I always feel like people can't see that i actually don't belong or that i  am actually very bad at my job.

In 2017 i took on a job that made the whole situation worse. I hated the job but was too stressed and exhausted to look for another one, so i stayed there far too long and it crushed my whole selfconfidence. I was miserable.

6 months ago, i took on a new job. i love it a lot. Im so happy at work that i cant believe i get paid to do this, Im so grateful. A part of me feels like I am doing a good job, but still I am so unhappy about my performance and i constanly hope that my coworkers ""dont see through me"". Its like my brain cannot grasp the fact that i might be doing something right.

Today i had a meeting with the CEO and company owner. After the meeting, he said he still wanted to to tell me something unrelated to the meeting. i was prepared for the worst (because i always think i will be getting fired). He told me that several people have approached him to talk about me and tell him how happy they are i have joined the company. Apparently he has heard from at least 6 people that they are overly impressed by me, that they are so lucky to have ""won"" me as a coworker and that i have raised the bar for future hires. 

I sat there and my eyes got teary, and he just continued telling me what my coworkers have said. And finished with ""most importantly i want you to know that your presence, you personality, your work and outstanding performance is highly highly appreciated. We are very lucky to have you on board.""

I feel so happy, so happy, i cant even explain my happiness. And STILL there is this voice in my head saying ""oh wow, you tricked them well.""

I feel my self confidence slowly coming back, and i hope i will some day truly believe in myself, because i think that will help me do a better job. I am so critical of myself and actually make my own life harder for myself.",31

I hope this doesn’t break the rules. I’m not looking for “medical advise”—I already have the advise. I just need someone to talk to because I’m scared. 

I ended up in the ER a month ago with what I thought was a kidney stone. I was vomiting from the pain. I’ve never felt pain like that in my life, and I’ve had my gallbladder out—gallstones were painful, but nowhere near that. 

Turns out it wasn’t a kidney stone at all, but a 7cm ovarian cyst. They sent me home with opioids and an order to follow up with a gynecologist. 

The gynecologist put me on birth control to see if it would shrink the cyst. I was in severe pain again right after my period this month. I went back to the gynecologist—cysts still there, and no smaller. 

She’s going to refer me to a surgeon because she has a new practice and she’s not set up to do surgery yet. 

I’m crying so much. She said it would probably be laparoscopic, and, again, I’ve had laparoscopic surgery before to remove my gallbladder. It’s not that bad, and the pain of the cyst hurting is way worse than the pain of surgery. I know I’m being dramatic, but I was so optimistic that the cyst would shrink. 

I’m also afraid it’s something worse, like cancer, or that I’ll end up losing my ovaries. I don’t even know if I want biological children, but I want the option. 

I don’t know why I’m post here. I don’t know anyone who has had this surgery, so I guess I’m just reaching out.",8

Im 22f and a little over a month ago i lost my virginity. The past month I’ve been anxious as hell thinking, “what if I’m pregnant?!” I know it’s normal for people with vaginas to experience anxiety like this when having sex the first new times, but my anxiety disorder isn’t helping! 

We used a condom during the actual penetration, but it hurt so much that he pulled out and finished himself off and products of which landed on my thighs and stomach. I’m also very consistent with birth control because I need it for endometriosis treatment. 

I haven’t missed my period, because I pushed it back by voluntarily skipping it with my birth control because it was ending too close for comfort when I had sex. 

After I lost it, I bled pretty bad for a few days and have been spotting off and on since then. I never spotted before then. But I also found out with the bleeding I had two infections. I’m hoping that’s what’s causing the spotting but I’m also afraid because I googled and well, I didn’t know spotting was a pregnancy symptom. 

I’m also super nauseous but, I’m always extremely nauseous so I don’t know what to think about that. I’m pretty bloated tho too. Also fatigued but I don’t know if I should just tie that in with anxiety/depression???

Does anyone have anything that can quench my anxiety or at least help calm me down? I’m taking a pregnancy test in the next couple of days but I’m just so freaked out that I can’t think of anything else.",0

Dating Sucks,21,dm0b22,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dm0b22/dating_sucks/,20,1571870664.0,"I hate dating. Everything about it is so draining and time consuming. Does he like me? Is he dating other people? Should I ask him? Why isn't he texting me back? Am I being ghosted? 

&nbsp;

I've avoided dating for so long. I had a very controlling long term boyfriend in college and once I got out of it I spent years trying to avoid another relationship. I still went on date, hooked up with a few men, and even had a casual on/off thing with someone for years but anything that involved emotions of vulnerability sent me running for the hills. It just makes me feel weak, like I've let me defenses down for anyone to come in and just mess up my life. 

&nbsp;

And then two months ago I reconnected with a friend. I always likes him but didn't want to deal with the emotional fall out of a relationship so nothing every happened. But this time was different. He was more mature, he'd graduated college and gotten a better job, he was responsible, he wanted to talk to me and spend time with me and was telling me how much he liked me and liked spending time with me. And i was really starting to fall for him and let myself open up to the possibility of building something with him. He was even eager to meet my friends for my birthday next month. And then nothing. I haven't heard from him in almost a week now despite reaching out a couple of times and getting very limited responses. I'm pretty sure I've been ghosted. Feels bad man. I feel like a total idiot. I shouldn't have fallen so quickly. I should have been more skeptical of his words, I should have just been more careful. 

&nbsp;

Now here I am, almost 30, running to the restroom at my office to let out a quick sob before pulling myself together and getting back to work. It's making my already terrible anxiety so bad and all I want to do is sleep and get some wine. I was lonely when I was single for years but right now I wish that I'd never rekindled things with this dude. I try to keep myself distracted with school work, friends, hobbies, gym but man nothing is helping right now and now I'm mad at myself for being so weak and dramatic that a 2 month ""something"" is just ruining my days. I'm not even sure how I'm going to try to get back into dating now. But I know I have to, because all of my friends are coupling up and moving on with their lives and here is sad, single little me just trying to get by.

Currently due to saving up I work all god sent hours and all hours I can take at work I’ll have. In order to save and go back to uni. 
I work in private hospital administration therefore I get looked down upon a lot by wealthy patients, sadly it’s the way things are and as and when it happens I tolerate it. Additionally we’re understaffed therefore I do Lone work on a department I’ve only been trained on for 2 days, and I’ve been doing this for around 6 weeks. 

Today we had a so called GP or she claimed she was, we deal with around 113 patients a day, I did this alone from 8-6, bear in mind I’m not contracted so half the time I just do this for money and not the love of work. 
Anywho she arrived 14 mins late, so already the doctors will make her wait till the end, she storms over to me 4 times bearing in mind I had a big queue of patients waiting for me, and she says “I’ve been waiting for too long now I’m not happy, you haven’t arrived me on the system,” I arrived her at 14:33 and had proof of this, so time went on and she went in and was incorrectly referred by her GP. So she comes to me DEMANDING an apology for the error of the GP. 
And well today I didn’t feel like having it and told her I will not apologise for a mistake I did not make, so please provide a contact number and we will her back to you. 

So she looks at me twice with 10 patients behind her waiting for only me to serve them, and says “well I’m a gp considering the amount of times things have gone wrong today you’ll probably mess this one up too” 
And god help me, neither for love nor money did this job matter to me at this point, I turned to her and said “Hang on a moment, don’t you dare speak to me in that manner. I may be a receptionist (a very educated one also, I have been to uni) but you will not address me in that manner, there is only one of me here serving multiple people, so do not speak to me as though I’m illiterate I’m more than capable of taking a number down” and she stoped and had no idea what to say 

I cried after in panic of losing my job, a few patients in the area mentioned that they overheard and I did well and stood up for myself after she was so rude to me and trying to belittle me, hopefully I made her think twice before talking down to others. 

Additionally, as were understaffed, there’s 0 management around when they’re needed. No where to be seen or heard, and I took myself off rota for the rest of the week as I’m seriously considering another role or job elsewhere.

Was anyone else told that their nexplanon implant was good for 4 years?,5,dm6crq,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dm6crq/was_anyone_else_told_that_their_nexplanon_implant/,11,1571895992.0," I hope I'm not breaking any rules about medical advice. Im mostly scared and concerned.

 Almost 4 years ago I went to Planned Parenthood (PP) in VT to get my nexplanon implant replaced because at that time it had been in my arm for 3 years and that was/is the recommended time to have it replaced. There they told me that it had actually been approved for a 4th year and It would be okay to leave it longer. I thought 'cool, but I've been spotting for months and there is no way I'm going to go another year spotting like this' so after some back and fourth between me and the doctor at PP she agreed the replace my implant. A few weeks ago I went to PP in MA to have a routine check in and possibly get it replaced again since it had been more than 3 years and again I was told that it was good for 4 years. Today my sister had an appointment with her doctor to have her implant replaced (we both use nexplanon). she called me afterwards and told me that her doc said it had NOT been approved for a 4th year. I was shocked and skeptical so I googled it. Lo and behold right on the front page of [Nexplanon.com](https://nexplanon.com/) ""Up to 3 years continuous pregnancy prevention"" and looking further on the website I think in the FAQ section it states that the implant must be removed after 3 years. I really cant find any information or studies about nexplanon lasting 4 years, only vague statements saying new research may show it is good for 4 years, and most of those websites or statements were published a few years ago. I feel like a nut but I called the FDA because the nexplanon website gives that number for any concerns, the FDA hours line up perfectly with my work hours so I'll have to take an extended lunch break if I want to talk to anyone there. Id like to call PP but I'm not sure who to talk to, or exactly where to call. Im at a loss. I really trusted Planned Parenthood. Why would they tell women false information about contraceptives?

Let me preface this by acknowledging how lucky I am to even be in this position (even tho I feel weird about that too).

I was sexually abused as a kid, for 4-ish years, by a family member. Due to a fluke in the system, he was actually apprehended (the third time I told someone - my friend told a teacher who told the office who called the cops/CPS) and was sentenced to 13.5 years in jail. I’ve officially lived half of my life with him in jail but that all ends in 5 weeks. 

I’ve moved away, and I’m not necessarily worried about him finding or contacting me, but I am worried about all of the other little girls he’s going to have contact with. I don’t believe in his ability to be rehabilitated due to sexual abuse patterns and experiences I had during those horrible years and I am so nervous he’s going to do it to someone else. 

I was/am lucky. I should be a statistic but I somehow hit the resiliency lottery and have been able to bounce back and be better than I ever would have been otherwise. 

But I’m lucky and that hurts my feelings sometimes. I shouldn’t be considered lucky that my abuser spent any time in jail (and almost 14 years at that) even tho he spent every day of 4 years abusing me and several years prior grooming me. I shouldn’t feel lucky because my justice was served (what feels like temporarily), but unfortunately I am one of the lucky ones and I will never take that for granted.

Workplace Issues during Pregnancy,7,dm4tpm,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dm4tpm/workplace_issues_during_pregnancy/,3,1571889837.0,"Hey, I've never posted here before and am looking for some advice. This seemed like the right place.

I am just under 12 weeks pregnant, and honestly my pregnancy has been horrible. I have been terribly nauseous all day every day, throwing up multiple times a day, sometimes even up all night because I can't sleep through the nausea. My first round of blood testing it was discovered that I am anemic (Which apparently is common in pregnancy), and I've gone to the clinic only to be referred to the ER twice in the last two weeks for a variety of aches and pains in my abdomen/chest/back. Basically I just feel like shit all the time. I was given a prescription for my nausea that I was supposed to take 4 times a day, but the medication causes drowsiness. I went to work one day and literally passed out and was sent to the ER where they halved my dosage. At the half dose the medication is doing nothing, but I can't reasonably do my work on the full dose. If I were able to sleep through my entire pregnancy maybe it'd work, but thus far I am still just as nauseous and throwing up just as much as I was without the medication.

I work as a retail manager in a structure where I have one superior and a bunch of peers in similar positions to me. My retail environment is considered a ""warehouse"" environment, so there's a lot of need for climbing ladders, a lot of heavy lifting, etc. I was asked about a week ago to bring in a doctors note stating what modified duties I require by my supervisor, which is totally fine and I plan to get from my maternity doctor on Friday.

Since I have been pregnant my treatment at my workplace has changed drastically. I show up at work most days, sometimes late because I have been kicked off of my bus for gagging, or didn't get on the bus at all because I was throwing up at the bus stop (which happens more often than I'd like to admit). I do my best to show up, I throw up all day at work, I do my best while I'm there. My peers are frustrated that I have required more sick time for my ER visits, or days that I am so sick I'm not capable of working. I know that my superior has been speaking to my peers about the situation, because every time I say I'm not comfortable with completing a task on a ladder I get asked if I've brought my doctors note and essentially pressured into completing the task, though I've always refused even with pressure. It's not the business of my peers whether I have a doctors note or not.

I went to the ER last Tuesday and was unable to go for my shift due to severe abdominal pain. I was throwing up in my bathroom at home, and upon getting up from a kneeling position I felt a sensation I can only describe as a tearing in my left side. Called registered nurse line, was referred to the ER. They told me to take it easy to avoid stress on my uterus, and to come back if I experience bleeding or fluid loss. This being my first pregnancy, that terrified me. I spent the rest of the day terrified that I might have a miscarriage. I gave a doctors note to my manager, and was called 3 times and told that it's my responsibility to show up for my shift regardless of my doctors note, she also threatened to write me up for not showing up. She also tried to guilt trip me by saying ""I guess I'll just abandon my daughter to go to work to cover for you."" We also had a sit down conversation the next time I saw her detailing how irresponsible my actions were and that in the future I am responsible to be there for my shift regardless of doctors notes. At no point did she ask why I went to the ER, what was happening with me, or show any empathy.

I went to the clinic yesterday during my lunch break with chest pains, and was again referred to the ER. I asked if I could go after my shift, and was told that I should go right now. I was given a paper copy of the referral. No one was willing to cover my shift, I called my manager who is away for work at the moment and her response was ""Well I can't fly home and cover for you, so I don't know what you expect me to do."" and was skeptically asked why I would possibly need to have testing on my heart. They tried to force me to stay for my shift, I called my husband and he told me to just leave so I did. Someone ultimately did cover my shift, I spent 8 hours in the hospital to discover my blood pressure is high which they say is most likely due to stress. One of my peers arranged to have my shift covered today so I am home and haven't spoken to my manager since yesterday.

I feel as if I'm being bullied at this point. When I am at work everyone is very short with me or doesn't talk to me at all, I am constantly being pressured into doing things I am not comfortable with (I always still refuse). The one thing that gets to me the most though, is constantly being told how so and so has a child and when they were pregnant they were able to work throughout the entire thing. I feel like I'm constantly having these women with their seemingly easy pregnancies rubbed in my face and no one seems to understand how hurtful that would be. I feel like everyone is trying to suggest that something is wrong with me, or that I'm weak. I'm genuinely very happy that none of them had to go through what I am going through, I wouldn't wish it on anyone.

I'm mostly just wondering if anyone else has experienced a similar situation and what they did? I have talked to my managers superior, and he seemed very sympathetic (His wife apparently had two very difficult pregnancies) and he suggested a few ways that they could support me, but ultimately wants to have a meeting with me which hasn't happened. I can call HR and go above him, but I'm nervous that my boss would retaliate. I've considered calling government employment lines to see if there's a possibility that I could file something for harassment or discrimination, but I'm afraid they'll just suggest a lawsuit which I am not interested in.

So I started uni recently. A couple weeks in one of my friends from high school introduces me to his friend. We chat a bit--seems like a nice guy. Eventually my high school friend and I leave and he tells me ""hey did you notice my buddy was into you?"" and I said no since I'm horrible at noticing that stuff. The dude was pretty cute, and I had a nice time talking to him so I was kinda kicking myself for not noticing. Anyway, that night I had a dream he sexually assaulted me and when I woke up I felt utterly disgusted. It's been a few weeks, and I no longer react as viscerally whenever I think about it, but last night I had another nightmare where this time one of my profs assaulted me. The guy is so nice IRL, but I woke up feeling so sick to myself and skipped class because I couldn't bear to be in the same room as him.

So how do I get over these nightmares and stop them?? I've never had dreams like this before, and I've never experienced anything that's in them IRL, but they're really emotionally affecting me.

My dad and I were walking on the street. We were speaking Portuguese, we naturally speak loud but we were having a somewhat heated conversation about someone and we were probably louder than usual. I was late at night, so you might not have seen the whole scene properly, but you probably saw an older man talking to a younger women loudly in a language that you didn't understand that has a harsh sound to it.

What made you react was probably the fact that my dad does this ""elbow"" thing when he's proving a point. He will take his elbow and ""hit"" me with it. It doesn't hurt me at all, but I was wearing high heels and lost a bit of my balance when he elbowed me since I wasn't expecting it. He apologized and caught me but you were there.

You came in running from behind saying ""hello, excuse me."" We turned around and you looked at me straight in the eyes and told me ""You look identical to this girl I went to high school with from behind. I'm pretty sure it's you, do you remember me?"" I was a bit confused, and told her ""uh..."" Before I said more she said ""Maybe it wasn't you. I'm not sure it's dark, but she was a good friend and there is nothing I'd like more than to reconnect with her."" I smiled and said ""I don't think it's me."" She just said ""Okay, cool, well my name is Emilie, and I can leave you my phone number if ever you remember me."" As she gave me a big smile. It clicked in my head, this girl was just making sure I was okay.

I smiled back and told her that I got it now, and thanked her. I told her that I was okay and that I was talking with my dad about something that upset both of us in Portuguese. We laughed it off and she mentioned how harsh Portuguese sounds and we went separate ways. My dad didn't understand what happened and thinks it's some girl thing. We resumed our discussion as soon as she left.

So to that Emilie Montreal woman who made sure I was okay, you did everything right. If I was in a situation where I was being vulnerable, you gave me many ways out. You've inspired me. Thank you.",25

For those of you with thyroid issues... does this ring a bell with anyone?,2,dm66n6,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dm66n6/for_those_of_you_with_thyroid_issues_does_this/,9,1571895290.0,"Hi all! 

I’m a 24 year old female. I have a first cousin who has Graves’ disease and a great grandfather who has a hypoactive thyroid - they are both on each side of my family. My maternal grandfather has type 1 diabetes and celiac. 

Three years ago, I went to the doctor for something I was sick, can’t remember with what. The doctor insisted I had an enlarged thyroid. My TSH was tested and I was sent for a thyroid US. All came back normal. I’ve seen several doctors over the years and I always hear “you have an enlarged thyroid” but blood work has ALWAYS been normal. 

To this day, you can still see and feel my thyroid. I don’t have any major health problems, except for what’s listed below. 

Last October, I passed out unexpectedly - never happened before in my life, they never found the cause of it. Blood test after blood test every single thing was normal and functioning properly in my body. 

Within this last year, I have had GI problems. Nausea, diarrhea, BM urgency, lactose intolerance. In May, I saw a new PCP. He thought it was simply from stress with a combination of IBS. I didn’t dispute it. I was put on Wellbutrin XL 300 1/day and stomach antispasmodic drugs as needed. The drugs helped on occasions. 

The end of September, my symptoms got a hell of a lot worse. Constantly tired... sleeping 10 hours a day and still exhausted, diarrhea nearly everyday, severe stomach pains with growling you could hear across the room, headaches just about daily, memory loss where I’d forget things in the middle of doing them, and unexplained joint pain. I talked to my PCP and gave him all of my lovely new symptoms. He instructed me to stop eating gluten immediately and the following business day, I needed to get tested for celiac. 

My celiac test came back as normal but the GF diet has helped a great deal - id say I’m about 75-80% better but there’s still something missing. I saw an immunologist yesterday who is convinced I have celiac, she said my doctor forgot one of the antibody tests, we could order it but I’d have to eat gluten again. I declined. I can’t tolerate gluten in any aspect. She understood and didn’t think there was a need to have a definitive diagnosis from GI. I have no food allergies which is a good thing. 

My PCP decided to test me for hashimotos because he said it goes hand in hand with gluten intolerance and celiac. I did my test today and should have my blood results back tomorrow. He ordered a TSH receptor test and Antithyroid test.  He was confused as to why no other doctor has ever ordered an antithyroid test on me. 

I was looking at both Graves and Hashimotos and was surprised to see some of the symptoms of Graves. My antenna is definitely going off and wondering if this has been my issues for potentially YEARS and am just now beginning to have side effects. 

Does this ring a bell with anybody or has anyone had a similar experience?! Any input would be awesome.",2

So I (F29) have a new job. The first thing I realized was that almost all of the workers are women. The company has two owners (brothers) and one general manager, three man in their 40s. The rest of us are around 30 women and only 2 other men (IT and an auditor)

Why is this? The three bosses like to look at women. They only hire young, thin, objectively pretty women. The manager said ""fat, ugly women shouldn't work at companies like this one"". They make us sign a document stating that we are required to wear black high heels, we need to wear semi formal clothing. They gifted us a bag of make-up, and I mean I was happy about this, I don't really wear too much make-up, but I like to have fun -attempting- to apply some of the stuff I usually don't buy on my own. But then I wondered... Is this for us to wear it every day for work and not having the excuse of not owning make-up?

I rarely wear high heels. I wear just a bit of make-up, mostly because I don't really know how to apply it well... I usually wear a little backpack instead of a purse. But I had to change all of that for this job. I'm not really mad about it, just... It feels strange the way they approach this.

What I am indeed mad about is that a few coworkers said ""we are turning you into a woman"" like WTF no, I was already a woman... Wearing high heels, a purse and more make-up doesn't make me a woman. I AM a woman!

And another thing the only 2 non bosses guys are creeps. The auditor is overly touchy... Grabbing arms and  shoulders and invading your personal space every time he wants to talk to one of us. Always eavesdropping everybody's conversations and making weird comments, always ""joking $of course. Saying, in my opinion, inappropriate things to some of the girls. For example, a coworker was eating lunch, he was staring at her from the other side of the room, then he approached her, leaned towards her ear and said in a creepy voice ""you looked very delicate eating that last bite"". And giggled and then left. Is it just me or that was creepy a f?

The IT guy is no better. And I don't know if our bosses would care about those things since they pretty much objectify their employees from the start.

"Sexism in the landscaping workplace, story time.",15,dlwu9c,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dlwu9c/sexism_in_the_landscaping_workplace_story_time/,1,1571852240.0,"For the last 15 years I've worked the landscaping industry in the Hamptons which is a ritzy part of Long Island New York. I've worked for world class landscaping businesses and architects. From time to time I run my own business. I love what I do and will probably spend the rest of my life doing it. Every so often I get the vibe that a male coworker or boss might underestimate me for my gender but no one has openly said it until last week.

I recently moved to Chattanooga Tennessee and I'm currently doing all the landscaping for a private boys school. The company I'm working for hires a lot of temp workers to pad up the work force. Not ideal but most of the workers are agreeable if a little old. It's safe to say that I have way more landscaping experience than my boss, so it only follows that my boss gives me whoever I want whenever I want.

I sensed an issue brewing with a temp worker and I needed to iron out the kink. He turned me down in the past because he ""didn't know how to dig holes."" This time he ""didn't know how to prune rose bushes."" In both instances I explained politely that I'd show him how to do the work and make it easy for him. He was very combative about it the second time and even chased me down to yell at me for making him do something he didn't want to do. At this point, I still hadn't explained to him what he was going to do. As the situation escalated in front of everyone he ended up yelling ""I don't need a woman telling me how to do my job."" Furious, I walked away and called the boss.

I don't have a whole lot of respect for my boss but I figured it would be easy enough to dismiss a temp worker. Hell, a month prior this guy was yelling at some other temp over asinine bull shit. This guy was showing a pattern of problematic behavior. Monday rolled around and this guy comes into work glaring at me like I punched a baby in the face. Whatever my boss said to him only made him angrier at me. I skipped my boss, I skipped his boss, and I called human resources. Four hours later I'm sitting in a room with my boss and this temp. Having already heard my side of the story my boss invited the temp to give his version of events. Almost immediately my boss had to ask him to stop yelling because he kept working himself up. Without quoting a single word I said he puts forth that I ""said things no woman should ever say to a man."" I can act like a tough bitch sometimes but I never intentionally hurt the feelings of my coworkers. This guy just had a problem with being my subordinate and in two instances brought up my gender as if that was even remotely important.

Tuesday rolled around, the temp worker was gone. I've never worked a corporate job before but the lesson here was to call human resources. I'm damn good at what I do and I never let anything get in the way of my job. Feel free to discuss whatnot, ask questions. I'll be back laturz.

I have felt overwhelmed with insecurity and vulnerability since coming home. However, my boyfriend continues to be helpful and supportive and doesn’t allow me to put myself down with words or negative thinking. He simply reminds me of how strong and beautiful i am and prays for strength with me. 

Well i finally had to shower without my mother’s assistance, and i was very embarrassed to be sitting in a shower chair trying to wash myself in his sight. I told him to leave me there, i could do it myself. So he did, but not without giving me a kiss and telling me i look sexy. (Brownie points lol). Now, i have Always been a VERY sexual person and we have a thriving sex life. So as i was finishing in the shower, i was already sitting so i made a move on him offering oral sex. (Which i love to do). He was very much about a NO saying ‘i just wouldn’t feel right not being able to return the favor and i want to get you out of the shower so you’re more comfortable! And don’t get upset thinking I’m rejecting you because you know you look damn good right now!’ ..... this is one of those ‘baseline how a man should act’ moments... HOWEVER, he is the first man in my life to treat me with such tenderness, respect, and consideration. So in that moment, i felt so secure and beautiful even in this terrible state! 

I read stories on here all the time about how simple things that someone’s SO does that make them realize just how messed up their exes were. This was definitely my moment. My exes wouldn’t have even cared for me, they would have requested oral sex constantly and had no consideration for my feelings or physical state.

Drugs were also involved. Like I said, monster. 

One of things he did to her involved needles poking into her chest, the result of which she now has a lack of sensitivity in her breasts. She can feel general touches but not much else. Occasionally during foreplay the caress comes through like a zinger but most times too much causes pain. Surprisingly her nipples respond normally, though she cannot always feel it. 

This has become something of an issue for her, as you can imagine, and she becomes a little inhibited by them, feeling she is broken and not a real woman. I do my best to assure her that she is, but the thought is firmly placed in her head. 

She has mentioned it to her doctor but her doctor says there’s nothing to be done about it. I was wondering if this is true.

I am also beyond terrified of giving birth, which makes me feel sick to my stomach.

I want to be a mother, but I also feel that my personality is not cut out for it. I've always been a lot more ""masculine""-minded, very independent, strong-willed and dominant type.

Reporting Sexual Harassment. Learn from my success and failures,35,dlnyno,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dlnyno/reporting_sexual_harassment_learn_from_my_success/,11,1571805117.0,"I see a lot of posts on here about sexual harassment in the work place. I have been in this position too many times. ""Just report it to HR""  is vastly underestimating the topic. There is a lot of reasons why it does not get reported. Many times the victims are picked out because their personality does not feel comfortable with confrontation or depend on a paycheck so are willing to put up with the harassment. So let me tell you, no one deserves to be sexually harassed and dread coming to work because of it. I could make this post very long about this topic but I will be limiting it only to the act of recording and reporting. 

Logging the incidents, the more details the better. Remember this is for you, how ever you write them down is the correct way. This is a guide to help you in the process. No one has to see this unless you want them to. This is you regaining some power in a situation where you have had yours taken away. 

* Date 
* Time of day
* Where it happened: Hallway, in the lunch room, storage closet.
* Context: We just finished up a work meeting. I was walking to my car. Called into their office.
* Who was around: They usually begin away from the eyes and ears of others. Once they start getting away with it they work up the courage to do it in front of others. Write down the names of people who were around if they were.
* What was said/what was done: Touching your body. Saying how your SO must love that outfit on you. Your look sexier since losing weight. If you are asking yourself ""is this sexual harassment?"" it most definitely is. Anything that gives you that feeling in the bottom of your gut, record it.
* How you responded: **Do not** interpret  as you needed to slap their hand away, or tell them to back off. When the sexual harassment occurs, it is normal to freeze up and attempt to leave. I know we tend to beat ourselves up for not saying something in the moment but our brain wants to keep us safe. Freezing and leaving the situation are seen as safer. It can even be ""I was too scared to respond and I left the office."" You can even respond after the incident if it is safe, ""I was uncomfortable when you addressed me as '*gross pet name*' please do not call me that."" Use the steps above to also record this interaction.
* Retaliation:  I have seen this in the form of anger outbursts when called out of their behavior. It does not always have to be directed at you.  Feeling like walking on egg shells around them, if they become short tempered at other staff or are slamming objects on desks. I have seen it directed at me by cutting off my sentences or unfairly criticizing my work. It can also be placing you on a schedule you did not request or making assignments where your abuser and you work more closely together. 

You can write it in your phone, a planner, email to yourself (from a personal email not a work one), on a sticky note in your pocket. Keep all the incidents in one safe location you can access if you need to. **Recording sexual harassment does not mean you have to go forward with reporting it. Recording is giving you the power to report if you chose to do so.**

Going forward: If you feel you are at the point where **YOU** feel comfortable going forward you will want to have these with you. You will most likely be highly emotionally charged, maybe even crying which is okay. Having your timeline of events will be more like reading a book. It is easier keeping on track if you have already written it out and you will feel like you have said exactly what you wanted to. It is much easier to write down the events and read them back than it is to recall them when you are sitting in front of a manager or HR. These people might sound cold (what did you do to provoke this? Could what you were wearing be seen as inappropriate in the office?) but stick to the fact that you did not ask to be harassed in the work place. The abuser might be a good worker for the company but it should not cost your physical safety. Your physical safety is more important then what ever their lame excuse is for harassing you. Also keep track of what was said in that meeting and their actions. Also be aware of any retaliation due to you reporting. All the steps laid out above apply also when talking with HR/managers. They will have to investigate your claims, and take action. HR sometimes feels like a wild card. They might ask you not to speak at work about this until the investigation is over. Keep professional at work, take comfort in close family and friends after. Keep a huge separation between the two. Participate in lots of self care, you will need it.   


**You do not have to feel strong, just act strong.** Never once did I feel like what I was doing was brave or courageous. You probably have spent a lot of time going back and fourth about if it was sexual harassment and reporting. There are many out there with your same story. I will even bet there are others in your work place who are experiencing what you are by the same person.  You do not deserve to feel this way. Stay safe.",35
Dropping not so subtle hints to sexist co-worker.,27,dloy2d,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dloy2d/dropping_not_so_subtle_hints_to_sexist_coworker/,10,1571809088.0,"I hope this is allowed but I just wanted to share my experience today. 

Anyway, I'm one of four women in my branch at work. The other 60+ staff are all men aside from the receptionists of which there are 6. Of people who do my job there are four of us and I'm in the lowest ranked position as most of them have worked their way up and I intend to follow that trend. 

Today I was working with a newer guy and my boss. New guy is around 40 as is my boss. I'm 22. I've never met anyone so blatantly sexist as the new guy. Openly admitting he's oggling members of female staff at the site we were at and a few other comments too about how he's got a blister and is going to 'be complaining like a girl'. 

My boss was great. He kept dropping hints himself towards the new guy saying he better not be getting any calls about sexual harrassment in a jokey veiled threat kind of way. He also, when the new guy went off to get stuff, asked me if I was bothered by what the guy was saying. I said I didn't think it was appropriate and that I would take serious issue if he said anything direct me the same way he spoke to the girls. He's said he'll take him aside and talk to him next time it's the two of them. 

After this he made the comment about the blister and acting like a girl and I shut him down cos I was getting a bit exasperated at this point and said 'mate, I know girls who wear heels and get blisters and they'll still walk on them for hours in uncomfortable footwear, and your complaining just from your work shoes? Mate, you don't know pain' and he back peddled which was satisfying. I think I'm just going to focus on shutting him down everytime he says stuff now. I actually get on quite well with him and we have a laugh about stuff at work which is refreshing but then he comes out with stuff like this. 

I also didn't realise just how much of me is numb to these comments these days too. It's just so normalised. The guys at work are generally older and they seem to think I can't do basic shit like carry my bag. Which is heavy but I can manage. I don't need to be constantly asked if I want them to carry my bag for me..? Like I can do the job. Part of me just wants to give them a taste of their own medicine and just be like 'man come carry my bag, I'm too weak a woman to carry it myself' and just really play up to it till they get sick of it. 

At the end of the day I wouldn't be doing this job if I couldn't do it. So just let me get on with it. Sure I'm shorter and not as strong but I'm adapting to it in my own way. Having a back pack over a shoulder bag, making a pad for my ladder when it's on my shoulder. It's making me fitter anyway and I'm more active and confident because of it. 

I don't know what the purpose of this post is. I just kinda wanted to get it off my chest and if anyone has any other ideas or things to add that'd be cool too",27

Paranoid/Need Reassurance,0,dm5omk,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dm5omk/paranoidneed_reassurance/,4,1571893245.0,"Yes, this is the 234982347th post on this sub asking for reassurance about pregnancy, but I have to talk to someone about it, or I'll drive myself crazy.

I lost my virginity on Sunday (kind of--he only managed to go halfway in before I was like 'Nope, stop, hurts.' But I know medically, that still qualifies) unexpectedly. By unexpectedly, I mean it was consensual, but not planned. We've been seeing each other for about three months, and we both want to keep it fairly casual for about a hundred thousand reasons, but he is a good friend, and I care about him a lot. Because it was unexpected, we didn't use protection (I know, I know, I know). He did pull out with plenty of time, and it still took a little work to get him off even when he did pull out, but ... I'm still paranoid. 

The biggest issue is that I am both a hypochondriac and give myself symptoms of illnesses even when I'm not sick, and my periods are incredibly irregular. As in, I've entirely skipped two periods this year alone and the rest have all been over 36 days apart. The last period I had was September 9, sooooo ... the waiting for my period is kind of killing me. 

On top of that, the first time we grinded without clothes on, I took Plan B (yeah, paranoid), and had fairly intense withdrawal bleeding a couple days later (a week after my period). I also took Plan B less than 24 hours after having sex this past week. So there is a pretty good chance the surge of hormones with taking Plan B twice in one month is also messing with my already messed up cycle. 

I'm just terrified that I'm in that small percentage of women who will get pregnant from that, somehow. I have an appointment to see an OBGYN for the first time next week, and wanted to see about birth control anyway to regulate my periods, as I likely have endometriosis. Can anyone give me reassurance, or tell me their own experiences? I know there's also a good chance my anxiety and stress will mess up my period even more. 

Side Note: Yes, if/when we are together again, we will at the very least use a condom.",0
81% of women,1920,dl6sh6,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dl6sh6/81_of_women/,272,1571720113.0,"I'm friends with a group of three girls. Two of them are dating each other (lesbians) and the other friend and I were visiting them at their house for a game night.

While we were there making dinner, two of their housemates (married, heterosexual) came into the kitchen and started chatting with us. The other friend and I hang out at the house often enough we know them quite well, so conversation was flowing for a while.

The talk turned to sexual harrassment, and when I dropped the statistic that 81% of women experience it (source: [https://choice.npr.org/index.html?origin=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/02/21/587671849/a-new-survey-finds-eighty-percent-of-women-have-experienced-sexual-harassment](https://choice.npr.org/index.html?origin=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/02/21/587671849/a-new-survey-finds-eighty-percent-of-women-have-experienced-sexual-harassment) ) the husband didn't believe me.

Cue the ladies in the room chiming in. His wife has experienced it. The lesbian couple has experienced it. I have experienced it. One of their other housemates who wandered in added in that she'd experienced it, too.

And then the other friend dropped on us that she'd been raped when she was seven. She'd never told anyone before that night.

Gents: If you know a woman, realize she's probably gone through a similar situation. If five out of six women have been molested and the sixth has been raped in a group of people who had never met each other before a year ago...

If your lady friends tell you they have never met a woman who hasn't been harrassed, molested, raped...

Friends think I’m an airhead...,3,dlvn2u,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dlvn2u/friends_think_im_an_airhead/,8,1571843650.0,"I’ve been told this by several different people and I’m starting to wonder if I believe them. It used to not bother me because even though they may think that way of me, I felt like I’m not as dumb because they didn’t actually know what I was thinking. I admit I have a hard time conveying my thoughts into words and getting my message across. I think that’s where people start thinking I’m saying stupid things? It makes sense in my head but I guess not to them and most of them time I rather not try and explain it because they either wouldn’t listen or their judgement is already set. Although I can’t say for sure if it’s just me being an airhead but after an incident in which my friend said I “need to learn better street smart,” it bothered me a lot and I started thinking. I don’t believe that in the situation I was in any wrong. When I told another person about the incident and from my perspective, they agreed with me and thought it was also rude of my friend to call me out like that. So am I the air headed one or is it just because people wanna believe that way of me because of how I am?
Then I started questioning do I have possible ADD? I know I can be very childlike (it doesn’t help with my baby face either) but I feel that’s also because of my personality. When I get overly excited with something I like or I’m passionate about, I tend to exaggerate because I genuinely want others to try or learn about it as well. I also do tend to forget things frequently for small things. Examples would be if I’m at home and I’m headed downstairs to do something specific, I might get distracted and actually forget why I even came down but sometimes I’d catch myself to think hard about why I’m there. 
It’s starting to irk me a lot knowing friends would look at me like that because I’m like this, To me it feels like I can’t be taken seriously.",3
First gynecological exam and I feel traumatized,14,dlplhe,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dlplhe/first_gynecological_exam_and_i_feel_traumatized/,20,1571811738.0,"I had my very first gynecological exam today and it was awful. The doctor was quite abrupt, and very dismissive of all my concerns as we talked about birth control. That was frustrating, but I know some doctors are like that. 

I'm a virgin, and I was fairly nervous for the exam, but I work in healthcare and I have a decent pain tolerance, so I thought everything would be alright. The doctor started slowly saying I'm going to put my hand on your leg, now I'm going to feel around and then she just went for it with the speculum. I told her to stop. I told her it was hurting me. She asked if it was a pinch or a pain and I said it feels like something is being pinched, but it also really hurts, you need to take it out now. She kept going and I reiterated that I was very much in pain and that she needed to take it out. I didn't realize it at the time, but I was also hyperventilating. Finally she said 10 more seconds so she could get the swab and I waited out the pain. After she took the speculum out I started crying. Not so much from the pain, but because I was so freaked out. She waited a few moments for me to breathe and then she did the exam with her fingers. That part was alright and didn't hurt, but after sitting up, I had to lay back down because I was still lightheaded, and I began crying again.

Guys, I feel like I've been violated. I understand that pap smears aren't a comfortable experience, but the worst part was feeling like I didn't have control over my body. I said no, I said ""it's really hurting, I think you need to take it out."" Which I'm sure isn't the most assertive language, but I was very clearly freaking out. How can you be a gynecologist and be so bad at consent? This isn't what it should be right? I've been crying on and off since I got home. What can I do?",14

I've been in 3 long term relationships since my early 20s, all with men who seemed only slightly interested in me. I was married for only 2 years when I left my husband because he was an abusive jerk, which only surfaced after the marriage. I honestly thought I was unloveable. 

I met this man, who is 7 years my junior, 5 months ago and he's such a sweet, kind, loving man. He's so much more affectionate than any other man I've been with. He's very protective of me and always wants to know how I'm feeling.

2 weeks ago I had a hysterectomy after having 15 months of pure period hell, which he was very understanding about (do you have any idea how hard it is to tell a man you just met that you bleed constantly, non-stop, sometimes requiring blood tranfusions??). He's been so sweet during my recovery, making sure I rest, that my pain levels are well managed, helping me move around my home, bringing me little treats since I couldn't leave the house. 

Last night he came over unexpectedly with Ben and Jerrys and a bouquet of flowers. I've never gotten flowers from a man before. Ever. I was stunned. The only thing I could think to say (other than a huge thank you) was ""flowers?"" Like my brain just shut down temporarily.  He said ""yeah, for being so brave and strong these past two weeks. I'm so proud of you for how well you've handled all of this.""

I'm still in awe about the whole thing.

Edit: okay, this totally exploded and I really wasn't expecting that. Thanks everyone for the well wishes. I'm recovering quite well and hope to be back to normal in no time.

And thanks for the silver and gold. It was VERY unexpected. You guys rock!!

Edit 2: for those wondering what I do in return....I treat him with the highest levels of respect and like a king. I do plan to get him something special as a thank you, but right now I'm not medically cleared to drive so I'm stuck at home.  Once I can get out, I plan to get him something special.",12513

My company let me go, along with about five other people on a national level, due to corporate restructuring. I know it's more than likely bullshit, but it happens. I'm a little concerned for my job prospects for my future, but I had originally accepted that job, despite not wanting it in the first place.

I'm actually more relieved than anything, to be honest. I'm experienced as a supervisor, but it was difficult to find my place there, and the constant lack of communication, along with the, ""boy's club"" mentality from the guys in the managerial roles didn't make it worth the pay. I had a great team, and I'm very happy I got the chance to work with them, to turn them into the team that I wanted to see.

As for the breast cancer diagnosis, well, I don't know. My GP hasn't said much, but he's been in touch with a surgeon already to discuss removing my breasts altogether, which would be fine with me, since they've been hurting since I first hit puberty. It seems to have been an odd mix of feelings today, and I don't really know how to feel at the moment. I'm just kind of floating here.

My thoughts are a little scattered, but for some reason, I feel like might be okay.

Do LDR relationships ever pay off?,0,dlvc8z,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dlvc8z/do_ldr_relationships_ever_pay_off/,8,1571841641.0,"Yesterday my boyfriend of almost one year broke up with me. I know it might sound silly to get so upset over something that may not have lasted as long as other relationships, but this still hurts me a lot. We both started this relationship knowing that it was going to be incredibly difficult and that we’d have to be patient and communicate effectively. I was hesitant, but he insisted we give it a try. 

This was his first relationship, so I didn’t expect him to have experience, and I was happy to help him and give him advice along the way. One of the problems I quickly noticed, was that he didn’t communicate effectively with me. There were times when we had arguments over petty things, and only after resolving the argument I told him “why didn’t you tell me this earlier? I could have done something”. I have reminded him to communicate his feelings to me many times, but often he doesn’t and prefers to just drop the issue or bottle it up until it eventually causes an argument. Another problem he had was that he occasionally use breaking up as a threat. For example: we’ve just had an argument and he would immediately say to break up in the heat of the moment. This would greatly upset us both, but then he would apologise after a while and we’d be back together again. This happened several occasions, that I had to put a rule to never say that unless you really mean it. But it still got broken a few times.

I know I’m not the perfect girlfriend. Far from it actually. This was not my first relationship. My previous ones ended from me being cheated on and abused from alcoholics. So I have many insecurities. I am also diagnosed with depression. But I try my best not to let it get to me, only on days where i’m especially tired do I really show it. I also liked to be informed if my s/o is busy so I can plan around it, but he seems to think that it is restricting him.

Despite that, I tried very hard to resolve conflicts and communicate our problems so that we could come to a resolution. He would always try to leave mid conversation and avoid/ignore me, but I manage to convince him to hear me out most of the time. Even after multiple disagreements, he still doesn’t try to communicate with me.

Once in a while, one of us would travel to stay with the other. This is where our relationship is not long distance . During this whole time, we are both very happy and everything seemed perfect. We were introduced to each others families, went on many dates, and especially happy being able to show physical affection. Those visits generally lasted a week at a time however, since we both had our work and studies. (For context, I live in the same state as his family, while he lived in a different state all alone for work and that he would move back to my state after his work contract was over) Overall we met around 6-7 different times this year, and was planning more towards the end of the year which we greatly looked forward to. Or so I thought.

It wasn’t until a few days ago, I noticed he was a bit moody. Things were going fine recently and we haven’t been arguing at all. He told me he was fine, followed by “I love you ♥️” so I stopped worrying.
Because our relationship was long distance, we often had phone calls while we did things together. He was noticeably silent in the call and got irritated when I tried to talk to him. Things escalated and it turned into a petty argument of why didn’t he wanted to talk if we were in a call together. He soon left the call saying that he didn’t care anymore and that he was sick of everything.
In my annoyance I said “if you are so sick, why are you still here? Otherwise come back and we can resolve this”. And that was when he said to break up. 
I was upset, but also annoyed. I assumed it was one of his usual threats and chose to give him space. 

The day after, I messaged him (he never messages me first after an argument) saying “Is it really over?”
He then responded with a long speech of how he was tired of LDR and that we were very different people and that things wont work out. He mentions that he’s been feeling “not himself” for months and that was caused by dating me. I was honestly shocked hearing this, because all this time he never told me this and told me he was happy. I later confirmed with a mutual friend that he did mention LDR being hard.  
I asked him why didn’t he tell me, If i knew I would try to do something. 
He told me I didn’t change much since we met and that he was a go-with-the-flow kind of guy and didn’t want to change that. 
I told him if he tells me whats wrong, I would do my best to improve for him (I didn’t want this relationship to end), but he said he wouldn’t be happy if I changed myself for him (which just contradicts what he said earlier...) and that I wouldn’t be the same person anymore. 

No matter how much I pleaded and tried to convince him (we even had plans to meet at the end of the year), he was set in stone that the relationship was over. He didn’t want to try anymore.
Once I let that sink in, I was devastated and my self-esteem was gone. I had tried to put so much effort into this relationship and all of it was gone just like that. I feel so worthless not being able to do anything and that I couldn’t make someone I loved happy. I felt so heartbroken and empty and lonely.

It really is all over. Was it doomed from the beginning? I was really hoping he was the one. His last few messages to me insisted that it wasn’t my fault. But I can’t help feeling so worthless. I was willing to sacrifice so much and dedicate a lot more effort and time to make him happy but it still wasn’t enough. 

People say that if two people really cared for each other they can make LDR relationships work out. But from my experience and ones that i’ve heard of they rarely seem to work.",0
How do I bring up sexual issues with a new partner?,0,dlvb4g,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dlvb4g/how_do_i_bring_up_sexual_issues_with_a_new_partner/,2,1571841425.0,"Very long story short my first sexual experience was quite traumatic and it left me in a very odd position with the man I dated directly afterward. It took me months to feel comfortable enough to have sex with him, but combined with an uncommonly tight box that requires sufficient warmup I'm embarrassed about how to bring this up to my new boyfriend.
There is a small chance that I will be able to have sex, but it just seems unlikely to me. The thought of even remotely casual sex does not appeal to me at all anymore and I'm not sure if I could do it. It's not about wanting it, theres a deeper level of trust I need.  I don't really understand it yet. 
He seems to be fine with taking it slow for now but when I said months I mean ages and like I want to have sex I just can't. 
Sex hurts during the initial takeoff and theres not anything I know to be done about that unless we only have sex during ovulation. How do I bring this up?

I like this guy so much he's so sweet that like I know on some level he'll be understanding its just scary to think about. 

So tldr, I guess I need to take things very slow due to physical issues and emotional trauma and I'm not how to approach this subject. Advice please!",0

I don't know if I am overthinking or if he molested me. I am very confused and traumatized. Please help me.

Very Detailed Story:

Hi Reddit. I (19F) need help/advice. I think I was sexually assaulted by my cousin (27M) a few years ago. A part of me knows the truth, but the other part can’t fully admit it even to myself, let alone anyone else. I’m sorry this is so long, but I chose to keep a lot of details that I felt were important to this. This actually happened during Nov/Dec of 2015 - July of 2016. I grew up in a big family and all of the cousins were very close, like best friends. The cousin, let’s call him John, entered my life when I was about 4 when his family moved to my town. We lived together until I was 12, and although we fought a lot, there was nothing weird about our relationship at that point. John was always somewhat manipulative and very aggressive, but he was also “funny” and almost always got his way. His family moved only a few mins away, so it was very normal for me to go to my aunt and uncle’s house, and I would stay the night often because I couldn’t drive. When I was 15, my aunt & uncle went on a trip out of the country for 30-45 days. I stayed over at their house a lot during this time because John (24 years old at this time) would not come home sometimes, and his younger sister (Bethany, 21) was bored and didn’t want to stay alone. I’ve always been very warm/hot, so I slept in the coldest room, which happened to be John’s room. He slept in his parents’ room anyway so this wasn’t an issue, or that’s what I thought. One night, I heard someone come into the room so I looked to see who it was. It was John, and he said he was cold so he came to my room. I thought this was strange, but I didn’t really think much of it. He lied down in bed, and I just tried to sleep again. Eventually, he got very close and put his arm around me and put his leg on mine, and I froze. He left after an unknown amount of time. The next night he came back again and did the same thing (cuddled up behind me - big spoon). He put his hand in my shirt this time, and his thumb was touching my underboob which made me extremely uncomfortable. I was 15, this was my first cousin, and I knew this should not be happening. A week later, Bethany was pretty sick so she was taking NyQuil every night to sleep. She was already a very deep sleeper, so there was no way she was going to wake up. John wasn’t supposed to come home that night, so I was relieved deep down. Well, he ended up coming home that night. He came into my room again, and did the same thing, except he just slowly grabbed my boob this time. I moved his hand and scooted away, but he just slowly moved back. At this point, I was absolutely terrified. He put his hand on my boob again and kept it there. I told him to stop and moved away, and he said, “Just 10 more minutes. I’m leaving after that.” A few days later, the same stuff happened but he put his hand in my underwear and just kept it on my pelvic/hip area. I tried to get up, but he just kinda held me there, not super aggressively though. I was scared that it was going to get way worse, because if he thought it was okay to touch his younger cousin like that, how did I know he wouldn’t try to more? Eventually, his parents came back, so I didn’t stay the night much anymore, but when I did, he would sneak into the guest bedroom where I would sleep on the pretense of being “cold” and sneak back to his room before his parents woke up. During one of these times, John tried to get me to sit on top of him and I just got up and left. I thought it stopped after a while, because as far as I remember nothing happened for a couple of months. He would randomly kiss my neck and pull at my shorts/underwear when I would see him, but nothing more than that until my cousin’s wedding in June. During the wedding at night, he came into mine and Bethany’s room while we were sleeping because he had a key (long story). I think he was drunk/high/crossed, and he did the same thing. For some reason, I had kept my bra on and he put his hand under my bra and said, “Ahhhhh, this is exactly what I needed.” I waited until he fell asleep and just went into the bathroom and cried. Either he had no recollection of doing this, or he didn’t see anything wrong in actions, just like all of the other times. I never said anything about this to anyone, and I tried really hard to not think about it. I didn't want to believe that someone who I treated like my brother and I trusted with my life would do this to me. I was depressed and shaken for a long time, but no one seemed to notice. I think this was too traumatic for my brain to process, and it was something that has randomly surfaced and I always just pushed it down. Am I overthinking everything, or did my cousin molest me? I need an unbiased opinion, and this might be the only place I can get that.

Also, a lot of this resurfaced for me in the past couple of days and I’m still processing it (delayed recall). Please don’t suggest telling someone/my parents or confronting him. There's a very good chance I won't be believed and I truly don’t think I’m ready for that.",2

Should I have tipped my Lyft?,6,dlijc3,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dlijc3/should_i_have_tipped_my_lyft/,7,1571782541.0,"Sorry if this is the wrong place to put it but I don’t know where else to go.

Last night after work I ordered a Lyft back home. It was pretty dark and I was in a rush to get  home so that I could finish some homework that was due that night and I didn’t have any of my school things with me. 

When my Lyft arrives, he says my name a bunch of times in a weird tone ( I brush it off and figure it’s just his kindness) and he instantly starts talking to me and while I prefer quiet rides, I also don’t mind an interesting conversation. He asks me if I’m in college and I say yes because it’s a pretty big college town and I didn’t see a problem with telling the truth. He tells me I’m pretty and I ignore the comment but I don’t get too weirded out by it. He then asks me if he’s driving me home and I say no that I’m going to a bus stop near my home (a lie). 

I didn’t see anything wrong with the conversation until he starts telling me he loves me over and over again. Each time he says it I ignore it and ask him another question. At this point I’m getting more and more terrified and I consider asking him to stop with the convo or leave me somewhere safe, but I don’t see any place safe to be dropped off. I kept asking him questions and looking at my phone making sure we were going the right what.

I also feel the need at this point to be as nice as possible while hopefully not leading him on. I didn’t want to make him angry with me in cases he got violent. He asked for my number, for a date and showed me pictures of himself (not naked). He said he would look for me in school too. He also said my name a bunch of times and said “Lyft driver loves Kimtaeng, Kim Taeng loves Lyft driver”. He also repeated his own number a bunch of times in a tone that made me even more scared. I don’t know how to describe it but it made me feel that he was being more forceful and i was starting to shake.

When he sees that I’m not taking his number he tells me  that girls of my race don’t like him because he’s from Africa. Still not wanting to make him angry I tell him that I’m not racist (I’m not) and thankfully that didn’t escalate. 

So the ride ends and I go to the bus stop where another guy is but he seems to be young and busy waiting for the bus. I wait about 5 minutes seeing if the guy comes back or is watching me somewhere to get my address and I run back home. I was shaking when I got back and I was just grateful that my roommate was there and I wasn’t alone.

For reference I’m pretty small and also the name I gave the app is not my real name.
I ended up not tipping and gave him 0 stars because the website said that anything below 3 would alert them of a problem. 

Here are my questions: given all that should I have tipped him and given him a better rating?Was I being paranoid and unwelcome? Was it my fault? Was I leading him on? What else should I have done?",6

He was my first love and I believed with everything I had that he was the one. We were going to wait for me to finish uni and celebrate by getting married, we were gonna have two kids and give them all the love we'd needed and didn't get ourselves. I loved him, trusted him, and I gave him my everything. Maybe at one point, some part of him did the same, but I wish I'd seen little signs that he wasn't on the same page before I gave him my all.

1. **Don't be the cool girl.** I see this so much on this sub, relationship advice and so on, but it's a really really hard habit to break out of. I thought I was being chill, not overly jealous or clingy by telling him it was ok that he downloaded Tinder 'just for laughs', or 'to fit in better with his mates'. Even if he says it doesn't mean anything and he's not really doing anything or that it's just for that ego boost, ask yourself why you're ok with it. Because I pretended I was until I pretty much believed it and it really wasn't.
2. **Don't brush off his sexist comments to other girls.** If he is belittling other women whether it's about their bodies, looks, or opinions, he's belittling you. There's no such thing as ""Well, I know he's mean to other people but when it's just me and him, he's the kindest person ever,"" Yes, some people are gentler behind closed doors, but why do you want to be with someone who is outwardly hostile to others
3. **You shouldn't be apologising for him.** If you are apologising for him, something is wrong. You are not on the same page and that needs to be worked out- plain and simple.
4. **You should not be afraid of his reactions.** This is something I regret the most. I was terrified of my boyfriend's raised voice or harsh wording. I don't mean that he was verbally abusive or even overly harsh but I was so afraid that he would be unhappy with me that I never told him when I was upset about something he did. I would just hold it in and hope that he didn't find out, less he decided to break up with me over it. These would be things as simple as being late or forgetting to do a chore I said I'd do.

There are so many other things I wish I hadn't pushed aside. I wish I didn't defend him so strongly when he said horrible things, brushing it off as, ""Oh, he's just drunk,"" or ""He doesn't really believe that, he just thinks he's being funny,""

I expect to get a lot of comments telling me that I was a bit naive for doing all these things, and that they are just common sense, but in the moment, it's really hard to tell what's ok and what's not, especially in your first relationship. I wish I knew earlier what my worth is and that I didn't need to suffer through what I did. 

Part of me wishes that I was the one to end things, so that I could say- You did this wrong and that's why I'm leaving you. Instead I'm sitting here, wondering after everything that he put me through, and everything I silently suffered, why I'm the one that got dumped.

Getting back on my feet after sexual assault in study abroad country,0,dlqm2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dlqm2s/getting_back_on_my_feet_after_sexual_assault_in/,3,1571816159.0,"Trigger warning: sexual assault 

Today marks 17 days since I was raped by two men in the country I was studying abroad in. The assault happened after a night out of drinking, in a public area late at night, and it was violent. The police/investigative unit were unfriendly, to say the least, and held me for 12 hours after the incident. After they realized I did not want to open a case, they sold my information to local online newspapers. My full name, age, and school were disclosed in several articles, right along with details of the crime. I returned home to the States 5 days later-- forfeiting nearly all of the class credits and unforgettable experiences I would have earned if I otherwise chose to stay and complete the semester. 

I still don't know how to feel about my choice to come home. But I do know that my study abroad program was designed to be a little uncomfortable, and after the attack, I craved comfort more than anything-- along with knowing that I was getting the best HIV/STD prevention aftercare I could. I am now at home with my parents for the rest of semester until I go back to school in January. Life is moving slow, and there's a lot of time to just think and worry-- about the remainder of my education, my capability to move on and accomplish new things, how I will be able to explain my incomplete study abroad journey to those who I had talked with before leaving the country. 

I still have goals, but I'm struggling mentally. I am starting therapy tomorrow. I have bad ADHD, and all my negative self-talk doesn't help. I want to become a more whole person during my recovery process, but I'm overwhelmed. I feel culpable for this failed semester of my life, and I feel lonely. The people around me are kind and supportive, but they don't quite understand. Plus, my little sister is very mentally ill, which makes it difficult for me to be able to heal in my home environment. 

I'm not sure the exact point of this post, but I guess I'm asking for any advice/guidance you may have. Thank you.",0

I was at a bar party and a kind of jerkish guy harassed me. He was almost 50 years old, and I’m just a few years shy of 30. I have a boyfriend and I had made it very very clear before I even knew he had any attraction. I’d left to another adjoining bar when he started fighting with me over the relevance of my boyfriend (because we’re not the same race). My friend told me the group had left, and when I got back, he was the only one of that group left. He came up to me and apologized for being so rude about my boyfriend. He asked if my boyfriend was with me and when I said no, he proceeded to latch on to me and started kissing my neck. He was way more drunk than me, so I just easily shoved him off and ran back to my friend (who saw the whole ordeal and stayed with me the rest of the night). 

I guess at the time I was too under the influence to really process what happened, or potentially just focused on getting away from him and having fun. But now that It’s the next day, it’s just bothering me so much. It was so small, but I feel so violated and awful. I’m so bothered by it. Like why do I feel so bad after this? I’ve had waaaay worse experiences, I feel like because it was so short and small I shouldn’t be feeling bad, but I just do. I don’t really know how to deal with it.",5

It's bumpy and not smooth, feels like it has ridges.  I thought it was deeper inside of a woman? 

I'm going to ask my husband for some help when he gets home from work today. But is this a typical placement for the G spot? It's so close to the opening that if I was to open up my labia, you could probably see it very easily.

Moral License and the Podcast You NEED to Listen To.,3,dljalr,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dljalr/moral_license_and_the_podcast_you_need_to_listen/,1,1571786000.0,"I'm a fan of podcasts and having exhausted my normal go-to's, I decided to try out a new one (for me) called 'Revisionist History'. The first episode is called 'The Lady Vanishes'. 

Holy shit. 

Listening to this podcast made so much about politics in the last decade click into place for me, especially how attitudes that *seem* incredibly progressive and open minded can actually be a shield for racist, misogynist, or xenophobic behavior. It was like getting a pair of glasses for the first time and suddenly being able to see the world more clearly. 

I don't know if the other episodes will cause similar revelations, as I've only listened to the first one so far, but it was striking enough that I felt like I had to share it as much as I could. I'm not going to try to describe the episode more than I have here, I'm just going to say that if you care about politics, social justice, gender in culture, and just how hard it actually is to break through that glass ceiling... you NEED to listen to this.  

I listen on Spotify, but you can find the podcast (and it's first episode) here: http://revisionisthistory.com/seasons?selected=season-1

Disclaimer if necessary - I have nothing to do with this podcast and am not promoting it for personal gain, I've literally just listened to one episode and I can't stop thinking about it. It has provided me a piece of a puzzle that I've been trying to put together my entire adult life, and put a name to a subconscious phenomenon that I have long suspected existed but could not explain or identify. Seriously, just listen to it.",3

I was on the verge of having a panic attack and requested to have the exam done on a different day but they were very insistent that it be done right away. I felt pressured and pushed into it.

I don’t know if this is the right place to post this but I didn’t know where else to go.

I haven’t been gaining I’ve been pretty steady for a while now, but I’ve just recently acquired a ton of stretch marks. At first it was just my butt and thighs, which I didn’t love but I was ok with. Then last week I noticed some starting on my chest, and just tonight I noticed them on my stomach. It’s like like one or two on my chest and stomach, but a lot on my thighs and butt.


I know it’s stupid but I feel crushed and so self conscious and just gross. My boyfriend is out of town and I’m worried when he gets back I’ll just have a ton of them and he won’t find me attractive anymore. Idk why I’m still having them pop up either, I’ve been maintaining my weight for a while now. I’ve never had any problem with my appearance before, I’ve always been a very confident secure person and this for some reason has ruined me. Has anyone ever dealt with this? Any idea why I would be getting them even though I haven’t gained weight in a while? And how do you deal with being so self conscious about something.

Ladies who CCW: how much of your wardrobe is designed around it?,0,dlq3kq,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dlq3kq/ladies_who_ccw_how_much_of_your_wardrobe_is/,4,1571813913.0,"[Gosh, I haven't posted in XX in years.

I recently had a wardrobe clear-out (can't say my closet now ""sparks joy,"" but getting there!). And more recent than that, I started concealed carrying.

I carry IWB 5 o'clock. And it works pretty well for my professional attire (jeans or slacks, plain or graphic tee, casual blazer, ankle boots), and a bit less well for my weekend attire (varies, often jeans and a graphic tee). The fact that it's winter is helping, but someday it will be summer again.

The issue is that I'm tall (so shirts ride up and get stuck above/behind my gun easily) and look best with fitted tops (loose blouses and baggy sweaters are my style enemy) 

It's on my mind rather a lot. Is this something that will go away? I'm thinking that as my wardrobe evolves into more pieces that are easily CCW friendly, it won't be on my mind as much.

I need to learn that it wasn't my fault,34,dl98uv,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dl98uv/i_need_to_learn_that_it_wasnt_my_fault/,14,1571730705.0,"When I was about 10 years old, my oldest brother (who was around 14 at the time) began to take his sexual interest out on me. Some of my memory about how it all started is vague, but I remember some accounts of it all.

One time, he was helping me put up a poster in a room I shared with my sister. He took his fingers and put them up my shorts and underwear, until he was penetrating my vagina. Another time, it was late at night and my sister was working. He would come into my room, and pull my shorts and underwear down, so he could stick his fingers in my vagina and anus, and perform oral sex on me. At the time, I was so confused and thought that it felt generally good. Until he pushed his fingers too far into me, and I experienced a lot of pain, but I was too afraid to speak out. 

My mother eventually found out something was going on one day, when my brother and I were sitting on the couch together. My brother tried putting his finger into my underwear discretely, but my mother noticed. She asked us what was going on, and I jumped up and hopped on my mother's lap and said ""ask (my brothers name)"". I just remember sitting in her lap and feeling so safe from my brother, clinging onto her for dear life.

After that, I don't remember much else, which must've meaner that it stopped. But even to this day, I'm struggling. I'm 20 years old now and battling depression, and as I speak to my therapist about different issues, I am too afraid and scared to talk to him about this. My throat closes up and my eyes get watery, and no words will come to my mouth.

One day, I gathered the courage to write it out on a note for him. I wrote ""my brother touched me inappropriately when I was younger"". As I handed the note back to him, and he read it, he looked and me and said ""I am so sorry"". And I just broke out bawling. After that, I told him I didn't want to talk more about it, and he left it at that.

I can't help but handle feelings of guilt. I feel guilty that I allowed it at my age, and I feel guilty that I didn't say no or tell my mom, and I feel like it was my fault. I feel an uncontrollable need to tell no one, so that my family doesn't break apart. I feel so ashamed of myself, for everything that happened. Even today, I love my brother and wouldn't want any harm to come onto him. I need to learn that his behavior at that age was not my fault and was inexcusable. I need to talk to my therapist about this more, once I am ready.

You all are the only ones who know the full story. I have debated posting this for a long time, but I needed to tell someone the whole story. It's been bottling up in me recently, especially as I think more about it.

Thank you for taking the time to read this. You all are truly wonderful people.",34
"To the lady in the white Jeep who kept an eye on me and called the police, thank you for making me feel safe. To American society, we must stop throwing our mentally ill out into the street as if they are disposable.",20,dlbit0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dlbit0/to_the_lady_in_the_white_jeep_who_kept_an_eye_on/,9,1571741305.0,"I just got done working a 10 hour shift. I am a recovery room nurse and my days are often tiring and stressful. Today was different though. On my way out I was bragging to a coworker how I actually had a good, easy, steady day in the area I was assigned (same day outpatient surgery). When I left it was already dark out. The walk to the employee parking lot is just shy of a half mile. 

As I am walking I stumbled upon a woman in distress. She was wearing a neck brace, crying hysterically, and venting to a CNA about what had happened to her (she was apparently in a car accident, seen in the ER, and discharged with no way home). I stopped to see if I could help. Having worked in the ER before working in PACU/OPS, I immediately recognized the kind of person I was dealing with. Manipulative, accusatory, confabulating, all of the works that often come with extreme, untreated mental illness. I was afraid if I tried to leave her she might threaten me or hurt me. I let her use my cell phone to try and call a couple people, but no one answered. I did not want to just leave her there stranded, but I could not stay with her all night and I was not willing to put myself at risk by letting a stranger and clearly mentally unstable person in my vehicle. I would have gladly paid for a cab for her, but where she needed to go was 3 hours away and up one of the most dangerous mountain passes in my state. I don’t think that would fly with a taxi, and I also don’t have a spare $200-$300 lying around right now. 

The whole time I was with this distressed woman though, another woman in a white Jeep was at the stop sign watching us. The distressed woman did not notice we were being watched, but I was aware of it the entire time. Another car pulled up behind the woman in the Jeep at the stop sign, so she moved to a parking lot directly across from us, still watching. She obviously had just gotten off work too, and she could have easily not recognized what was going on and just drove home, but she recognized something wasn’t right, she indirectly stayed with me the whole time, and presumably called the police as soon as she recognized what was happening because I was only with the distressed woman for 15 minutes before the police showed up. 

The police officers were polite, stood at least five feet away from us, and genuinely seemed like they were trying to help. The woman accused the police officer of stroking his penis in front of her when he did nothing of the sort, accused them of trying to sell her into a prostitution ring when they stated, “a taxi will take you anywhere if you have the money,” and accused me of “having the same agenda as everyone else in the hospital.” I politely excused myself after a few minutes of escalating banter between the two parties, but I felt awful wondering what I could have done better. I realized I have no idea how to actually help these people. I feel like I am part of the problem in this society which fails the mentally ill, and I very well know from working in the emergency department that these people are being failed miserably every single day. There seems to be no help available, and if it is available, it’s only for the people who are still functional and able to help themselves. What can be done to help people like this?",20

I met this guy through common friends at a party. He was really hot and fun to talk to. He got my number, we kept texting through the week, and finally planned for a date. I was so excited to finally have met a guy “in the real world” as opposed to on a dating app!

After dinner and good conversation, he asked me to come for his place for a glass of wine. I figured that some making out would be nice and said yes.

At his place, while making out, he couldn’t stop telling me how sexy and seductive I was. I told him that I wasn’t ready for sex, he said OK but then kept pushing for it. “Only the tip, I can’t help myself…” After saying no three times, I gave up and said OK. My body was responding to what was going on, so even though I emotionally wasn’t ready, my body was. I at least made him wear protection, which he wasn’t planning on. Afterwards I felt empty and went home as soon as possible.

He kept texting me and clearly wanted to see me again. If this had been any other guy, I would have just ghosted him. However, I knew that I would meet him again through our common friends and didn’t want to have to worry about it every time. After getting amazing support from my girlfriends (female support FTFW!), I took a deep breath and sent him a text to explain why I didn’t want to see him again. I was so nervous that he would take it badly, blame me for asking for it, and all of that. But instead, he sent me the most thoughtful response.

I had a phone call with him yesterday, which started with him telling me about the reflections he’d had himself and where he saw that he’d gone wrong. I filled in with my perspective, and he didn’t question any of my experiences. He thanked me for letting him know and giving him the chance to learn and do better in the future.

What he did was of course not OK, but seeing how seriously he took this and how he affirmed my experience was the best possible aftermath. I can now leave this experience behind me and keep looking for that great guy that will respect me and my wishes.

**Edit:** I expected about 20 people to read this post, so this has been interesting... I'm fascinated by how much people ""know"" about me and the guy from this short text and screenshot, and the range of interpretations of what happened.

To everyone that's been worrying, I have no plans on getting back with this guy. I've left what happened behind me, the conversation I had with the guy was enough for me to not spend any more mental energy on this. Thanks to everyone who has come with thoughtful comments and questions, it's so appreciated!

**Edit 2:** Removed the screenshot of the text messages, since this blew up so much more than I thought it would. Shouldn't be anything in there that he can be identified with, but either way. And more ammunition to those that think I made this all up, including the texts ;)",7544

Aversion To My Period,0,dlnhd8,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dlnhd8/aversion_to_my_period/,4,1571803252.0,"Hello lovelies,

I was on depo for around 5 years (yes, I know, but it's the only thing keeping my demon periods at bay) and opted to come off it this summer in hopes that I would see:

* Improvement in my mood - I'm currently off work until further notice due to severe depression and anxiety

* Improvement in my complextion - the space on my cheeks, closer to my nose, is red and flakey and my forehead is always angry as well

* Weight loss - I had weight loss surgery just about a year ago and I'm hoping being off depo will help keep it going (I still have a long ways to go)

* Return of my sex drive (not that I have a partner, but I'd like to feel less broken, thanks)

The beginning of September is where my next shot should have been so I've been waiting and wondering when/if my period would show up again. I've had other symptoms (of which I haven't experienced in half a decade) like debilitating cramps (mmm demon period) and super sore nipples, so I was just waiting.

And low and behold, I spotted yesterday and my period returned today and I am immediately reminded why I am useless for a week every month.

Seeing the blood on the tissue... I wanted to cry. And puke. And rage. And now I'm trying to cry again.

Being on my period is just revolting. I can't stand it. The smell makes me gag, the sight makes me gag, I feel so absolutely disgusting (and as someone already struggling with proper bathing, thanks depression, this is NOT helping).

On top of that, my short little t-rex arms combined with my fat stomach means that I can't actually REACH my freakin' vagina and therefor can't use tampons or cups, so once more I'm sitting in a bloody diaper. LITERALLY.

I am beside myself and the full demon hasn't even reared it's ugly head yet, but it's coming.

Is anyone else completely revolted by their period? I've been trying to get a hysterectomy since I was 12 (am now 32, started bleeding at 10) but until I attempt to bleed to death **AND** lose 100+ more pounds... I'm out of luck.

I'm just looking for someone, anyone, to tell me that I'm not alone. It's more than just 'hating' it, I don't want to leave the house, thank the gods I'm not working (no one wants to hear me gagging in the bathroom while I change my pad), and I absolutely HATE that I had to find cotton panties, because my spandex boyshorts are NOT pad-sticker friendly.

Note: I'm well aware menstruation is natural and such, but in my head, it's filthy. I don't feel that way about anyone else who is bleeding, just myself.

Another note: IUD is not an option, I have an itty bitty uterus and zero pain tolerance, plus hormones have already wrecked me once...",0

The other day he visited my city,  we were kissing and he went as much as the second base and I flipped out! I was super uncomfortable. I told him, he stopped for a while but seemed genuinely surprised/upset. We tried again after sometime, but by the end of it I knew I didn’t enjoy it as much and felt really guilty. What’s wrong with me? This is supposed to be a good experience. I enjoyed the cuddling and gentle kissing parts, but not the rest! Even after he left, I am unable to shake the feeling off. Just for information, he is also a virgin and says its hard for him to control (gets a little rough) because he finds comfort in the intimacy and it’s not purely physical for him! Sometime I feel angry that he doesn’t understand my boundaries but I also know what I am feeling is not normal. I shouldn’t be crippled with guilt when I like him as well. He is a good partner, supports me and is understanding as well. Has anyone faced such a thing? What should I do?",0

I am in a long-distance relationship, so I didn't have sex throughout September. However, my bf came down to visit me in October. We had sex around the time my period starts (October 11-12th) and a couple days after that. Because I still haven't had my period and I haven't had sex besides that, I'm assuming if I were to be pregnant it was because of that. I tested this morning and the result was negative but if I were to conceive because of what happened the 12th and that's why im late, does that mean I tested too soon because it's only been about a week and a couple days after sex? despite having a late period for a week? hopefully this post makes sense, I'm very nervous and definitely dont want a child right now.",0

I finally removed a toxic friend from my life and I feel much better for jt,3,dlboh7,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dlboh7/i_finally_removed_a_toxic_friend_from_my_life_and/,0,1571742104.0,"Edit: I'm on mobile, and I was frustrated as I typed, so hopefully formatting is good and sorry for any spelling mistakes 

I've had this life long friend (19F),who for as long as I can remember has been slightly attention seeking. I used to have to listen to her complain about her issues but she refused to take any advice and would just keep complaining I stead of actually doing anything. She'd make fake Facebook accounts, pretending they were her boyfriends/friends that we'd never meet and she'd suddenly stop talking about, one time she pretended to be her sister, messaging people saying she found pills in her older sisters room(my friend) and was worried, but the pictures she sent of the pills, and all her 'friends/boyfriend's' profile pictures were so easy to find when reverse searching on Google. I even tried sending her the links of the actual original sites to show we were all well aware, but she'd ignore it. Now, my biggest issue is how she does NOT keep secrets well. I made the mistake of trusting her with the information of me being bisexual (this was years ago, I'm still mad) and even though I mentioned my parents didn't know she straight up outed me in front of them and then I had to have a conversation with my step father explaining what it was (he didn't give a shit though, thank god for that) and I've never gotten over how I never got to  be the one to tell them myself. More recently however, she texted me fearing she was pregnant. Now, I had an abortion two years ago, which I have regrets for and I've kept to myself. She was talking about having one so I opened up to her on the procedure and how I felt, with the promise at the end that she wouldn't share with anyone. Guess what she did immediately after. That's right, told whoever she could. So I got a fucking phone call from my closest friend, who I had not told honestly because I still believed she was very very Christian and wouldn't accept it, asking if it was true. And thank fuck she was okay with it and just wanted to talk to me because I was ready to fly half way across the country back to where they are and just deck this girl in the face for it. All of my serious issues I've confided have been leaked as soon as she could, so I messaged her and pretty much told her to go fuck herself in a relatively calm way. She says I 'shouldnt let our friendship be ruined by one little thing', but I've never felt more happy knowing shes never going to be an issue for me again. 19, has a daughter that lives with her dad while she jumps from boyfriend to boyfriend and moves in immediately with whoever she's dating at that moment.

Male colleague told me he loves me,12,dl7vn3,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dl7vn3/male_colleague_told_me_he_loves_me/,5,1571724761.0,"English is my second language, so please excuse any mistakes :)

In my workplace there's a guy whom I sometimes meet in the corridor. We usually have a little chat about the weather (it's in the UK). One time he opened up to me and told me about his son's problems with the law. I politely listened and asked a few follow up questions, but I never really opened up to him myself. It was just a friendly work relationship to me.

He asked me out for lunch today, and I agreed as I sometimes go out with my colleagues to a nearby pub. After we sat down I noticed he was super nervous. And then he said this:
""It's clear to me we're in love, so I wanted to let you know I work in other places too, and it takes a lot of my time"". And then he talked for five minutes straight about the places he works in. 
And I just sat there, jaw on the floor, pretending to listen, when in fact my mind was going 300mph, analysing what I'd just heard. I was so uncomfortable and thrown off rails. I considered there could be a possibility of an interest of some sort (which I was not going to reciprocate), but never a straight declaration of LOVE, especially mutual love.

I just don't understand how it suddenly went from friendly waving at each other at work, to him declaring not only his love to me, but also my love to him. How the hell did he manage to skip a few - rather crucial - steps?
Could it be a cultural thing? He's from Africa, not sure which country though. 

I don't think I expressed anything that could be interpreted as a romantic interest. Plus, maybe it's just me, but love is such a strong word. I would only use it with someone I was with for quite some time, after careful consideration, and as a declaration of strong feelings and attachment. I don't understand how someone can declare it knowing practically nothing about me.

In the end I told him I liked him as a friend and that I've got a boyfriend. The last one is a bit of a stretch, because it's still very early days, but I figured it might help to indicate I'm already taken, in case the colleague doesn't respect my decision (which is pretty shitty, I know...)",12

We agreed in court that he is allowed to go to my church (30-40 min away from his home) as long as he stays on the other side of me. I commonly sit on the left side of the church and he sits on the right side (more/less 100ft away from me).

Today he was in the band, playing the drums. Once the invitations songs were over, he walked off stage saw me, then took a seat a few from my left. There were people in the middle between us, but he violated his restraining order.

I told my lawyer and my mom. My mom wanted me to forget it and move to the other side of the church. I personally did not want that as it would still mean he is in control. My lawyer advised yes and I went to my car, unsure if he would follow me out. Called the police and explained the situation.

We only had a modified order of protection where he took off my church, because he so desperately wanted to go back (I believe mostly to stalk me), He didn't want to appeal the whole restraining order, for some odd reason, since his sister also lives in my neighborhood.

Anyways, the police advised me they could not arrest him, but only talk with him. They wanted it in writing, or audio of the discussion of what was stated in court. I did not know that was a thing, since I never received a script of what each party stated and agreed to. I do have a police report number, and a report against him. So far he has two police reports against him as of now.

I do plan on getting that audio file of the court discussion ASAP and get that to who ever I need to get it to, so hopefully they can arrest him. I also plan on contacting my pastor at the church to see if there are any cameras in the congregation area.

I'm just proud of myself of calling the police, despite me having a panic attack and hyperventilating. But hopefully these reports mount up against him for the long haul and he gets arrested eventually.",579

Throwaway. I guess I’m looking for advice or a what would you do. From the time I was 14 until I escaped to college (after some stalking), I was in a relationship with someone 5 years older than me. At first it was the blind admiration of a girl and a “college guy” (though he wasn’t in college) and it devolved into a situation where he brainwashed me into staying with him. He actually convinced me we were so perfect for each other I was the only reason God put him on Earth and if we weren’t together anymore he would die. So I stayed. And stayed. During this time (my entire high school career) I self-isolated. My previous friends felt pushed out by him and were gone too. No high school dances, or parties. You get the idea. As far as my family goes...they loathed him, but never investigated their options to protect me. They simply restricted me from seeing him to 5 days a week, down from 7.  (I had pretty absent parents.)

I felt in my gut the whole time that he was a predator, but I never said that to anyone. It was hard enough to say to myself. Fast forward to the brink of the Me Too movement with women sharing their testimony. I finally had a mirror. I was raped and brainwashed for 4 years. And now, here I am just beginning to work through the hard stuff when I discover my statute of limitations has a year left. Now what?  

I can assure you our relationship was not a state secret and plenty of people knew what was up. I even went to PP for birth control when I was under the age of consent.  He wanted to get me pregnant so I couldn’t leave him.

Now what? Do I report? My husband is supporting any decision. He just wants what’s best for me and I have no idea what that is. Should I just leave it alone? What would you do? I always thought I’d be the type to report, but now that it’s in front of me, I’m scared.",2

I’m frustrated at the availability of cotton products, but I’m also frustrated at the affordability. If I could spend just $4 I would. It’s not fun for me to spend more on something I don’t even want to need. 

I used to just use a LunaCup but I literally cannot stand anything just being stuck up in there for hours at a time anymore. It hurts.

It's a little late but there are reasons that will become apparent. (Usual on mobile etc)


10 years ago I met a man at a conference. We got talking and things progressed. Then he did something no man has ever done, he sensed my hesitation and asked if I wanted him to stop. I thought about this for a second and had all of the guilt that we are all trained to have then I said yes I wanted to stop. He was respectful of that decision and instead we talked and listened to music all night. When we got back home, we both happened to live in the same city, we continued to see each other and when we were ready we had sex. 


I felt so respected in that one moment. That one moment sparked a 10 year relationship and when I woke up yesterday (sunday) morning I got to wake up next to my new husband. I watched him for a moment whilst he slept and was so overcome with joy and love. Then our child woke up and kicked me right in the hips, we very much look forward to welcoming our child in the next few months. 


Every day I am thankful for that one sentence that sparked a lifetime with of happiness. And now I'm crying again (hormones are a beach).",85

We were never opposed to it but it’s just not something we have actively tried to do. I’ve never been on birth control and we never used protection after we were married because we would be completely capable to take care of a child if it happened.

Then my periods just stopped. I went to my gynecologist about it and they diagnosed me with PCOS. Although not entirely impossible they told me it would be harder for us to have children. That’s when I didn’t notice it at the time, but a dark cloud started to follow me about the subject. When seeing babies or babysitting my friends kids, I felt a slight ping of sadness that I didn’t understand.

A week ago my husband started having pain in his testicle (he’s had surgery on that testicle in high school where a kid punch him there and it filled with blood). We went to the emergency room after he woke up almost in tears because of it. They told him he had severe inflammation and while recapping him of everything that meant, they said it was a direct link with infertility in that testicle as well. 

So the likelihood of us having children is now nearly impossible. I’ve been real sick afterwards and can barely eat and stay awake at night when I’ve never had issues falling asleep before. I’ve went through depression before and i recognize it now but it’s just really hard getting through the days. 

I know there’s adoption options and I’m sure I’d be completely happy with an adopted baby or child like I would a baby of my own but knowing how difficult and expensive the process of fertility treatments and adoption makes it really hard as well.

I walked by again and he said excuse me? 

Me: Yes?

Bike guy: oh I just wanted to tell you that what you're wearing looks nice

Me: .... Thanks (goes to continue walking)

BG: yeah I just saw you behind and though hmm let me go talk to this cute girl. 

Me: sorry, I have to go I'm in a hurry.

BG (while I'm walking away, in a friendly not angry way): take the compliment :))


It's just kind of terrifying that he could see me and drive ahead and wait for me. And no at that point it's not a compliment, it's not something to be flattered by, it's just creepy. Like I don't know how movies have this random pick up culture but I feel like in the modern era that just doesn't work. And I mean maybe it took him guts to build up the courage to talk to me but like just no. And yes random compliments are nice but not when  someone waits for me to give them, and honestly even if he had said it the first time it would be skeptical. I know this feels double standardy but I would feel a lot more comfortable with a random compliment from a girl than a guy, if at all. 

And it's just really frustrating cause like in the past few weeks there have been multiple reports of the place where I live being unsafe especially for women. It never used to be like this before and now it feels like my freedom is curtailed. And like what if instead of Bike Guy it was someone who noticed me and wanted to actually do something.

Throwaway account. 

Ladies. I’m all in my feeling tonight and need some advice. My husband is bi... but he’d never date guys, he just occasionally likes the sexual aspect of it. I’m ok with it, I know that everyone has their thing so I don’t judge & I’m not looking for anyone to judge him. We still have sex, I still turn him on, sometimes he likes watching me with a bigger toy. I think somewhere in his psyche, he has a size issue but I don’t have any problems with it! 

Today he was off work and when I came home he was acting super weird. Long story short, he lied to me about where he had been that day, and eventually came clean that he had been at a men’s spa. He swears nothing happened.. but I can’t help but feel really uncomfortable. We’ve only recently got married but we’ve been dating for 8 years... I feel like he broke our vows & he lied to me. But I also don’t want him to feel bad about his sexual activities. I know guys are generally more sexual and we’re a lot more emotional ... I just don’t even know where to go from here.

What made you think you should get tested for that this time?,23,dky9hn,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dky9hn/what_made_you_think_you_should_get_tested_for/,9,1571680933.0,"Last week, I was told by my annoyed GP I am over-anxious and blowing small body changes out of proportions. I began to cry because that had been my fear. Not being taken seriously. Being called a hypochondriac after only coming in once every few months when symptoms kept persisting for months and after doing a lot of reflection if I am imagining things.  I am in my mid-twenties and female.

I have been dealing with ongoing depression and reocurring gastrointestinal symptoms since moving to the new city - it's been 2,5 years now. Some joint pain and tenditis was sprinkled in there, too. Told him about the ongoing symptoms and the problems with getting up in the morning. Took me going to the ER by myself because of depersonalization and too low frustration threshold after depression self-diagnosis to get my GP to realize I am depressed and refer me to a psychiatrist.

Now, the last 2-3 months, the joint pain became partly unbearable. I researched what could be the cause and came across autoimmune causes. Now, I also have Hashimoto's, an autoimmune thyroid disease. Most of my mother's side of the family have it, as well as one aunt has psoriasis. So not too far-fetched. I checked with the symptoms and came to the conclusion: Okay, whatever it is, you don't have to be autoimmune sick. But if you really are, shit's hit the fan if your kidney is involved. That stuff is really dangerous and might really kill you. I checked back with my sister (med student) and mother (not practicing med) after some weeks. They were basically saying ""makes sense. Get ANA tested and referred to a rheumatologist."" ANA are antinuclear antibodies that are ussually raised when you have some autoimmune disease. After I took an attack of shortness of breath and dry cough for something bigger than it was for one evening, I was really cautious, ashamed and started doubting myself. Am I taking stuff too serious? So I only asked for a referral to a rhematologist (which was denied because my joints are not red and swollen and the CRP value from 1,5 years ago was not high) and CRP values (general inflammation markers) at the GP. If the kidney is kicking the bucket, that value has to shoot. Usually, it shoots with arthritis as well, so a reason to get a referral for the rheumatologist. I ask for the value mentioning, I am concerned about my kidney (I have high uric acid values as well). But no, everything still normal. All the while, I keep having Raynaud's (white and blue fingers/toes). GP refers me to a blood vessel specialist (what? well okay. Gonna take several months waiting for an appointment, I guess).

Now, three weeks later of ongoing and worsening pain, I go in for an appointment and ask for an ANA test. He replies ""What made you think you should get tested for that this time?!"" I am stunned. He goes on to say that I am going to do a lot of expensive testing. I had actually researched the price online before to make sure I am not causing unnecessary cost. It's only around 8 € to do the test - terribly cheap. And if it's negative, I get the confirmation that I am probably imagining thing. If it's positive, it's at least a small hint that it could be really some collagenosis autoimmune issue. So he backed up and told me basically, yeah, well, that's right, but afterwards you will want to do a lot more follow-up tests and they are going to be really expensive. And he inquired if I am still seeing my psychiatrist. Because I seem way too anxious. He basically accused me of being a hypochondriac.

I start to cry. He tells me what I was fearing - no wonder I am anxious. I am imagining things. I am costing the health system too much (mind you, I have to regularily go to the GP every 3 months to get my thyroid medication and every 6 months to get tested anyways. In 2,5 years, it was maybe 6 additional visits). I can't stop crying. The GP assistants are consoling me, giving me something to drink. Out of a bad conscience, the GP phones me and tells me I can do the blood test right now, don't have to wait for another week for the appointment. Because he thought I was so anxious and wanted me to do better.

Baboom. A titer of 1:6400 for ANAs. That is really high. You start suspecting something's up at 1:320. Things point towards collagenosis. GP phones me twice (once on mailbox) to confirm that he's sending me to a rheumatologist on an urgent notice.

And I really thought, John Oliver's issue on women's pain treatment in medicine was pretty US specific. I was really wrong. I only imagine that I was 40 or so... I would be the hysteric woman whose problems are obviously either caused by aging or in their imagination.

How to deal with an ineffective manager,2,dl6q6o,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dl6q6o/how_to_deal_with_an_ineffective_manager/,1,1571719837.0,"Not sure if this is the correct sub I’m in need of some advice and this may seem a little complex. I’ve had a few issues at work regarding my manager, it may be that I need a vent more so than anything else. So my issues are as follows:
1. From the moment I started, due to the fact I am an internal worker they moved me to a different department that needs a minimum of 1 months supervised training to work on alone for externals, she left me understaffed and alone for a whole week while I had to ask newbies and others that weren’t aware of my job how to do my job. 
2. We had a complaint from a patient who wanted to speak to management and not me, so I went into her office and she told me to negate the situation, I knew exactly what reaction I’d have from the patient and that was I don’t want to talk to you I want a manager. And seeing as she couldn’t be bothered to get up off her seat and I had to go in again and tell her she needed to get up and sort this. 
3. We have a consultant who is leaving and one one leave and we need to know who the onward referrals go to... again she didn’t think to tell me who it would be and asked me to do the job she should and call around to the secretaries for the consultants and find out who would take on onward referrals 
4. We had a patient wait for a hour in reception one day, and we have a busy area and she asked how long the wait would be. The consultant had actually left, so I was left with the fun job of calling an angry consultant and bearing the brunt of his temper over something the nurse or my manager should’ve done. 
I think told my manager and she told me to “call the secretaries myself” and let them know what happened. Something that really as a manager she should be doing 
5. Today felt like the LAST straw at work, we have a rota and I’m on a 0 hour counteract. My hours are subject to change, however we need to be notified as soon as the change happens. 
So my manager had decided to change the rota and not even inform me about it, I turned up at the time I noted in my diary as I update it weekly as it saves me checking again and again. So I get a call from my mum who’s senior management there also, saying they’re wondering where I am and my shift was 8-4???? 
And ofc I got there as soon as but SURELY she could’ve at least informed me, and she should’ve. I apologised for my error but really I felt so low today, as though it should be her saying sorry to me. 

I really felt like just an admin worker today and that’s all the respect that I’d ever get from this job. I’m working on applying to uni for a masters but I need a year out to save up. And god has it taught me that people can be shit.

They are from Korea but she grew up in the US, her mother has old Korean values and has been abusive her and her father her entire life, the parents are separated since she was 7. The mother has previously said things like ""if we were still in Korea your father would break your bones and nobody would care"". The mother tells her how she has wasted her life raising her disappointing daughter, that it's her fault the mother's life is bad. The mother is often saying that she should have left her daughter (at age 7) in America and moved back to Korea instead. The mother is controlling to the point where she is trying to live her life through her daughter. Last night while my gf was sitting on the floor, her mother came up from behind and struck her 4 times on her back and the back of her head with a closed fist. They had been arguing earlier that night and then made up, so the attack came out of nowhere. The mother can be super loving one second and then switch to a monster in a matter of seconds.

My gf is now at work afraid of going home. They have a joint bank account and I told her to contact the bank to get her name off of it, but she needs her mother's signature for that. Her only option is the withdraw all her money and open up a new account. My advice was:

1. Contact the bank and make sure her mother can't freeze her assets or see withdrawals.

2. Get what she needs from their home while her mother is at work.

3. Tell the mother she is staying at a friends place, but not what friend.

4. Report it to the police, but she doesn't need to press charges right now (you can do that right?)

5. Start looking for more permanent place to live.

Did I miss anything? Was any of that advice bad? Any help is appreciated, I feel so fucking powerless, she is on the other side of the planet being abused by her own family and I am here just trying to be emotional support. What can I do? Help please, she works for a few more hours and we need a plan before the end of the day. I posted this to r/legaladvice too, but I was hoping this subreddit could give me some advice not just related to the legal procedures.",0

Allowing unwanted sexual contact to avoid being raped,21,dku16x,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dku16x/allowing_unwanted_sexual_contact_to_avoid_being/,17,1571654488.0,"I never really understood this until I found myself in this situation. A few years ago I had started going on a lot of dates with guys I met on dating apps. I have always had very low self esteem, and felt worthless and like I owed it to any guy who took me out to have sex with them right away, usually on the first date. I don't like sex, but I really thought it would make them like me. I started seeing a therapist and was upset that none of these dates ever ended up in a relationship. My therapist explained to me that I was under no obligation to have sex if I don't want to, and that I should start trying to go on a few dates before considering sex with them. I had a date with a new guy that night, and told her I was not going to have sex with him that night. 

We went on the date and were having a good time, and ended up going back to his place to watch a movie. We quickly started to make out on his couch, which I was okay with, but when he started to unbutton my pants I stopped him and told him I did not want to have sex, he said okay and we started kissing again, then he went for the pants again and tried to take them off, I said no and went to block his hand, and he tightly grabbed my wrist and continued kissing me. He promised we wouldn't have sex, but said he wanted us to kiss naked, I said okay, so we both undressed and ended up laying down on the floor kissing naked. I was really uncomfortable, but figured as long as it was just kissing it would be okay. Then he said since we were both naked, he was going to put on a condom just in case, but again promised we wouldn't have sex. (I know I sound like an idiot here, I have no idea why I believed him, but I said ""okay, as long as we don't have sex). The next thing I know he slipped his penis in and I just let him do it. I don't know exactly what was going through my head, I had considered saying no one more time, or trying to push him off, but I didn't want this to be an ""actual rape"". He was already inside, I had had sex with lots of guys, this didn't have to be different. In my head, if I said no at this point one of two things would happen. He might listen and stop and be mad at me, or he might ignore me and keep going. So I just started kissing him back and pretended I liked it. I convinced myself it wasn't really rape if I went along with it. When he was done he kissed me on the forehead, got up and took a shower while I got dressed, and then he took me to Chipotle, I think I was actually kinda in shock. 

I ended up telling my therapist at the next appointment after that that I broke my promise and ended up having sex with him on the first date, I never told her the whole story. 

I actually ended up ""dating"" this guy for a few months. The dates usually consisted of me going to his apartment after he got off work and having sex. He kept saying he liked me but wasn't ready for a relationship. I tried breaking it off with him but he always guilted me in to coming back. He said he could see himself falling in love with me one day, and I wanted to be loved so I kept going back. I eventually ended up changing my phone number and blocking him. It wasn't until a few months ago I realized how messed up the whole thing was. I don't know if this would even technically be considered rape because I guess I did consent eventually, but I never considered that someone might go along with sex they didn't want so it wouldn't turn into rape. I'm in a relationship now and I have done the same thing with my current boyfriend, allowed him to do things I didn't want him to do because of the off chance he might not listen to my ""no"".",21

I’ve stayed in contact and it’s kind of a theme that he just pushes boundaries.

Looking for a womans perspective on sex with your partner.,0,dl3crc,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dl3crc/looking_for_a_womans_perspective_on_sex_with_your/,53,1571705557.0,"Me and my wife have been married for over 10 years, up until the past few months we have had sex on average 4-5 times a week. But recently, it's went down to once or twice and even then I feel like I'm almost begging for it. I have tried to get her in the mood, I massage her feet, calves, legs. I kiss on her thighs and rub them, I try to go down on her but she just snaps her legs closed and tells me no. I even do house chores, wash dishes, towels, put away clothes etc... give her a full body massage only for the opportunity to eat her out and she just like ""No, I don't want to""

I'm probably over thinking it, but I'm worried she just doesn't want to have sex with me anymore. Shes gained some weight and made no attempt to fight it, she just eats what she wants when she wants and that's fine, she not an unhealthy weight and physically it doesn't bother me, if anything I love how soft her thighs are. She stopped shaving, like completely, not even trimming it even though she stayed shaved for 9 years its all of a sudden too much of a hassle but again, it's not my preference but also not off-putting. I feel like shes constantly denying her self of what she really wants out of fear its taboo or ""dirty"" Like, I'll eat ass ( when its clean ) 0 problems with it, I finally got her to let me and the next time I went down on her she asked for it and after that time she acts like it grosses her out or something. Like shes scared to enjoy it. Its the same way with anal, we slowly worked our way up to it, she tried it and like it and then after that its a complete shut down, like shes not allowed to like it for some unknown reason.

For me, if I'm not in the mood I'm almost always willing to get in the mood, like back when she wanted it, sometimes more often than me she would just give me head and even though I wasn't in the mood I'm like, why would I turn down head? So I'd let her, obviously and then we would have sex again. But now it's like, she won't even let me get her in the mood, its as if shes so set on not having sex for some reason she won't allow her self to be put in the mood.

If she done most or a lot of the work during sex I could understand it, being tired or sore maybe. But I do easily 90% of the work and she just has to lay there. I don't get it.

How to get tampons in college bathrooms?,1,dl3280,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dl3280/how_to_get_tampons_in_college_bathrooms/,6,1571704323.0,"TL;DR who should a college staff member contact to get tampons and pads put in bathrooms on campus? Or at least make them available at the nurse's office.

Hello there! I'm a staff member at a college (was previously a student at the same college), and I want to try to get pads and tampons put into all the bathrooms. There are super old dispensers in some of the women's, but they're always empty or jammed. There are also no supplies in the nurse's office on campus.

When I was a student, I emailed a staff member asking if we could put baskets of supplies in bathrooms since it's a huge inconvenience to students; he had no idea that those supplies weren't readily available on campus (shocker). Nothing really came of it because I was writing a thesis and was too busy to push the issue, but a couple years later, once I was no longer a student, there were small baskets of supplies put in a few bathrooms. They quickly disappeared and I haven't seen them since. Our sister colleges have had these supplies in all their academic buildings for the last few years, which is where I got the idea from in the first place.

Now that I'm staff, the issue is even more apparent because I can't just leave an 8 hour workday to drive home or to a CVS if I'm not prepared. Our college is small and very liberal so it's actually pretty odd that this hasn't even been brought up yet, and I have some hope that it'll happen if it is brought up. We also just had campus-wide initiative to transform some of our bathrooms into gender neutral spaces, which seems like a much tougher battle financially and politically. Basically, should I contact our staff association about this? Office of student life? Student government? HR? I'm new to the adult world and have no idea who to even mention this to without getting some sort of backlash or reputation...",1

It’s been a relief, and honestly I’ve learned to celebrate my quirks and I am proud of who I am.
 
Where I need help is job or career. I have had a long history of difficulty in the workplace that has nothing to do with my intelligence or ability. Like a lot of autistics, there are things in the workplace that are a BIG problem for me:
I have major executive function issues. If I have to do a LOT of face to face interaction as a key part if my job, I become exhausted and literally just have a total mental breakdown eventually. I was a teacher for 10 years and left because of it. I’m currently working as an online teacher, and while it’s better, I desperately need to find something quieter with less interaction, but I don’t know what. It’s made worse because my job has increasingly been hard to get classes booked for most of the teachers and I’m not making enough money to survive. 

I’m stuck trying to figure how what I could do that works with being autistic. Something where I can work quietly would be ideal, or simply less interaction than teaching for 6-8 hours a day. 

I love jewelry making and I’ve had an Etsy shop but sadly, because jewelry is such a saturated market, I don’t make many sales even though I get complimented on my work.

I really enjoy writing and I’m good at it, but I don’t quite know how I could make that a career, but would be open to it. I enjoy writing non fiction, articles, blog type stuff. Not fiction.

I am terrible at math so anything involving a lot of it isn’t the right fit.

I cannot do food service due to having celiac and it not being safe for me to handle or be around gluten.

I am open to suggestions of all kinds. I just want to be successful and happy doing some kind of full time work and I’m getting depressed worrying if I’ll find something I can do.

On Learning Not to Apologize for Having My Period,7832,dk6vow,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dk6vow/on_learning_not_to_apologize_for_having_my_period/,511,1571535083.0,"I am an 18 year old attending a large university in the US. Historically, I am the type of girl that will not say no to anything sexual. If a guy asks, then I will feel guilty, say “I don’t know,” eventually give in, and then afterwards feel extremely shameful for what I had done. I don’t know exactly where this comes from- I was raised in an extremely sex-positive family. We regularly talked about sex at the dinner table, and being raised atheist I was never preached to about the sins of pre-marital sex. I am afraid of letting people down, and in my mind, saying no to sex is letting someone down.

I have been having casual sex with a couple guys since coming to school. Recently I met a new guy through a friend from one of my classes, and we have been having sex. Earlier this week, we chatted and planned to hangout (aka have sex) on Friday. I was really looking forward to it because he is a really nice guy and I genuinely enjoy spending time with him (and, you know, the sex is good). Friday rolls around, and I wake up to my period. Immediately I was like “Fuck! \[boy\] is going to be so angry!” My roommate is my best friend, so I went to her and explained the situation. I was thinking that I should just snapchat \[boy\] and tell him that I can’t hangout because of my period. She told me to just hangout with him anyway, and tell him when he got to our house. I was really afraid that he was going to feel like I had tricked him by getting his hopes up and he would get upset and just leave. I listened to her advice, and \[boy\] came to our place around 4. We were just chatting on my bed when he said “oh, I completely forgot a condom” and I responded “well, I’m on my period anyway.” And what did he do? Well, he **didn’t** storm out immediately and call me dumb, and then proceed to ghost me like I assumed he would. Instead, he said “Aw, I’m so sorry to hear that. Are you doing okay?” All I wanted to do in that moment was apologize. I wanted to apologize for HAVING A BODILY FUNCTION. We do not need to apologize for a very natural thing that we women have NO CONTROL over. The words “I’m so sorry” were on the tip of my tongue the whole time we were hanging out, but I didn’t say it once. There was absolutely nothing to apologize for. Instead of having sex, we cuddled and watched Netflix for two hours and then we went to go get dinner together with our friends. It was a really awesome time, and I am so proud of myself for not apologizing. **We do not owe sex to men (or anyone)-** and we absolutely should not apologize when something outside of our control prevents us from having sex. Or if we just don’t want to have sex. **Never ever ever feel bad.**",7832

One of my doctors recommended an IUD because the hormones in it are not likely to cause clotting and it's long lasting. Unfortunately I like to google all the horrible things that can happen and now I've scared myself. I was just wondering if any of you had/have had an IUD and what your thoughts were?

Did placement hurt? Were there any awful side effects you wish you'd known about beforehand?

"Not My Rape, Not A Witness, Still Sent My PTSD And Head Into A Spiral",3,dkw3ft,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dkw3ft/not_my_rape_not_a_witness_still_sent_my_ptsd_and/,0,1571666376.0,"I don't know if this is the right place to post.

Let me preface by saying I have been a victim of sexual assault, so has my siblings and I's mother when she was a teenager. Our mother has also lied while I was a young adult and my brothers were preteens/teenagers about being raped leading to someone losing their job/as well as their whole career just for the accusations being placed upon him and because of the field he was in. So my brothers' views of potential victims claims can be called into question sometimes.

Yesterday morning my brother, (we'll call him M) came home from hanging with friends/neighbors the night before. He busted into my husband's and I's room freaking out that [Male neighbor] is not allowed at our house anymore.

I thinking that he stole something off my brother while he was asleep asked innocently, ""Why what did he do?"" My brother M then begins to explain that last night while he and the neighbors/his friends were drinking he got so drunk and passed out in one of the beds next to [female neighbor] who also passed out. He woke up around 3 am with what he thought (was still extremely wasted) [male neighbor] having sex with [female neighbor] damn near on top of him. So he decides to just get out of there for a minute and have a cigarette outside. He comes back in and into the room and [female neighbor] is crying. He asks what was wrong. Apparently [male neighbor] had been raping her. I upon hearing this start freaking out a bit and asking if she went and filed a report with the police and where she was at, I want to talk to her about it, hug her and give her my sympathies for what happened. My brother says right now she is not willing to file a report and my husband butts in saying that don't try to talk to her about it unless she opens up to you first. Ok fair enough I calm down and ask M if anything happened after. My brother M goes on to explain that upon hearing this he goes full rampage beating the crap out of [male neighbor] and almost throwing him over the balcony before he snapped back to his senses.

M is/was fucked up from this...rightfully so.

The thing is the poor girl's rape claim is now being called into question by a few people. Once including M and also other brother (B) who is also friends with both.

M questioned it to my husband and I because of the way she was acting after. He said that she was acting fine. Laughing, smiling throughout the last two days and just giving M special treatment, giving him food, cigarettes, taking him and her brother to the movies.

I, as a previous sexual assault victim to multiple people explained that she might've just not processed it or just wants to ignore it. Husband adding that she might not want to face it and is just tdd trying to move on, and the reason why she's giving M the special treatment was because he beat up her rapist and she's trying to acknowledge and thank his heroism in some way.

Later on after that my brother B was on the porch with a few friends who's none of them I could see their faces since they were turned opposite of me, I had went out to get B for something. I ask B to come back in for a minute and ask him who was all on our porch. The first name out of his mouth was [male neighbor]. I freaked out a bit and asked him if he knew what happened with him this weekend. B says yes, but he thinks [female neighbor] is lying. Now B has a huge crush on [female neighbor], I know it, my husband knows it, M knows it. I being curious of his knowledge/opinion of this whole thing that he wasn't even there when it happened asked why he thinks that.

B goes on to say because [Female neighbors] story keeps on changing and [male neighbors] story does not. Ok big red flag to me. I don't know what to say for a minute I look at my husband he stares back. Finally a thought pops into my head. I ask B what does [Female neighbor] say in her different versions. B says that she said that her brother (who was in the house) was in two different places then he was that her grandma (also in the house) was in two different places then she was. The thing is though the main part of it stayed the same from what I got. I then ask B, ok what does [male neighbor] say? B replies, ""That they were all just smoking up."" I ask, ""What about the sex?"" B replies, ""They didn't have any"". I look at B in astonishment ""Ok...you know there was a third person in the room right? A third testimony. Our brother M, he was in the room. At the very least they had sex, because they were on top or at the very least almost on top of him while he was asleep and then woke up when it happened."" My husband then says ""If he's not even admitting now they had sex that's a red flag right there. We know for a fact they had sex. M was in the room and he went downstairs and told [female neighbors] brother ""that he got them cheeks"" afterwards but the thing that comes into question is whether it was consensual or not. And the fact he's not even saying that is suspicious.""

B begins to look upset and we start talking about why certain details might change in [female neighbors] story and why her demeanor hasn't changed. I explain that with sexual assault victims sometimes their stories small details may change revolving around the incident itself and sometimes people can't or won't fully face up to something like that immediately if ever.

I go on to give my own example of the first sexual assaults I went through with my first attacker and how I was only 5 when it started and it went until I was 9. I explain that in my 1st through 3rd grade classes we had journals in school which we wrote in either everyday if not what we did over weekends/school breaks for writing prompts. I explain that on the days the assaults would happen I would make up details and information to pad my day and not making it suspicious that something happened.

I explain to him that in her case instead of not wanting to admit it to other people this might be a sign she can't/won't fully process what happened. My husband says that it's not our job to tell him what to do/think but his own and that we're just trying to make sure he has all the information to figure out if he still wants to be friends with [male neighbor]. B goes out grumbling. My husband says that he thinks that B is more upset that [male neighbor] and [female neighbor] had sex rather then [male neighbor] might've raped [female neighbor].

I am disgusted if that is the case. B is now treating me like crap while poor M is coming to me for advice for his PTSD for what he witnessed. I am about to have a meltdown in my house because M particularly doesn't want to see [male neighbor] let alone him be on our property, B still wants to be his friend, thinking that he's done nothing wrong and is going to try to keep him coming over. I don't want the guy anywhere near my house if there's nothing disproving [female neighbor] is telling the truth. I am currently just disgusted and upset that B is taking his word over hers without questioning more. Proud that M immediately took action. Sad for the poor girl for what happened to her and that she might not be able to fully process it and being called a liar.

Sorry that this is so long and thank you all for letting me process my as well as my households inner turmoil and sorry that I am so upset about something as horrible as a rape I didn't go through.",3

We have been constantly fighting for the last year - after he went through a lot of my personal things without asking, and found out about my promiscuous past, which I had not been upfront about. I find him very difficult to talk to him, as he takes an accusatory route, but I've been open to trying to work through it. He's called me a lot of names in the process, and I got to the point where I felt so low and worthless with these fights that I finally had the courage one day to end it.  This made him 'see the light' and he changed, stopped accusing me, and I felt crazy for ending it. We still talk a lot, he is my best friend because of everything that we've been through, we even kept sleeping together for a while.  I've recently 'put my foot down' and told him I just don't feel close to him, because I just don't feel the connection when we're sleeping together - I feel like it's often me just trying to make him happy. So I've been waiting to feel that connection with him before I do anything sexually again.  For what it's worth, I do think there's a chance we could get back together so long as he continues to improve. We had another long discussion and he's accusing me of just dragging all of this out and he can't believe that I don't feel a connection, especially since I've been flirting with him.  I am trying to rebuild a healthy relationship with us - but I feel like I'm not being respected.  Am I leading him on or am I in the right to take the time that I need?  I feel so confused.",2

Am I even able to press charges?,6,dkqcy4,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dkqcy4/am_i_even_able_to_press_charges/,8,1571636513.0,"Ok so this is a long, messed up story. Sorry in advance. But I'll start at the beginning. 

I have an older half brother who is 7 years older than me. We share a father, and he'd come over every weekend or so. Well, beginning at the age of 5 or so, my brother sexually assulted me. It started with just probing fingers but eventually led to rape. And this happened until i was about 13 or 14 years old. He threatened me many times that he'd kill me or my parents if i told and even made a homemade ""bomb"" once(i really dont know if it was a real bomb or not - I was about 7 at that time). So i never told. 

The first time he actually put himself inside me, I obviously bled and told my mom i was bleeding. She took me to the doctor, and the doctor immediately asked if id been touched and I lied and said no i fell on my bicycle and the seat went between my legs. She took my mom into the other room and I'm sure told her I'm too young for menstruation and that she assumed id been touched, but it was never brought up again. 

Eventually my brother stopped coming over and just starting living his own life. He got really bad into drugs and other criminal activity so we don't see him much. 

Fast forward to this summer, and he tries to kill his daughters mother. She pressed charges and he's got three 3rd degree domestic assault charges and is looking at 7 years on each of those charges. Well when this happened, I ended up telling his daughters mother what happened to me and she said he did similar things to her throughout their relationship. She talked to him about it once, and he admitted to raping me over and over again. 

My question is: is it too late to press charges? I'm 26 now so it's been 10+ years since the last time he touched me, but hes admitted it. Is there a statute of limitations on this sort of thing? 

I have since told both my parents and am in multiple therapies. I have extreme flashbacks that can take over my day and put me into a deep depression. I've been diagnosed with PTSD (obviously) and Borderline Personality Disorder. Im also hoping to start EDMR therapy in the future but just waiting on the go ahead from insurance. So I have my mental health together as well as I think I can right now, but I really would like to have justice served. But i really feel as if it's too late and I'll live with the fact I didn't tell anyone for 20 years.",6

While I don't have any problems with having a woman's body, it still bothers me that I can't seem to get the hang of looking like a stereotypical woman. Personally, I feel awkward and uncomfortable when wearing makeup and flattering/revealing clothes. Even with long hair, I can't help but think I look like a man in drag; it doesn't help that I'm plain/below average in regards to my looks. I just feel like a lost cause.

I just want to feel comfortable in my own skin without others either pressuring me to conform or making me feel bad for marching to the beat of my own drum. It really hurts knowing that people only think I look nice when the things that make me look good are superficial. And once I start trying to show signs of improvement, everyone will expect me to either keep up the facade or try to meet even more unrealistic standards. Eventually, I just get burned out and regress to my former state because it's too much to handle.

Maybe I'm just not cut out for being an attractive woman, and I've come to terms with being ugly. Not everyone is good-looking, after all. No matter how much people try to tell me I supposedly look attractive, it's up to me to truly believe it for myself. Personally, I know I'm ugly. No matter how much I try to improve my looks, there will always be someone prettier. So fuck it: I'm just gonna do my own thing even though I'll just disappoint everyone in my life.",2
Have any of my reddit sisters out there proposed to their partner?,9,dkpllv,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dkpllv/have_any_of_my_reddit_sisters_out_there_proposed/,14,1571633254.0,"Hello reddit sisters! I’m coming to you for advice, a safe place to vent, and wondering if anyone out there can relate to me on this. My (28F) partner (31M) and I have been in a monogamous relationship for 5.5 years. It’s always been a pretty non-traditional partnership. We both like to defy “typical” gender roles, and we disagree with many of society’s expectations of a relationship. One of those things being “who should ask the other to marry them.” 

A week and a half ago, I asked my man if he would marry me, he said yes (🥳), and I put a ring on his finger. 

The thing that I am here to vent about is this: my man is not quick to show excitement about most things - he’s very stoic and even keel. Since the day that I proposed to him, he hasn’t initiated any conversation about what he wants the wedding to be like, when we should share the news with our loved ones (you’re the first people I’ve told this to), or any other details relating to the wedding. I was also hoping for some sort of reciprocated celebration the day or two after the proposal (coming home to flowers after work or a bottle of champagne or something), but after realizing he had no plans to do this....I plainly asked him for it. 

Do you ladies think I’m being unreasonable in my expectations? Could there could be some completely subconscious emasculation that he’s contending with after being proposed to by his partner? Is it just that he doesn’t know how to begin the conversations about planning? Should I just disregard my wishes for him to initiate these talks and start them myself?? I don’t have any girlfriends who have been the one to propose, so I’m turning to you to see if you can relate. Thanks for listening, and thank you for any advice you may have! 

TL;DR - I proposed to my man, he said yes, we are now “engaged” - but he isn’t showing any excitement towards the idea of planning a wedding.",9
I have a chance to leave my abuser,13,dkn4lz,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dkn4lz/i_have_a_chance_to_leave_my_abuser/,30,1571623121.0,"I’m 34 and I’ve been with my abuser for the past 5 and a half years. I thought I did everything right. Dated for a year before moving in together. Waited another year before I moved with him out of state for his job. I have two kids (9 &11)  from my late husband and they adored him.

Once the move out of state happened it was like a switch flipped. He screamed at me, would say that boundaries were only a way to hurt him, threaten to kill himself if something didn’t go his way, corner me and scream at me while all I could do was shake in fear. He didn’t let me get a job for three years I didn’t have any friends for two years. All of my savings had been spent in the move and without a job I had no way of getting my own place because of moving costs.

But about a year ago I started going out, meeting people. I’m on a job hunt now. And he senses he’s losing control and it’s escalating. He’s hitting, kicking, and throwing things. During one of his tantrums the cat toy he threw (that he had stepped on and set him off) hit my cat. Thankfully she was ok. But I could see it escalating even more.

So I started looking for an apartment, even a small one that I could afford. They didn’t exist in the area I’m in. I have a small income from my late husband’s survivor’s benefits so I’m lucky. But I’ve been searching for months and nothing. Until this past week. A rental popped up with a massive discount if you did your own repairs and maintenance. I’ve owned a home previously and I’ve done most usual household things so I booked a showing immediately.

It’s a dump. The last tenants left it a wreck. An absolute disaster. It’s all stuff I can fix but needs so much. I’m talking the floors need refinishing, holes in the drywall, the heat pump is currently malfunctioning, the stove is a POS. But it’s a great size in an amazing neighborhood and my kids could still go to the same school. Which means a lot that their lives wouldn’t get too upset. It’s also freedom from a man who has been making me so miserable I was literally under doctor’s orders to go to the domestic violence center for help.

But am I just trading the devil I know for the devil I don’t? Is it right to uproot my kids from a nice townhouse to a dump just so I don’t get yelled at anymore? I’m terrified now. I feel selfish for wanting this shitty place. My friends have offered to help but I feel so bad for needing help.

I have some time to think about it but I’m frozen right now.

TL;DR Abused for years. Can’t afford apartments in my city. Found one but it’s a serious shithole. Feeling selfish for uprooting kids from nice place to a dump because I don’t want to get abused anymore.",13

Unfortunately, many in my female social network seem to be stuck in a similar place, and I worry that there's only so much support they can offer and I don't want to exhaust my kind friends. They have been a little absent lately too. I'm in counseling. My first relationship was sexually and physically abusive, and unfortunately some childhood trauma and isolation prevented me from realizing this. I got out because I moved to college. My second relationship of five years was emotionally abusive; I was deeply caught up in the love bombing/withdrawal cycle and also thought everything was my fault, but when he threatened suicide and I realized I was in way over my head and finally cut contact. After being single for a little while and regaining (I thought) my self-esteem and confidence, I got into a highly controlling relationship with someone whom I thought really loved and cared about me. I moved in with him because I needed somewhere to live and am anxious living with strangers, but I was coerced sexually and financially and it ended up derailing my career goals for a while. He wanted to marry me to get on my health insurance, never wanted to meet my family, yet often forcefully talked about how parents should give us money so we could buy a house together, and that his happiness depended on this. After three years of dealing with the yelling, name-calling, manipulation, suicidal undertones, isolation, and gas lighting, I moved out because time was running out for a career determining exam and my friend also stepped in to save me. I later found out that he sexually assaulted another dear friend and when she tried to confront him about it, he yelled at her and said he can't help his sexual feelings and actions. He said that to me many times too and I put up with it out of fear, and because I lived with him and wanted to keep the peace. I'm now largely free of his influence, did well on my exam, and in a good position to move on with my life. But I am still struggling with so much emotional residue, and paradoxically still have feelings for this person who hurt me and my friend so much. I know I am culpable for my decision to be in relationships with hurtful people, and am trying to work on my needs and behaviors that have allowed me to fall for these things over and over again. But I have a lot of trouble standing up for myself and instead have a stronger drive to take care of other people. But I am now feeling ashamed and distrustful of my judgement, afraid of people, and need help breaking out of this. Mental health issues have been preventing me from sticking to healthy hobbies and building platonic relationships, but I'm trying to fight it. I was hoping other women who have experienced something like this could share how they were able to build a stronger self. Thank you for reading.",2
Worried About Having to Choose Between my Husband and my Family,3,dkqqyz,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dkqqyz/worried_about_having_to_choose_between_my_husband/,7,1571638235.0,"This is the first time I've told this story pretty much in full, so bear with the details I feel it might help... Sorry for the long post!!

As of September, my husband and I have been married for 4 years, together 8. In the 4 years we've been married, we've had 2 babies, bought 2 houses (one is our primary home that needed major renovations and the other one is a piece of income property), moved into my parents house, I was diagnosed with RA and another autoimmune disease, and I've lost 2 major pieces of my life: my nana and my dog. Needless to say it's been an absolute whirlwind. 

Last Christmas, my world came crashing down on me. I realized that my husband had developed a serious drug problem and was taking money from me. My husband and I started a mildly successful painting company. He was working as much as he could, doing high end homes, even working at NFL players' homes. I also work full time as a high school teacher. Our lives are very busy, and I had rough pregnancies where I was pretty pukey sick most of the time. He had a lot of freedom in his job but I think having access to things like that on a regular basis (when some people sell houses or leave rentals, the leave lots of stuff behind sometimes, including drugs). He was (and still is) sober from alcohol, and I think he had a pretty good handle on that but it likely caused him to let his guard down for other stuff. I regret not noticing what was going on. Once I noticed that there was money missing, I immediately kicked him out of my parents' house and got him to go to a treatment center. 

I was alone with 2 babies. I didn't tell my parents right away, which I also regret. He ended up out of treatment, passing a home drug test and coming back. Not the best way to handle it on my part, I know. I knew this at the time, but shit, I had a newborn, I was breastfeeding, chasing a two year old, and discovering all these new health issues (I've never had any health issues prior) and going for test after test seeing specialists, etc. I was the definition of vulnerable. 

Shortly after, my parents started to notice things missing. He stole some cash, an air compressor, and a bucket of change from my brother. None of this amounted to too much, not that it makes any difference as far as the betrayal factor. He did the worst damage to me. Racked up my home Depot card, sold my brand new water heater (which I had to go to a shady pawn store and cry to the guy to sell it back to me for $100), took some pills im prescribed, etc. not to mention stopped contributing financially to the home we bought together which was dependent on his income to be able to afford, although thankfully everything is just in my name.

This is not the man I married. The man I married has given up everything for me. The man I married always kept very little money for himself and either bought things for us or just handed it over to me. the man I married would likely kill somebody if they did anything like this to me. But, he did it. All of it. Drugs didn't steal from me, he did. 

As a result of this, my mother has been unendingly nasty to me. She yells at me about everything I do, she talks horribly about my husband, she's nasty to me any time she thinks I talk to him or see him. For like 4 months, almost every night I would take the kids out to eat or to visit friends, stay out until nearly bedtime and go in the house so we could just go up and go to bed so I didn't have to see her. The lack of contribution on his part has also slow down the house renovations, making it even harder to get out of my parents house. She has never been an exceptionally warm mother, and as a person she's pretty toxic and very judgmental (even though she's an alcoholic, she starts drinking around 5pm every night and gets almost legless 4-5 times a week). She has never really worked much and doesn't do a whole lot in general. Right now though, she's watching my daughter while I work. She's very good to my kids. And my dad is always supportive of me, and always has been. I can't afford to pay for daycare for 2 right now. 

My husband is living at his mother's house right now. Since last winter he has been to treatment 3 times and jail once as a result of a drug charge. He doesn't even seem to have a drug of choice, he'll do pretty much anything, except I know he hasn't used intravenously. He says he wants to be clean, and he's been pretty honest with me about what's going on. He never tells me the truth right away, but eventually feels bad about lying and comes clean, though most of the time I know the truth anyway.

The truth is I feel like he can lick this. I think if he was to develop the same resolve for drugs as he had with alcohol he can be the man I married again. And I'd be lying if I said that's not what I want. I would love to be able to see him stay clean and move on from this and be a husband to me and a father to my children. my parents are pushing for divorce obviously but I've made it clear to them that it's not their business and they haven't really said much to me directly, even though they (meaning my mom) toss little hints around. 

As of right now, I'm working full-time living in a beach cottage that my parents own that they're kind of starting to push me out of, I'm taking care of everything for the kids: getting them where they need to go, taking care of everything financially, and of course I have them all the time when I'm not at work. I pay all the house bills and even his truck payment right now so he can continue to work. In the last 5 weeks or so he's given me $1,000. But work was sold for a while for him and now it's starting to pick up. The business is gone and while he was going through all of this his brother, who was working for him at the time, pretty much stole the business from under him and did nothing with it. on a side note he's one of our tenants and when the process of evicting him because he's turned into a total nightmare of a person leaving trash everywhere has a girlfriend that's a weirdo drug addict that bothers all the other tenants..... This lifestyle just isn't me. I have a decent job, I work hard, I'm really pretty good to people. All my friends are similar people. I drink on occasion and have had my party days, but I always was responsible and had jobs and was a full-time student until I started my career.

But my husband has been more present lately. he is super active in the recovery community not only because it's required what he's doing extra stuff on top of whay his probation requires. He's been honest about his slip-ups. I still talk to him regularly and see him with the kids pretty often, at least every other weekend if not more. 

I know once I move into the house with the kids he's going to want to join me, which I'm not going to allow at first. He needs to prove himself and contribute financially quite a bit before I'll even consider letting him move in there with us. Not to mention obviously prove to me on a regular and consistent basis that he's clean. I'm not going to allow my kids to live in any type of toxic environment anymore. Also, I gain literally nothing from divorcing this man. With the business dissolved he has no income and all of the assets are in my name. The only one that stands to gain anything is him.

even though I'm still trying to work this out for myself and for my kids and decide what is best for our family, I know I'm going to get resistance from my family. It's easy to say forget about them and do what's best for me, but they really have been pretty good to me as far as supporting me and the kids with a place to live while this is all going on. 

I guess my reason for writing this post is for validation that this is, in fact, a lot for one person. I haven't really put my business out there to anybody, so most people that know me think that my stress is coming from just regular mom stuff. But I don't get stressed out easily. Also to see if anybody has gone through anything similar and come out on the other side okay because there are days where I feel like it's not going to be okay for me and the kids no matter what I choose to do. And trust me, I'm sure I need to see a therapist but I've tried that. My babysitting resources pretty much get used up when I work and have to run errands for the properties.",3
BF doesn't want to get married (in the future) do we break up?,2,dkuazr,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dkuazr/bf_doesnt_want_to_get_married_in_the_future_do_we/,58,1571655877.0,"I'll try to provide as much info as needed but feel free to ask.


We've been together for about 3 years.

We have some differences in opinions. Some of our bugger fights are:

We've argued about who should pay or not 

We've argued about him justifying the personality of a shitty friend 

We've argued about our emotional communications (honestly thought about breaking up then) this is the main arguement that we have. It's usually me getting annoyed and him not wanting to deal with me.


But through and through, we came back together very strong and happy. I love him with all my heart, and despite these arguements, it never changes how much I love him. So ofc. I imagine that we would eventually get married (not now but maybe once I finish graduate school and find a good career.) I should also note that I met his parents and he met mine and we are very close.


Last Friday I've asked him if he ever consider us getting married. And he said ""to be honest. I am not considering it at all""

Now it's hard cuz he isn't here for me to ask him to repeat and my memory is a bit bias. But at the time when I asked him to clarify, he said something in the lines of ""I don't want to think about it/I don't want to add another stress and think about that. I just want to focus on us now""

Which I kind of get. I'm nowhere near my goals yet. And I 100% want to complete them before I get married. We shouldn't really be considering marriage atm

I see it in his point.


But it makes me feel so sad and stupid and selfish to think that I was alone in these feelings.


Idk I'm not going to ACTUALLY break up. Sorry for the misleading title. But I want to know your opinions on like 

Should I talk to him about this again?

Should I actually feel bad? 

Is he crazy? Am I crazy?


My current plan is to complete my master's, then once I get a job I'll ask him again (this may take about 2 years if accordance to plans)",2
I feel like I’m just never going to “figure it out”,5,dkri0n,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dkri0n/i_feel_like_im_just_never_going_to_figure_it_out/,5,1571641738.0,"Hi everyone, 

I’m 24. I have a BA in psychology in the US, I graduated school two years ago. 

My first “real” job was in a drug and alcohol rehab. As time went on, I hated the place and how dysfunctional it was. There was also drugs being used everywhere where management turned their heads to and a whole lot of insurance fraud. To top it off, I fell while at work and needed two (possibly a third) wrist surgeries. I resigned last January. I returned back to the restaurant I worked in throughout high school and college. 

In July, I was FINALLY okay’d by my doctor to get back to normal and do what I’d like. I accepted a job with the county government in the public defenders office. Things were great until mid September when my boss got a promotion and turned it into a huge power trip. I was getting bitched at almost everyday for things I “wasn’t doing right” and she refused to train me on. She was doing performance reviews months early. It was a horrible work environment. She eventually pulled me in and said either quit right now on your probation period, or I’m firing you. On probation, there is no such thing as a grievance. Needless to say, I resigned on the spot in order to not be black listed from applying within the county government in the future.  Once again, I returned to the restaurant I was working in through high school/college. 

I’m having some health issues that I really need to sort out before applying anywhere again, I also really just need to “figure things out” for myself as to what my next steps are. 

I’ve been back there for a week. Today, I was approached by an older coworker in her 40s and she goes “I feel like you’re going to be a lifer here, why are you back?” This comment really rubbed me the wrong way and I also feel a bit defeated by it. 

I’m 24. I have no idea wtf I’m doing or what I’m doing next. Is more school the right answer? I don’t really know what is. 

Does anyone else have similar experiences? My last two “real” jobs were duds. I really kind of dread the job hunt again.",5

I think he's making a decision based on fear, but I also know enough (and value myself enough) to not beg. I will talk to him when I can, but it's so out of the blue. We were on holiday together a month ago, and it was wonderful.

My friend invited me to a party and she introduced me to a guy friend of hers. The details of the party aren't that important (and I can barely remember them anymore). Long story short, we ended up in a bedroom alone together. We were making out and fooling around, but eventually he made it clear he wanted to do more. I asked him if he had a condom and he said ""no, but I can pull out."" Honestly, I wasn't too comfortable with that, but there was a voice in my head saying ""don't screw this up, just forget about it."" So, I went along with it and eventually we ended up having sex doggystyle.

At first I was enjoying it. Then, I'm not exactly sure why (maybe it was because I was sobering up, or getting sore), but I suddenly started to get worried about him cumming inside of me. At first I thought I would wait a bit until we changed positions, or I had some other opportunity to stop things. I didn't want to be awkward about it and ruin things, but in my head it was all I could think about. I couldn't even focus on the sex anymore. The worry in me kept building and building as I tried to look around the room for something to focus on just to get my mind off of it.

After a while I realized that no perfect opportunity would come, so I told him ""Wait, stop, let's get a condom, I don't want you to cum inside me."" Suddenly, he yelled something weird (I think it was ""fuck, I'm gonna bust!"" but I'm not sure) and I could feel him cumming inside me. I was horrified. I felt a rush of adrenaline echo through my body. I reached behind to push him away from me, but he actually pressed his weight against me and pinned me down until he was finished. Eventually, I felt some of it running down my leg and felt like I was going to vomit. My face was pressed down into the sheets and I could barely breath.

After what felt like forever, he took his weight off of me, and rolled off of me. I didn't freak out on him, instead I just acted cold because I guess I was in shock. He was saying stuff like ""hey, let's go back to the party."" After a while he started to ask ""what's wrong?""

I told him what he did was not OK. He tried to make it sound like an accident. He said that he was really into ""don't cum inside me"" porn, and when I told him to stop it had turned him on and triggered his orgasm. And when I asked him about pinning me down he said it was ""an instinctual thing for guys to do"" and ""he couldn't help it, because it felt so good."" He told me if I really didn't want to get pregnant I could take a morning after pill. But I wasn't really even worried about that, anymore. I was more in shock of being violated, if that makes sense? And I felt like he was saying it was my fault. Like - the fact that I told him to stop is what made him cum, so it's my fault? I'm not sure if that makes sense.

After we got back to the party, I took my friend aside and tried to tell her a bit of what happened. I didn't want to tell her too many details, just that something bad happened and I want to go. It seemed like she didn't really understand me and was saying stuff like ""Really? But X is such a nice guy."" After a while I just went home and sat in the shower.

Today I texted my friend more about what happened and she is saying it's not rape because it happened too quickly. I'm not sure if she's right so I'm trying to get more input on this. This whole thing is so weird and I can't believe this guy would do this. I feel gross now that I even wanted to have sex with him to begin with.",1

What's with the choking?,3,dknsli,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dknsli/whats_with_the_choking/,21,1571625852.0,"Throwaway because it's a little embarrassing to feel so out of the loop.  I'm 31F and was in a long-term relationship through 22-28ish.  It didn't work out, and I've been back in the dating game for almost two years.  I've personally not been a fan of very casual sex (prefer to get to know someone and feel like there's at least potential for a more serious relationship before sleeping together) so have been with 4 guys since the big breakup, one of which was a guy who I'd known for years.   I provide the body-count just for the context that we weren't approaching these as just one fun night / in theory there was a deeper emotional connection.

When we have gotten intimate, all four have gone for my throat as if it's a normal/sexy way to hold me.  The first left me with bruising around my neck/collarbone because I was so surprised by the move I didn't immediately say no.   One gave the raised eyebrow of, ""is this okay"" as he started and immediately backed off when I shook my head, but the rest (including long-term friend) acted like it was as normal or expected as, say, gripping my shoulders or arms.

I can't remember any guy I dated in my early twenties doing this, and I can't remember talking with friends about choking back then like it was normal either.

Have things changed?  Is it something that is considered widely liked and normal now, or is my 4/4 just a coincidence?  Is it a common theme in porn that they think we'll like?  It's not a power dynamic that I find attractive, and seems way too easy to do some accidental choking that can cause serious damage.  Am I an out of the loop curmudgeon?  Is this something I should expect to be treated as normal or expected unless I proactively say otherwise?

I have a pretty weird, funny story from my experience last night. 

So I live in the Netherlands, but I’m American. 

Last night I was out with some friends and we were having a good time. (Both of them are Dutch.) 

We’re sitting on this bench, all of us going through the worst trip we’ve ever had from some incredibly shitty weed. (Who trips over weed in the first place?) everyone’s body is twitching and going completely numb. No one can barely talk. It was really, really bad. 

These two guys come over to us and just stand there, trying to get our attention. Instantly it was off putting. I don’t mind having conversations with strangers and getting to know people, but this felt off. So we’re just kind of ignoring them, and they move closer kind of cornering us. They’re standing and we’re sitting. 

After about two minutes they’re still standing there not taking the hint and we’re too fucked up to really go anywhere else. 

I finally turn to speak to these guys and hopefully get the point across that we don’t want any company right now. This goes back and forth, I just say we’re visiting and that tomorrow we leave. He kept insisting we needed someone to show us Amsterdam. All the while the other guy isn’t speaking to us, just whispering in the other guys ear and staring. 

I say “no” and “no thank you” repeatedly to his requests. Still not moving so I just ignore him. Finally he makes some weird comment about me being racist because I’m American. I don’t say anything to him, I just tell my friends we need to go now. So I get up to leave and this guy shouts “see I knew you were racist.” 

We just kept walking (as best as we could being completely fucked up.)

TL/DR: my boyfriends sisters fiancé assaulted me whilst I pretended to be asleep to avoid awkward conversations. What do I do?

So I have a boyfriend who I love and adore with all my heart and I’m super close with his family and his 3 sisters are my closest friends.
One of the sisters has a fiancé who I kinda looked up to like a brother because we have similar interests and I thought he was super cool.
One night me and my boyfriend were drinking on a night out and my boyfriend ended up getting wasted so I took him back to his place, helped him whilst he was vomiting and put him to bed. I was worried and couldn’t sleep so I spent most of the night downstairs so he could have the bed to himself. At one point his sisters fiancé (let’s just call him Joe because it’s easier to use a fake name) came down and asked me if I was alright, I explained to him I was worried and couldn’t sleep so he took me into the living room and sat on the sofa with me and gave me a hug which is a totally normal thing, I love hugging people there’s nothing weird about it to me it’s platonic as hell. He continued to hug me and stroke my arm and whisper that I should get to sleep and I felt super awkward so I pretended to fall asleep. Whilst I was pretending to sleep he kissed the top of my head and I was trying my best not to panic. Then I felt him pull my vest top forwards (I was wearing a strappy vest top with no bra because I was in comfy pyjamas) multiple times like he was looking at my breasts so I pretended to wake up and he quickly acted like nothing was happening. I should’ve gone upstairs at that moment but I was super tired and still pretty drunk so I was like “oh he won’t do it again now” and pretended to fall asleep again. This time he did the same thing again but actually started to grope my breasts. I pretended to wake up again and I felt fucking awful, I felt dirty. I told him I wanted to lay down somewhere and that he should go back to bed.
Since then I’ve attended multiple of my boyfriends family parties and Joe has always been there and I have to pretend like nothing has happened and chat to him like it’s all fine. It’s tearing me apart and I don’t know what I will do at joes wedding because I know I’ll be invited. I suffer with depression and anxiety and my therapist did nothing but make me feel guilty for not telling my boyfriends sister. What do I do?",29

We played Catan. I'm wearing a sweatshirt and jeans. It was not a wild night. Called an Uber at 9:15 to head home and make some snacks.  

My uber driver gave me a gentle lecture about how unsafe it is to put my actual address in the app, how I should always be dropped off at least a block away from home and walk, and how he was giving that advice based on stories he'd heard from prior female passengers that had regretted letting their drivers know where they lived.

I appreciate that he meant well, but I just hate it so much. I just want to be able to live my life and play a board game with my friends without having to worry about being raped. I'm just so exhausted by the constant paranoid vigilance that we need to keep up. If we do, we're  unfair to men, but if we don't, we're asking for it. We can't win.

Edit: He didn't creep me out, I think he was legitimately trying to be helpful.  It's just exhausting to constantly be reminded that I'm in danger simply by existing as a woman in public.

Edit: to everyone who doesn't get it, I'll copy and paste from a comment I made in this thread. 

Imagine going to a resturant and spending the entire meal with the waitress standing over your shoulder and lecturing you to be careful with your knife because you could cut yourself,  and do you really need that much butter, because it isn't good for your cholesterol? Would you be grateful for the reminders to keep yourself safe, or would you be annoyed that you were unable to relax and enjoy your meal without the constant ""helpful advice""?

I have anxiety and depression but not to this extreme level so I cannot relate to what is going on

My SO and I got recently married in the summer. We were a match in heaven. It was going great when we moved into our own place across the street from his family until recently. 

It’s gotten from this amazing time to down right awful. He started to jump job to job for various reasoning : 

- his boss was mean to him (only lasted a week there) 
- wasn’t enough pay (was a gig app job)
- hated the work (lasted a couple months) 
- his most recent was training and turnover rate was over 110% and that if he quit at anytime he owned $$
Back. It was a contract job and he quit. 

I was out of work for half a year last year after moving due to the company I worked for started to sank and I wasn’t getting interviews until I finally found a place. I knew I didn’t want to stick long to this company as I wanted to save up for college once again. Then the bad news struck : he had a lot of CC debt and my plans for going to college will be haulted for almost a couple to ten years. I was devastated. He thinks if I pay rent and groceries he can use his money to pay off the debt. He has another job lined up that he will start right away but it’s not much salary. Maybe just a bit more than mine. But I have a bad feeling he will not stick to it. I started to cry today and he told me to stop crying. It didn’t help as I had dreams of someday owning a house, kids, just living a nice, sustainable life. He said he can’t afford to have these dreams with me. it was just a low blow.  He told me if my company goes bad just get another job. He dosent understand I want to go to college to better myself but he dosent believe in college and thinks all the jobs will treat me the same and so on and so forth.  He just dosent want more debt right now and I understand but he knew I had been wanting to do this for a very long time.

Making matters worse, his anxiety is
Crippling me to the max. He’s anxiety has gotten to the point where I feel he needs help but he and
His family blow me off. He has the worst social anxiety I have ever seen : not wanting to go to stores alone, avoiding our renters and his family and mine, etc. he has even blown off meeting my friends.

Conflicted - Should I break it off?,1,dksllm,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dksllm/conflicted_should_i_break_it_off/,7,1571647125.0,"Throwaway account for reasons.

Quick background.  I'm a 33m who is recently back in the dating scene after being in a 10 year relationship (7 years of marriage) and going through a divorce.  I've only been in a few relationships and they have always been pretty long since highschool (3-4 years on average).  Anyway to the story.

I recently started seeing a very spunky and smart 25f and things have been very good.  We work in similar industries and have ALOT to talk about all the time. The sex is amazing, however it's mostly been at my house due to the fact she recently moved into a new apartment.  This weekend I helped her get her apartment setup, clean boxes garbage from packed stuff, set up wifi, etc.  As things sometimes happen, we started to get into the heat of things.  She has always talked about how much porn she watches and it kind of turns me on.  However, she turned on her tv and cast her phone with her porn to it and I started to become horrified at the searches.  99 % of them were of girls being taken advantage of by guys while they were sleeping and/or drugged.

&#x200B;

The specific one she brought up was a guy dropping ""something"" into a girls drink while she wasn't looking, and her passing out and then he took advantage of her.  Now obviously, this is porn and highly scripted stuff (i hope), but i still can't help but feel dirty about the situation.  I tried to basically tune it out and keep my mind elsewhere, but afterwords I am so filled with regret that I did not say something about how uncomfortable I was.  We did have a brief chat about it about an hour later when it was brought back up, but I just told her basically i don't understand it and little more was said.  I get it's ""her fetish"", but I can't help but feel like in the same situation, a guy that would be into this type of porn is basically just a rapist in waiting.  She's even expressed to me that she would love for me to do something like this to her while she's asleep, but the thought of it totally repulses me.

I really REALLY like this girl as we click on so many levels, the sex has been great (mostly at my house until today), but I feel like her views on on certain aspects of sexuality are....very misogynistic.... and today was the peak of that feeling.  To make matters worse, a post titled ""3 hours ago I was raped"" (Which has since been deleted) described a woman being violated in this exact way while she was asleep/sobering up.

I don't know what to do right now.  I'm contemplating breaking it off.  As she is pretty strong willed, I feel like a conversation about how uncomfotable it made feel is going to be lost on deaf ears as she's probably just going to tell me to either deal with it or move on, think im not ""enough of a man to take what I want/desire"".  Or maybe it's in my head and she'll be understanding.  I just need some advice guys....",1

Can you feel when a man cums inside a condom? (Possible condom leak),2,dkr8kx,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dkr8kx/can_you_feel_when_a_man_cums_inside_a_condom/,4,1571640503.0,"Hi TwoX! 

I’m sure this sub must be over these pregnancy scare-related questions, but my paranoia is too strong not to try post this. 

My question is, can you feel when a man cums inside you whilst wearing a condom?

The reason for my question: My boyfriend and I had sex last night with a condom. He normally pulls out just before he cums, but last night he didn’t (I’ve never asked him to do this, he does it for his own peace of mind). However, last night, when he came, I suddenly felt warmth inside of me. I freaked out a little but thought maybe it’s just the condom filling up. When I went to pee after sex (as I’ve learnt from this sub), I saw a little bit of white liquid in the little area between my vagina and ass (I’m sorry for the language, I don’t know how else to describe it). I brushed it off as my own arousal. However, this morning I woke up and thinking about it again kind of freaked me out. We were away for the night and by the time we had driven back to the city we live in, all the pharmacies were closed so I couldn’t by an emergency contraceptive. I have work tomorrow but will try get to the pharmacy at lunch time. This means I would have taken the pill more than 24 hours after the event (I’d say 36-40 hours after). I cannot go earlier as they only open after I start work. At the time, I didn’t think to tell him to check for a leak. When I asked him this morning, he said he didn’t see anything but he also didn’t explicitly check for any leaks or breaks. 

I am also not currently on BC, as my neurologist took me off it due to extreme migraines I was suffering. I am allowed to return to using BC from November. My last period started on 7 October, with estimated ovulation to be this coming Tuesday. My cycles range from 29-33 days, depending on work stress. However, I did notice that egg white-like discharge on Friday. Is it possible I ovulated earlier than expected? Also, I’ve heard that emergency contraception isn’t effective if you’ve already ovulated- is this true?

I’m sorry for all the questions above and the rambling of my post. My paranoia has taken over my brain and is preventing me from ordering my thoughts clearly. If you have any advice/insight/etc and post it below, thank you so much for sharing! If this post is too confusing, please let me know and I will try clear it up as much as possible and as soon as possible :)

She first told me about a year ago, and she never shared many details about what happened but what she did say shocked me and I've tried my best to support her as best I can. I adore her and she is the strongest person I know for a variety of reasons.

She told me last week that she had gone to see a counsellor in one of the IAPT services for general anxiety and from the assessment she's been told it's highly likely she's got PTSD from what happened. She's in a state of shock from this, it's been a while and she hasn't had any effects similar to what people usually understand as PTSD. But she has still had this diagnosis.

I'm at a total loss of how to support her. I don't know what I can do. I know I can't fix it and she knows I'm here for her always. I'm encourging her to keep going to therapy.

Personally, I'm angry. The guy that assaulted her is still out there. I'm not going to put it on her but I can't shake this feeling of anger towards him and I have no idea who he even is. I'm scared for her as well, I'm also proud of her. It took so much for her to tell me and tell a complete stranger as well.

Infertility fear,0,dknygb,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dknygb/infertility_fear/,5,1571626519.0,"I (F24) have been with my boyfriend for 7 years. He's my first boyfriend & sexual partner. I've been sexually active for 7 years and have a history of irregular periods. When I was 14 I went to an adolescent gyn specialist who was never able to diagnose me with anything and since then I've never had a diagnosis for the unusual cycles. I'll skip months or have a period for an entire month. I got my first pap smear (late, I know) in Jan of this year and had spotting every day for 3 months straight following it. The screening was normal, and me nor my bf has had an STD (to my knowledge, my bf had 3 sexual partners prior to me). I saw 3 obgyns following my pap smear and bleeding. None could pinpoint a reason and all wanted to put me on birth control. 

I was on so many different kinds of birth control pills from 15-18 y.o. to help my irregularity and severity of my periods and NONE worked. The side effects were awful so I refuse to use it again. 

After that 3 month irregular period at the beginning of the year, things began to straighten out and my periods are relatively normal now. 

My boyfriend and I dont use condoms and he pulls out only around half the time (we have sex a couple times a week). It might sound irresponsible, but we're not scared of getting pregnant and are in a position where it would be fine if we did-- but we aren't trying to. 

This being said, I'm worried about being infertile because if I was going to get pregnant, I would think that it would've happened by now. I haven't brought it up to my dr because I dont want to be judged for being ""reckless"" if I'm not trying to get pregnant. (I dont know if this is an accurate fear). From what I've heard, fertility testing is only performed if you've been trying to get pregnant for at least a year. This is just what I've heard from a friend who did it. So, at this point I would like to know, but am also scared of being told I'm infertile. Not sure where to go from here.

TLDR: have a history of irregular periods, no diagnosis. Bf and I have been having sex for 7 years, with no BC for the last 3 or so and I have not gotten pregnant. Worried I'm infertile.",0

My husband has heard that some women have mood swings which are regulated by the pill, but I thought that was mainly the oestrogen and wouldn't be affected by progesterone only. I'm toying with the idea of going back on the pill to see how that affects me, but then I'd be back to square one.

When we met, him and his wife were having issues as well as myself and my husband. I was on a path towards divorce before I ever met him. 

Shortly after my divorce and his ""separation"", we started seeing each other more often. I was told over and over again that he and his wife had separated and they were just waiting til his oldest son turned 18 to finalize the divorce. 

He had a place picked out and he was moving into it yesterday, signed divorce papers last week... It was time! He constantly talked about how excited he was and he couldnt wait to start this next chapter in his life, how he couldnt wait to marry me one day, we had dinner reservations on Tuesday at a nice place to celebrate. 

Fast forward to yesterday. He came over like normal, we watched  some TV, had lunch. He wasnt feeling well so that was it. I told him to go ahead and go home to lay down before he tried to move anything, so he left. Kissed me goodbye and told me he loved me. Just like normal. 

I went to take a nap and when I woke up I found he had blocked me on everything. I was freaking out because I thought something was wrong since he wasnt feeling well earlier. I couldnt get in touch with him but I could see that he read my message before he blocked me. 

Cue the confusion. This is very out of character, we are constantly talking, texting, there was absolutely no red flags that this was coming. 

Fast forward to last night and I get a text from his WIFE saying our dirty secret is out and him and I are both whores.  WHAT!??? How is this possible? They were finalizing the divorce and he was supposed to move out today! Was he lying to me this whole time? We had a normal relationship, there was no reason to think it wasnt! He put so much time, effort, money, emotion into our relationship. We really worked through some stuff together.

I have a history of terrible pains, random and during inter course. I can remember my freshman year until now (24F) I have these random pains that sometimes can make me drop to the floor, wherever I am and just wait it out. Sometimes it's random, when I'm walking at work, at home or through a store and I get this shooting pain down there, more specifically around my cervix area. When it starts, each step I take it's the worst, or I'll stand still and it comes in waves. One day I was curious to feel exactly where it was because it felt like it was a colon problem, come to find out, the slightest movement to my cervix or touching it (when it happens) I could just shrivel up in a ball. That's just random and I can never really ""make it happen"", so that's always made it hard to explain to Gyns and such. Secondly, sometimes during sex, I'm a freaky person. I tend to like it a little rough sometimes, I find it fun but the very next day, I can almost not have sex. Because of having so much fun the day before, the next day it's so sensitive and sometimes when he hits me in the good spot, it sends a super sharp pain around my groin lymph node areas. I just feel like my whole factory down there has problems at times and it sucks because I do feel like it takes a toll on our sex life. (Together for 6years strong, through thick and thin, he's very understanding and respects me when I'm not in the mood or I just know if I have sex, it's gonna hurt) 
I've never really had my pains diagnosed because it's so hard to explain how, why and when it happens. I have friends who have been diagnosed with endo and agree that what I feel is what that is. But again, Gyns have a hard time pin pointing because of the amount of issues I have. Am I the only one, can someone relate? How do you sooth the pains? I know the difference between period cramps and this, I'd rather deal with the cramps but these are far worse.

"Has anyone noticed any men (typically) who immediately dismiss an assertion or argument you make and kind of ""marvel"" at your ""stupidity"" until they realize you know what you're talking about, they actually don't, and then they get angry/aggressive towards YOU personally as their ego crumbles?",149,dk2u70,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dk2u70/has_anyone_noticed_any_men_typically_who/,120,1571515281.0," I was trying to explain the federal and state judicial system. He was exclaiming that the federal government had jurisdiction over any and all crimes, which is technically true. However, if put into practice would lead to double jeopardy (being charged with the same crime twice by state and federal authorities) and an inefficient criminal justice system/wasted resources and funds. I was trying to explain to him the discretionary criteria that usually dictates if the federal gov will take up a case. Like something involving two states, trafficking, or crimes explicitly written as  powers of the federal government. For example, they alone print money, and therefore would be interested in cases of counterfeit currency. I was saying the federal government does not get involved with any ole crime, it has to be juicy if you will. He proceeded to say ""I can't believe you actually think that"" and that he took a ""com law class so knows"" what he's talking about. Never mind I had two years PRE-L;aw before i enviably changed my major to social work AND I follow court legislation closely at all levels. Which is all BESIDES the point because unlike him I didn't assert I knew everything, that he was mentally impaired, or literally laugh in his face. EVEN though I WAS right. Then he proceeds to become stroppy, snap at me when I bring evidence and sources to his attention, and eventually says ""are you still talking?"" in a cold voice in response to me continuing the conversation with another co-worker who was as interested as me as reaching a conclusion.

YES IM STILL TALKING. YOU STARTED THIS YOU ABSOLUTE ASS HAT. IF YOU CANT STAND THE HEAT GET OUT OF THE MOTHER FUCKING KITCHEN. IM NOT GOING TO CRADLE YOUR EGO LIKE MY OWN NEWBORN CHILD. BEING WRONG DOES NOT WARRANT ATTACKING OTHERS AS YOU TRY DESPERATELY TO SALVAGE YOUR REPUTATION AS THE ""SMART"" GUY. IF YOUR GOING TO ACT LIKE YOU KNOW EVERYTHING, THEN BY GEORGE, KNOW EVERYTHING. IF NOT, PLEASE STAND DOWN, AND LEAVE THE REAL DEATH DEFYING HIGH WIRE ACTS TO THE PROFESSIONALS. STOP PICKING FIGHTS YOU CANT WIN AND THEN BLAMING EVERYONE ELSE FOR THE SPECTACULAR DEFEAT LEVELED AGAINST YOU.

I pride myself on being very informed. I am a social worker so politics and current events are relevant in my life. Social justice is important to me, and respectful debate of issues with others who don't agree with me is something I enjoy. During these conversations, I never make all or nothing statements, assert that I am RIGHT, and they are wrong, that they are unintelligent for thinking what they think, or feign an air of superiority (try my best to at least) over someone else. 

I always know that there is a margin of error, and that just because I believe something to be true, it doesn't mean that some seemingly contradictory ideas aren't valid simultaneously. I am always ready to learn, hear what people have to say, and treat others kindly. I KNOW I do not have a monopoly on truth with a capital T, that everything is nuanced, and black and white thinking doesn't translate into our shades of gray realities. 

SO it has BAFFLED me when people, with little to no evidence to support claims respond with condescending ""oh bless your heart"" for thinking that responses/ I am the superior being attitudes, when they OBVIOUSLY do not know what they are talking about. THEN when they realize they are out of their depth, that become angry, verbally abusive, stoop to name-calling, sulk or withdraw from the conversation entirely, and have a tizzy that they were ""shown up"" by a woman. 

Its like they walk  haphazardly around with their dicks out (English turn of phrase meant to describe someone being belligerently cocky, not a reference to actual male genitalia) and then throw a tantrum when it inevitably gets shut in a door or closed in a drawer. I rarely if ever see women who's blind confidence lends them to this type of minimizing, invalidating, and just plain rude behavior.

I always blamed myself,3,dkjl3y,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dkjl3y/i_always_blamed_myself/,2,1571606806.0,"I am a 26F. I’ve had a few traumas in my life but one that I never talk about because I felt like it was all my fault. Now, 12 years later, I can finally admit that I was pressured. I wish I could say that I feel free of blame but I still feel like it was partly my fault.

I was 14 when this started. I hadn’t done anything sexually with anybody, except making out with my boyfriend (we’ll call him AH). My guy friend (we’ll call him M) was 16. M and I had study hall together and spent a lot of that time in the library. During our time I had a boyfriend and M had a girlfriend.

Things got complicated when I broke up with AH. AH came in to school with a knife and threatened to stab and kill M. I felt like it was my fault.

M and I always flirted (most of the reason AH and I broke up) but nothing more until AH and I broke up. One day in study hall, post break up, M asked me to feel his penis. I told him no but he wouldn’t listen. I was sitting across from him and he grabbed my foot, took my shoe off, and placed my foot in his lap. He rubbed it along himself and when he stopped he told me to keep going. For some reason I did. I didn’t want to but I felt like I had to. I was very insecure about myself and had an eating disorder. M would always tell me how skinny I was and said if I ever got fat that he wouldn’t be my friend. I didn’t want to touch him but I wanted to be loved. I thought he would love me.

It only got worse from there. Every time we were in the library he would make me sit next to him, so I could use my hand instead of my feet, and then he started touching me. Everything was over the clothes. At first I always said no but he’d always grab my hand and make me. If I tried to cross my legs or put my hands in my lap to protect myself he would just push my hands away or push my legs apart. I would always cave and just do what he said. I stopped saying no because I knew it would happen anyway. I started to believe that he had a right to do what he wanted because I let him use my foot before. Who was I to fight now? I also thought maybe he liked me and that’s why he was doing it.

To this day I still don’t know if anybody saw. It seems like people must have, but nobody said anything. Eventually it stopped. He completely shut me out. Instead of feeling happy I felt like I did something wrong and couldn’t figure out why he didn’t want to be friends. I felt used and betrayed.

I feel like at this point in my life I should be able to know if what happened was sexual assault or not but I’m still confused. Looking back I can remember the pressure I felt from him. I remember being scared. At the same time though, I feel like I was so naive and desperate for someone to love me that I let it happen. I knew I didn’t want it but I stopped saying no. I started believing he would love me.",3

So my boyfriend (who I've been seeing about a year now) took things pretty seriously from the first week of just hanging out. We met each other online and hit it off, when i invited him over for the first time he kissed me and i rolled with it, i was really interested in him. His first ""I love you"" was a month in and i let him know i didn't feel that strongly but he started to cry so i told him that we could work towards that stage together. he would always get offended when i didn't tell him i loved him back so to avoid the whole thing i started to say it. i noticed a little while after that that i wasn't feeling him or the relationship at all so i tried to leave him, but he cried again and was visibly really upset so i took him back.

we did the break-up, him crying, then getting back together thing at least 3 times and the third time he started punching the floor and screaming for me to not go. he was also hospitalized for threatening to kill himself when i blocked him on social media and refused to talk to him when he said he was coming to my apartment to talk out a disagreement.

I forgave him because he told me things would be different, and better.

recently we've been having sleepovers and he's been acting like my kid. i ask him to pick something like dirty socks and he does it while dragging his feet. i ask him to repeat something in a clearer way and he gets a fussy attitude about repeating himself. i ask him to not touch me/give me space/that i'm not in the mood for conversation and he acts wounded and sad like it's impossible that i would ever want time away from him. He still has little kid habits like not cleaning up after himself and not speaking clearly, mumbling and playing too much. He doesn't form his own opinions unless i share them with him, he doesn't do anything without my permission, and he apologizes about ''his behavior'' all the time but doesn't change.

I love spending time with him, but he has no chill button. we don't ever have serious conversations that aren't confrontational. we never debate, have calm banter, or an interesting talk. it's either super lovey or super silly and there isn't space for me to be myself.

I don't want to leave him because when he's not with me he acts like a great guy and is interesting af, so maybe he's just gotten too comfortable. advice?",4

In 6th grade we had a teacher that was really cool. We only had good memories of him, and then he quit working at our school after a year or so, because of the school's distance from his home, so we never saw him again.

About one month-few weeks ago, Tara meets him at a gaming con. It was the usual ""good to see you, it's been so long""-kind of convo. He was there with his kids that is just a little bit younger than us.

Last weekend, Tara gets a physical letter from him, that says something like:
 ""It was fun to meet you at the con, and I haven't been able to stop thinking about you. You have grown into a beautiful young woman and I hope to keep contact and meet you sometime"" together with hearts and his email, number and social media. **note that he's 41 years old, we're 17**

She's dead stressed out and her parents decided that they're not going to do anything about it. (They don't even seem to care so much).  I don't think he's going to do any harm, but I feel like something has to be done. I'm trying to convince her to talk to the school therapist because I think it would be good to pay it forward to someone working at school. If that won't work maybe I will talk to the principal. But I feel like a terrible friend to do all these things behind her back (she's a bit passive about this all, just stressing and not doing anything while I'm trying to think of something to do). 

This guy STILL works as a teacher in another school and I really don't want him to do these kinds of creepy flirting to other kids. That's why I think something needs to be done, and that he must realize that it is absolutely not okay...

I've heard from others that Tara should just answer that she's not interested and not make such a big deal out of it all.

I'm a bit confused and stressed about the whole situation and I'm trying to figure out what to do. What do you think?

In desperate need of some female advise,0,dkhvkj,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dkhvkj/in_desperate_need_of_some_female_advise/,13,1571595798.0,"Hey! 

So I dont know if this is the right place to post this, however I am feeling very confused and I need to check myself before I do something I am going to regret. I have been a luker here for a very long time and this seems the best place for some non-judmental advice. So I'm going to give some background and then I'll ask my question. 

I have been with this guy for about 8 months now and it has never been easy. We were toghter for a year when we were teenagers, he was my first love and in my hormone riddled teenage brain I really thought we were in it for the long hall, and then we broke up because there were rumours that he was still sleeping with his ex. When we broke up he then got back with that ex girlfriend and has been with her for the last 10 years. In February this year he got back in touch and we started talking again and everything just fell back into place within seconds. Within that first month we were sleeping together behind his girlfriends back, he was promising he would leave her and we could have a future I just needed to give him time. At the time I was going through my own messy divorce and I didn't have the energy to fight this so I stupidly just kept swallowing all his shit. He says he loves me and that he wants marriage and all that crap. In the end I lost my temper and gave him a deadline, which he ignored, and then another deadline, which he stuck too. He has now left and is living away from his family home but this doesn't make me feel any better, I cant trust him at all. At the moment we arnt together but he texts me every day telling me he is going to fix this and I just dont know what to do.

So here's my questions. 1 - should I forgive him for knowing how much all this hurt me and doing nothing about it? 
2 - my male friends (i dont really have that many female friends and the ones i do are agreeing with the guys) think I need to tell the girlfriend what has been going on. I know that their whole relationship she has been paranoid about him and myself and they are saying it is only fair that I warn her that she isn't crazy and there has been something going on. 

Sorry for the long post I just needed to get all this  out!",0

Should I bring up facial hair to my mother?,5,dkcbar,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dkcbar/should_i_bring_up_facial_hair_to_my_mother/,5,1571560409.0,"My mother is an angel of a woman, and one of the brightest spots in my world. 

Over the past year or so, she has had some health issues, which have included her being on a regimen of hormone blockers, and also she has been experiencing some long-term vision issues. Happily, her health is steadily improving!

She has never taken much of an interest in make up, nor in elaborate or trendy hair and clothing styles, but she has always made a point to dress smartly, if comfortably, and she seems dedicated to looking polished, but has always been very reserved.

What I’m looking for advice on is: she has grown in some very fine, but fairly noticeable facial hair due to the hormone blockers. I doubt that she could feel that they are there, but I also suspect that her vision is weak enough that she can also not see that they are there.  

Next weekend, she is hosting an event with our extended family, whom I know will be wishing to give her lots of loving attention.

So my question: do I mention the facial hair to her, as I risk making her feel self-conscious about it, or make her suspect that I am bothered by it, which I certainly am not. Or does mentioning it to her give her an opportunity to remove it, maybe even for just this one event, as her hormone blocker regiment should not last much longer, because I feel very strongly that if she were able to see you that the facial hair was there, she would have already done so.

I’m trying to put myself in her shoes, but I’m feeling like I am teetering on a delicate edge.

All advice is intensely appreciated!",5

There is one teacher all the women have a creepy story about, that has recently been aggressive with me and other women he works with. He's even done it in front of his students. It's not blatant sexual harassment, he's only commented on my body once, but he only acts this way with young, newer, female employees. He is basically being an (for lack of a better term) attention whore. If he says something to someone, and we ignore him he ups the intensity, and if we ignore that then he turns it up another notch- for instance he stood in my door waving while walking by with his class, and i flat out ignored him. He then yells to his class ""class! Say hi to mrs. Cats_on_t_rexes! This is where she lives!"" And had the whole class wave at me as they walked by my office. I have filed a formal sexual harassment claim with the school, but i doubt more than a slap on the wrist will come out of it. I personally know of 2 other women he has harrassed,  and i told them i filed and encouraged them to do so as well, but they're not ready. I will respect their wishes to remain anonymous. 


Here's what pisses me off most. I consider myself to be bold. I am not afraid to speak up or advocate for myself. I've told many men to go f themselves on plenty of occasions. So many people I've told about whats going on at work ask ""why dont you just tell him to go away?"". I ask myself it all the time as well. There is something inside of me that completely freezes. Deer in headlights, mouth cant move, heart beats rapidly, brain shuts down....it makes me insane. I feel so weak. Why cant i stick up for myself in this situation? More importantly, how do i find the courage to start? I psych myself up for work in the morning while doing my makeup by listening to a power-women playlist i made. I practice self care. I really really hate feeling this way. If anyone has any suggestions on how i can find my voice in this situation, I'm all ears!",0

Lived together, shared bank account, shared car, had a dog together, etc. It was every type of abusive and took just about everything in me to leave the final time. I went to therapy afterwards, and worked through some heavy steps toward rebuilding myself. In the four year span, there was cheating, lies, physical abuse, gaslighting, tons of manipulation, and too many ‘should-have-been-the-final-straw’ moments, one being a notification popping up on his phone, which I’d had for the day because mine was broken and I was awaiting a call from a potential job. 

When I’d tried to open it, it said an extra security password was needed for said content. I figured out that password and that was when all my greatest fears came to surface, everything I’d been manipulated through, insulted for asking about, it was all there. Cheating, pictures, texts, you name it. Like I said previously, there were so many similar times to come, before I finally left, so years have gone by and I had well forgotten about that particular one. 

I’ve been with my current boyfriend for a year, and he knows all about my past with my ex and will offer me reassurance in productive ways if I need it. We have a pretty secure relationship trust-wise, though. Tonight however, it’s past midnight and I’m up online shopping(🤷🏻‍♀️) when his phone buzzes next to me. I glanced over at it and it was the same exact message I’d seen before. There was an extra security password needed to open said notification.

Let me tell you, my heart sank in a way it hadn’t in years. I went into the bathroom and was in a full-fledged panic attack, shaking like crazy, couldn’t catch my breath. I couldn’t even process what I was feeling, it was just ‘that’ feeling all over again. 

J (now-boyfriend) heard me and rushed in and held me, asking what happened. When I told him, all I said was that I’d seen that exact notification before and he put two and two together. He got his phone, opened it up and showed me the entire private folder, even though I told him he didn’t need to. And guess what? It was all pictures of me. The notification was to transfer contacts in that folder or something along those lines. 

He didn’t get defensive, didn’t blame me for not trusting him, knew it wasn’t even about him, really. Just held me and showed me all the contents of the folder. Honestly, I’ve never had any problems trusting him and we’re so open with one another, it seems foolish to even consider him hiding anything purposefully behind my back. 

Anyway that’s my rant. Just reflecting on the emotions and processing now that I’m calmed down and it’s nice to brag about security. Haven’t had too much of it in my life yet.

More awareness needs to be brought about such injustice, people need to pressure their leaders so that countries put more pressure on China to stop these atrocities.

&#x200B;

For the triumph of evil, good people just need to stay silent.

&#x200B;

The article is so much worth reading it for yourself, but here are some of the excerpts that just made my heart sink:

&#x200B;

>Sauytbay estimates that there were about 2,500 inmates in the camp. The  oldest person she met was a woman of 84; the youngest, a boy of 13.  “There were schoolchildren and workers, businessmen and writers, nurses  and doctors, artists and simple peasants who had never been to the  city.”

&#x200B;

>“I will give you an example. There was an old  woman in the camp who had been a shepherd before she was arrested. She  was taken to the camp because she was accused of speaking with someone  from abroad by phone. This was a woman who not only did not have a  phone, she didn’t even know how to use one. On the page of sins the  inmates were forced to fill out, she wrote that the call she had been  accused of making never took place. In response she was immediately  punished. I saw her when she returned. She was covered with blood, she  had no fingernails and her skin was flayed.”  
>  
>On one occasion, Sauytbay  herself was punished. “One night, about 70 new prisoners were brought to  the camp,” she recalls. “One of them was an elderly Kazakh woman who  hadn’t even had time to take her shoes. She spotted me as being Kazakh  and asked for my help. She begged me to get her out of there and she  embraced me. I did not reciprocate her embrace, but I was punished  anyway. I was beaten and deprived of food for two days.”

&#x200B;

>“The inmates would be given pills or injections.  They were told it was to prevent diseases, but the nurses told me  secretly that the pills were dangerous and that I should not take them.”  
>  
>*What happened to those who did take them?*  
>  
>“The pills had different  kinds of effects. Some prisoners were cognitively weakened. Women  stopped getting their period and men became sterile.” (That, at least,  was a widely circulated rumor.)

>The fate of the women in the camp was  particularly harsh, Sauytbay notes: “On an everyday basis the policemen  took the pretty girls with them, and they didn’t come back to the rooms  all night. The police had unlimited power. They could take whoever they  wanted. There were also cases of gang rape. In one of the classes I  taught, one of those victims entered half an hour after the start of the  lesson. The police ordered her to sit down, but she just couldn’t do  it, so they took her to the black room for punishment.”

>Tears stream down Sauytbay’s  face when she tells the grimmest story from her time in the camp. “One  day, the police told us they were going to check to see whether our  reeducation was succeeding, whether we were developing properly. They  took 200 inmates outside, men and women, and told one of the women to  confess her sins. She stood before us and declared that she had been a  bad person, but now that she had learned Chinese she had become a better  person. When she was done speaking, the policemen ordered her to  disrobe and simply raped her one after the other, in front of everyone.  While they were raping her they checked to see how we were reacting.  People who turned their head or closed their eyes, and those who looked  angry or shocked, were taken away and we never saw them again. It was  awful. I will never forget the feeling of helplessness, of not being  able to help her. After that happened, it was hard for me to sleep at  night.”

To lose someone you loved, not the going to the grave type but in some ways yes, I guess.
That seems to be a bit confusing, let me explain, I meant in the sense of losing someone you loved because they stopped loving you or never loved you at all. For me it felt someone died that you deeply loved. You shared all these intimate moments with her, told her aspects of your life that no one knows about, the kind of stories that make a man vulnerable, but you were comfortable being vulnerable with her, or at least someone. You had the courage to reveal your true self, when she left it feels as though she never cared about those moments or who you are. When she finally left, you were always expecting her to leave in the midst and glimmer of joy you felt around her, while you thought how lucky you are in truth you always knew it was inevitable. She is alive, but her heart and mind are not with you anymore. I am no longer part of her life, no late-night conversations or random texts of mundane moments. She doesn’t anymore, she is not part of your life anymore the only way to continue is to continue on as though she has passed from your life, as though she died.
So, you mourn her loss…
However, the culmination of all memories does not disappear like she has, they linger and echo all through the days, weeks, months. Simmering reminder, of your failure to hold her close. Because, she has become your home, the warm blanket on a cold night, the place you rest your thoughts. You lose your home, you become homeless. The place of rest has gone, the blanket that cradled you has gone.
 
So, what are you left with?
Your instinct to keep living is what keeps you going. You look for something to keep your mind distracted, you need to keep yourself occupied every moment of everyday. The worse part of your day is nighttime. The silence becomes deafening and judgmental, and become weak from insomnia. You hear and see but it’s a blur and haze. Days weeks months pass, they say time heals all wounds, they didn’t mention the part for people like me who love intently, that the truth is it does not. It’s a missing limb, but that limb is a person. You gave them a piece of yourself and they took it with them.
 
But, when you love, you love irrevocably without prejudice.
When you love that person, you love them and want them to be happy even if your not in the picture, smiling at all to see the joy you feel together.",0
The migraine that (may have) saved my life,414,djso9h,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/djso9h/the_migraine_that_may_have_saved_my_life/,80,1571456416.0,"TL;DR migraines + NuvaRing = stroke risk

My NuvaRing has been driving me crazy. Depending on the position and shape of my cervix, it likes to scootch it’s little birth control self down to the lip of my vagina and it’s like, hello, I do not need to feel you 24/7. So I made an appointment with my OB’s office to get that sucker checked out. 

I was in the middle of my intake paperwork when I saw the telltale flash in the corner of my left eye. A migraine aura, classic in the way I usually experience it as a string of little triangles in my peripheral vision. So I was blinking funny and squinting when the doctor came into the room. I offhandedly said, “Forgive the weird faces I’m making. I’m sorting through a migraine aura.”

She looked at me pretty seriously and said, “Then we need to get you off that NuvaRing right now.”

Apparently there’s substantial evidence backed up by reputable studies that women who experience migraines with auras - or migraines at all, over the age of 35 - are at a higher risk for strokes. 

So while I shoved my migraine medication in my face and called my husband to talk IUDs vs. condoms, I was thanking God for the timing of this migraine. Contraindications are no joke, friends.",414

Another week goes by and he asked me why I don't bring candy anymore.  About a month later he 'accidentally' brushed into my breast.  This is the second time he has done this, the first time I thought well, maybe it was an accident.  But now I'm sure that it wasn't.  I try to keep furniture between me and him whenever we're in the same room.  I'm very uncomfortable around him. Two weeks after that, he asked me to go out with him for COCKtails.  He enunciated the word cock.  I told him no, I'm not interested and that I have to work.  I was trying to get him to leave.  This week I found out that he implied to a couple of my coworkers that I was incapable and forgetful.  My first thought is he said this because I wouldn't go out with him last week.

I'm not sure if this would turn into an argument if I confronted him first or if would help to diffuse the situation.  Is it foolish to talk to him first?  Or is this best handled by HR?  He's old and nearing retirement.  I'm not trying to get him fired, I just want him to stop.",3

Moreover, I never really had relationships with girls growing up because I was really weirded out by them; they seemed prissy and kinda mean. I will never understand the girl thing of loving horses, which I regard as pre-automobiles.  


That said, I want to write and create believable cis women, and part of that is understanding how little girls grow up, what they go through. And I'll be honest most of my knowledge of that comes from My Little Pony: FIM, Mean Girls and the very lonely life of Lisa Simpson, which when she's not being a Mary Sue, I really relate to.  


I didn't grow up with sisters, and my mom always wanted a daughter, was closest to me and then screamed in horror when I brought that up crying out ""Not you, never you."" It kinda hurt. Also sometimes she REALLY goes into town on me for not acting like a girl, or at least a proper girl. And I can't imagine how this would have shaped me if I have been born cis and this had been hammered into me from day one.  


I do want to ask specific questions about plausibility, but that might be for another thread or another subreddit. But I will ask this: One character I have is Amanda. Pretty, smart, hyperactive, was a chearleader in high school and maybe more athletics. But she was NEVER popular. She was always that weird kid that other kids egged on to eat worms, did it, and could never understand why they didn't like her after that. She was never willing to change herself to fit in and got into a LOT of fights. Mean girl stuff with her would get you punched in the mouth because she didn't really have another way to respond to bullying like that.   


When she was in college she reinvented herself to be (before the term was invented) a basic bitch to get along wth other girls, joined  sorority and got a boyfriend. But the boyfriend was boringly conventional and didn't understand Amanda's depths and he friendships of college turned out to be pretty superficial. The whole time Amanda is nursing a MASSIVE inferiority complex because people took her to be foolish and or stupid. She doesn't really understand what she could do to stop that, but she always tries to direct the conversation that she's actually well read and while eccentric very smart. It didn't help that when she first took the SATs, she scored a 1300 (back when the SATs only had two 800 point sections), and her parents were so upset they grounded her for a month and she eventually got a 1430. Her parents intended this to be a 'we know you're capable of more, so do better' but she took it as 'you are most disappointing to us, flaky and irresponsible, least intelligent daughter.'  


Does that sound remotely realistic for an upper middle class white girl who's pretty but genki? And what could I do to flesh out her social backstory, if only for my own knowledge, to give her depth a realistic character needs?",0

My talented sister did some gorgeous neutral makeup on her and she was stunning, but the sheer amount of steps we had to go over was a lot for her. We also went to Sephora and she was totally overwhelmed with the amount of products and the massive cost of getting started with that quality of makeup.

She became my best friend when they were a couple of months together. They have been together for almost 2 years.

So one night ago I had a sleepover with my female bf. At around 22:00 one of our closest friends called me and said he really was feeling down and if he could stay at my place for the night to be sure he didnt do anything that he could might regret. I say fine, come over since he was feeling bad. This is where it begins. I let my bf choose something out of my closet since she didnt have a pyjam with her. She takes the tightest and shortest short (sort of like gymnastics short) and puts it on. Out of all the long pants and decent shorts she takes that one. She goes into bed waiting for our friend to arrive. When he arrives they immediatly start flirting all around. Couple of hours later we're on the bed and watch some netflix. Note that she is laying beside him, and tells me to lay with them. She made some space by laying more at his side. Leaving me no other choice but to lay against the border of the bed.
After some time I say i go to sleep. They both responded a bit too enthusiastic. Both replies were like 'yeah oke nice'. I couldnt sleep. After some time I hear moaning and the matrass that moves ALOT. Im couldnt see what was happening because I was laying with my back face them. I know for SURE they were having sex. The only thing I regret is that I didnt say anything while they were in the act. I was just like 'wtf is this really happening?'. After some while he taps me on the back saying 'are you awake' in which i replied 'yeah i am now thanks for waking me'. To which he replied 'oh im sorry' but i could hear something of happiness in his voice. 

Now straight forward to when my male best friend is back in town from his boarding school. I call him and say what happened. (I told him myself because i knew she wouldnt tell him, because she cheated on him more than this one time, otherwise I would have confronted her and let her decide if and how she would say it.)  My best friend believed me when I told him and he was very much pissed at my female bf. BUT my female bf is bipolar and very good at manipulating. 
This morning I get a call from my bf saying 'Aren't  you making this all up? Are you sure that they did something? '. At this point I was like wtf why would I lie about something like this.

How do I stop being codependent on my boyfriend?,3,dk50wl,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dk50wl/how_do_i_stop_being_codependent_on_my_boyfriend/,4,1571526815.0,"Ok so, this is taking me a lot to write and admit to myself. I'm 20, my bf is 20 as well. When I was 18-19 I lived away for a school year because the school I wanted to go to was quite far away. I ended up not getting any friends at the school, but still wanted to finish the school year so I stayed. I felt super lonely, and pretty much only talked to my boyfriend (on skype, besides the few times he visited me). And so because that time was super difficult for me, I sort of lost contact with my friends at home too. So fast forward to this summer when I moved back home. I've realized that I've ended up depending on my boyfriend, and I feel like it might ruin things if I can't stop it. If he doesn't respond to a text after maybe 30 minutes, I HAVE to check if he's been on any social media (snapchat, messenger etc) in the time that has passed. I feel like I have to check where he is constantly, just because I'm bored and don't have anyone else. I'm not checking up on him because I'm worried he's cheating or doing something wrong. I'm simply doing it because I've literally become dependent on talking to him every minute of the day. And so now, I'm worried that me being so dependent on him is going to mess things up/cause a conflict. And I can also tell that it's very unhealthy for me, which just sucks. I was never this way before, so I really would like to change back. How do I stop depending on him???

Then a older man sat beside and started “sleeping” while facing me while his hands are on his pockets. The pockets were shaking. I started freaking out. At first I couldn’t believe it so I just continue doing my own thing but then I heard him making noise so I packed my stuff and bolted away from there. I reported it to the librarian but why do I feel like shit? Why do I feel humiliated? I feel humiliated that I have to tell a librarian that I don’t even know. I’m scared that the whole library staff will see me as the “freaking out” girl. I didn’t even do anything but why do I feel upset? A safe place that I like going to is not even safe to me anymore.

I drew this piece called 'Overgrown'. We all have relationships that pull at us...can this tension help us to grow?,108,djnvfy,https://i.redd.it/lhhykb4u1bt31.jpg,3,1571435832.0,,108
"Finally left an abusive relationship after asking the Universe for a cosmic sign, which happened last night.",9737,dj8sik,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dj8sik/finally_left_an_abusive_relationship_after_asking/,612,1571358444.0,"Well, I finally did it. I am leaving my (28F) boyfriend (28M) of two years. I should've done it a few months ago, the first and only time he was ever physically abusive toward me, although he's been emotionally abusive our entire relationship.  Like many in denial, I eventually forgave him and tried my hardest to make things work, as if it were my fault or within my control to change him, because I wanted to fulfill our dream of getting married and having babies.

Recently things have continued to worsen. He recently went on a family trip. I had the house to myself for two days, and it was bliss. While he was gone, I prayed to the Universe or God or whomever was listening for a sign on what to do with our worsening relationship. It felt like a desperate attempt, but I really couldn't decide what to do. When he came home, I realized I was just about ready to end things when I noticed I wasn't excited to see him. He took a nap and then went to the store, returning with ingredients for s'mores. He lit up the little backyard grill while downing a bottle of wine, and invited me outside. As we sat in the rain roasting marshmallows, there was a strange tension in the air, like we both knew the moment should've felt more romantic than it did.

A marshmallow fell off his skewer into the flames, at which point he screamed ""FUCK!!!!"" loud enough for our multiple older neighbors to hear, who we share fences and backyard space with. I tried to hush him, reminding him of our neighbors and that it was *just a marshmallow*. Out of nowhere, he started spewing hateful statements to me and told me I ruined the whole evening. ""Well, I tried."" I said as I started walking back inside the house. As I did, he started aggressively hurling half-eaten s'mores and burnt marshmallows at me, narrowly missing me for the sliding glass door.

And that was it! My moment! My sign! As if the Universe or God couldn't have a more twisted sense of humor, my sign came to me as an aggressively-thrown burnt marshmallow. In his typical fashion after acting abusively, he asked me, ""What, so you're just going to be sad and grumpy and ruin the rest of the night?""

I just looked at him blankly and said, ""No. I'm just going to leave you.""

""Good,"" he said, ""I don't want you anyway.""

So that's that. It's time for me to be brave and face the music. He would only change if he wanted to and felt like he needed to, which he definitely doesn't. Like many women in their late 20's, I'm terrified of being alone, of being vulnerable, of being rejected and hurt. Of dating again. Oof. I'm afraid of waking up one day in my 40's, single and childless when I dream of being a mom, regretting my life choices. But the only fear that surpasses that one is bringing children into this world with the wrong person; of waking up not single and childless, but married with two kids with an abusive spouse and a loveless life. Waking up knowing that I ignored all red flags and warnings from my loved ones, and that it was too late. Now, I know he could change perhaps someday, and nothing is set in stone. But my female gut instincts are telling me that it's not worth putting all of my (literal) eggs in that basket, and once children are involved, the stakes are too high.

I owe it to my future unborn children to find them the best father possible. I owe it to myself to have the relationship and marriage I deserve and desire. I know I'm not perfect and I have issues I need to work on too, but I'm an amazing woman who is loving, capable, loyal, and who will make an excellent mama and wife someday. And if I ever start to regret my decision to leave, I'll remember this: that I deserve better, that he is abusive, and that my future children and I will be better off.

Maybe this helps someone else today, if I'm lucky. Stay strong ladies. Love yourselves and others, never settle, and enjoy Autumn because it's a beautiful season for change.

**TL;DR** \- Asked the Universe for a sign to end my abusive relationship with my boyfriend (as if I should've needed a sign), which conveniently came to me as a burnt marshmallow being thrown at me in an unapologetic display of cosmic humor.

**EDIT 10/17/19 @ 3:47pm** \- So this post positively blew up, and I'm shocked but more so completely in awe of how loving and supportive everyone has been. It literally gives me hope not just for my love life but for the world as a whole, so thank you immensely for commenting and existing. And for those asking if I actually left, yes. I'm signing my lease on my new apartment today. And I have a cat, she's an absolute peach, and we are going to conquer all the scary single stuff together. Oh! and I am also in a safe place and not in any danger - thank you for those with concern for that as well. Sending love to everyone, and a hug to every woman (and man!) that is going through anything similar.

**EDIT #2**: 

\- To everyone saying ""the first 'sign' to leave should've been the physical abuse,"" YES. I completely agree. There are lots of reasons why people stay in abusive relationships (denial, insecurity, promises of change, embedded finances/lives, etc.), and I succumbed to those for too long. Abuse is a tricky subject, even more so when it's not overtly physical as it can be harder to detect. PLEASE if you are in any type of abusive relationship, get the support and help you need to keep yourself safe and to get out. ***Call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1−800−799−7233 or go to*** [***https://www.thehotline.org/***](https://www.thehotline.org/) ***for support and guidance***. 

And yes, I am moved out and safe. Thank you all for your love and concerns <3",9737

Thank you all for your advice and I think I just needed an extra push to realize that my situation was causing a lot of stress in my life. I sent my ex the message below and we will not be talking in the future. 

  

""Been thinking since we last hung out. I wanted to be friends, but I don’t think I’ll be able to move on if i know in the back in my mind you could text me or ask to hang out.

I realized I’m still putting your needs first even though we aren’t together anymore. Even sending this message was hard because I didn’t want to upset you. I think I thought that we would get back together in the future but at this point after everything I genuinely don’t want to. I kind of just want to live my life without feeling guilty for trying to move on because I obviously still care for you but I’m not in love anymore. I wanted to send this message because I don’t believe in ghosting and we can be mature about this.

Things don’t have to be weird if we see each other in public or at the vet school. I’m fine to have a conversation and be friendly because I do enjoy catching up but besides that it would probably just be better for us to do our own thing. We had a good run and not for nothing I still have a lot of fond memories of us. 

If you need to talk to someone the university health counselors have been helping me a lot and I think they are a good resource to take up. Wish you and your family the best, I don’t hold any Ill will for you even though it didn’t work out and I hope you find what you’re looking for.""

I am really concerned about this second lump I have found yesterday morning. My first lump was a fibroadenoma on my left breast near my armpit that I surgically removed in 2015.. This new lump is much harder and rounder but deeper in the skin/tissue (?) I have to press down to feel it. It's also right next to my nipple. I contacted my OBGYN, Primary doctor and hospital but no one can see me until January (big monopoly hospital in NY doesn't care what you're going through) I have no insurance costs left for out of network OBGYN's.

I was sexually assaulted at 14 years old and I just realized it today.,3,djxeho,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/djxeho/i_was_sexually_assaulted_at_14_years_old_and_i/,11,1571478720.0,"I'm a woman, 27 yo. I had this friend (14M back then) in high school, who I kinda liked. He had a girlfriend back then (still with her). But I still had a minor crush on him. I trusted him. He was a good guy in my book. So we're at my house, chitchatting, and we go to my room, because my computer is there. He ends up kissing me, touching me, and I just sit there, saying nothing. He keeps touching me down there and I can't say a thing. 

[I must say my only experience with men at 14 was pecks, hugs and sleeping next to the guy in the grass once, which I thought was pretty wild for my age. Never had sex until 17.]

So he just puts his finger in my vagina, going back and forth. My stomach feels weird. I finally laugh nervously, push him softly and tell him he has a gf. He doesn't care, he says. So he just stands up, says he has to go and he'll see me at school. I almost completely forget about it until a few years ago. I don't feel shocked by this, but it still gives me a weird taste in my mouth.

Fast forward to today... I don't see him anymore, thankfully. Today, I got that discussion with my bf and he just said something to me like, ""you realize that idiot assaulted you?"" 

My boyfriend is right. That teenager sexually assaulted me. 

Oh and the worst thing in the story. Years later (22, 23 years old maybe) I hear he told many friends of his he slept with me once, which did not happen. Men can be such losers...

It's so annoying when stereotypes you thought you left behind catch up on you,7,djum0z,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/djum0z/its_so_annoying_when_stereotypes_you_thought_you/,4,1571465012.0,"I (f, 28) am a pretty open minded person and consider myself that kind of feminist who not only questions female but also male stereotypes and I am very aware of how men suffer from toxic masculinity.
But here I go again, realizing that my learned stereotypes haven't really gone away yet and I am now kind of beating me up for it.
Long story short: my husband doesn't want sex today, he even has good reasons to not want to and we still cuddled a lot so we do have our intimacy, but still I feel/felt awful about the rejection. Usually I am that kind of person who constantly tells women that they do not owe sex to anyone and that they do not have to fake a headache or whatever, no means no, the reason and relationship status does not matter and a trustworthy partner respects that. So here I am, nevertheless struggling with his rejection even though men should have the absolute same right to say no for whatever reason they want to, but still the image of the everhorny male is so implanted in my brain. The image society draws of men is that they are always willing and needing to fuck and that women are always the ones who are the limiting factor in how often a couple has sex. Let's not talk about the absurd heteronormativity of these images, even that aside, how fucked up is this view? Here we go instead of just having a cuddly evening he feels bad about rejecting me, knowing that it is kind of expected from a man to never let an opportunity for sex pass and here I am feeling that something is wrong with me for not being wanted.

This is so so stupid and at least I can see that and not be deeply upset but I am still not advanced enough in fighting those stereotypes that it doesn't matter at all to me when it shouldn't. Instead I should be happy to be in a relationship where he can talk about his feelings without being afraid I'd question his masculinity.

This rant just needed to go somewhere. Shout out to all the boys and men fighting toxic masculinity and to all the women embracing that life isn't about what ""real men"" or ""real women"" do but about being your true and honest self.",7

Being told 6 times in a row as the general comment on my well-being  that I look tired and stressed out eventually sank in and now I'm tired, stressed, And insecure about my ability to actually look good as a manager, while trying to get the job done. The job is getting done, but there's a constant stream of things that need dealt with, and ordered, and shipped, and it's hard to keep all the balls in the air. 

It's not all negative though. There are also people who have encouraged me in this new job and they are wonderful, but a request to the others, if it isn't kind or empowering don't say it. The effects stack.

Long story short: if you comment on someone's appearance, please make it a valuable, helpful, and worthwhile use of your words.

Thank you for listening to my rant. The next few weeks are going to be hectic as I settle into my job.  if you would like to comment, I would especially appreciate your tips for success with multitasking, tips for getting the job done when there are more than 3 rings in your circus, or tips for having a good public image for your coworkers while doing a new complicated thing.",0
I got another UTI! Can I ask my doctor for my urine lab results from a month ago without paying for a visit? + What are your experiences with online doctors?,1,dk0hxk,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dk0hxk/i_got_another_uti_can_i_ask_my_doctor_for_my/,7,1571498889.0,"Hello! I had a UTI like a month ago. I'm very frustrated because I'm pretty sure I have another one now! I lost my insurance so I won't be able to afford going to the doctor. Ugh.

Anyways, last time I went to the doctor for it, they prescribed me antibiotics. They didn't have my urine results yet as I needed to try treatment immediately and the test was taken the same day (obviously.) My UTI ended up clearing up and I stopped feeling symptoms. My doctor never told me my urine results, though. 

Now that I suspect I have another UTI, I wonder what my results were last month. Can I call my doctor to know for free, or will they force me to come in and charge me? Side note: do any of you have experience getting prescribed antibiotics online? I hear it's cheaper than paying out of pocket at an office. Thanks in advance!",1
I reconnected with my abusive ex last week. It went really well! But today he blocked me. Could use some support.,0,dk0c47,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dk0c47/i_reconnected_with_my_abusive_ex_last_week_it/,7,1571497658.0,"I just want to share this and maybe get some support. Not looking for relationship advice or anything. Just an abused gf needing some support from her fellow girls. 

I'll skip the details of the abuse. 1 year and 8 months. He broke up with me early August to have a child with the woman he was cheating on me with (and on her with me). Obviously extremely painful, even though I'd known about her for a long time. 

He told me we could still be friends but then emailed me that we couldn't, about a week later. Fully ghosted me. I was stuck in this shitty situation where I didn't have closure and also really concerned about his relationship with current girl. I cried literally every day about it for 2 months, did nothing else.

Last week, two months after the breakup, we reconnected and I told him I NEEDED to speak to him. We had a video chat the next day. I told him I had nothing but love and support for him, but he'd really left me in an awful place.

He was extremely receptive. We both cried for 2 straight hours. He apologized and I thanked him and it was honestly very healing. We both acknowledged that we still loved each other in a friendly way and wanted the other person to be happy, and missed each other. He said that we would talk again in probably a week, and agreed to read a letter I'd send him to his therapist. He said that he wouldn't be extremely communicative but would not ghost me. This was absolutely fine with me. I didn't want to reconnect, and was very clear about this. I just wanted closure.

I felt so much relief. I didn't know what would make things ""better"", but just telling him all this stuff and having him apologize was so important. I really did feel energized for the first time in months. I felt like I could get through this, like a weight had been lifted. 

Just today he sent me an email that we couldn't stay in contact at all, due to not having the emotional resources and wanting to stay in good standing with the girl he left me for. He blocked me everywhere. 

[Removing his reasoning because not relevant to the post.]

I guess I'm just really sad. I genuinely love him and want him to be okay. I'm concerned for his well-being. I know it's my responsibility but I just feel SAD. I want him to be okay. I want me to be okay. I want his current girl to be okay. I don't want to say negative things about any of them. I'm so sad because this is a 180 from what he said on our phone call. Things were going so well. 

I reached out to one of his friends who liked me a lot as a hail mary, hoping she'll talk to me. I hope that comes through. There are other things I can do but right now, I literally have 0 anger. Just sad. 

Anyway I'm just sad and could use some support. **And if I could request that people don't trash my ex that would be great.** It's just upsetting to read, ya know? Positive vibes, even when sad. : , (",0

What does a UTI FEEL like for you?,1,djzcfl,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/djzcfl/what_does_a_uti_feel_like_for_you/,6,1571490666.0,"I’m asking because I’ve been getting UTIs/bladder infections since I was a kid (now in my 20s) and I’ve felt like it doesn’t “match up” properly with the usual symptoms. 

I’ve always identified it primarily by a pain in my vaginal region - specifically I’ve always felt like the pain is near enough under my clitoris and close to the vaginal opening. These days I understand that this pain is probably right where my urethra is which makes a lot of sense to me but contradicts what I read whenever I get a UTI, (usually the NHS Health pages etc). When they refer to pain they refer to “lower abdomen pain” and I can’t tell if that’s polite doctor code for “pain right in the ol’ vulva land” or if it really is usually in the “lower abdomen” - which I consider to be above my vulva and all its internal makeups - and my situation just doesn’t fit the normal bill. 

So I’m curious - since every person’s body is different, what does a UTI feel like FOR YOU personally? I’m partially looking to hear other people back up my personal experience and also wondering how widely the experience changes from body to body!

[EDIT - to clarify, this pain isn’t STI-related, I’ve had my sexual health check up in the last 3 months and I’m all good - and as I’ve said, have been experiencing this since I was only a kid.]",1

"So I ended up at one of those ""Pregnancy Clinics"" that is actually a ridiculous Christian anti-abortion charity yesterday.",202,djejmq,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/djejmq/so_i_ended_up_at_one_of_those_pregnancy_clinics/,25,1571383182.0,"So I recently lost my job and am in the process of starting a new one but I'm between health insurances right now so I needed to have a pregnancy test done because I'm over a month late on my period and have been having all of the typical pregnancy symptoms. I have PCOS but skipping periods isn't normal for my specific case (I have extremely heavy painful periods but they're like clockwork) and I haven't been taking any birth control lately but every time I take a home test it comes back negative.

We are in the process of moving so we are a little short on cash, and a coworker recommended this local place that does free pregnancy tests. I am really looking to get a blood test done because I've worked in a doctor's office so I know the urine tests are identical to the ones from the dollar store, but I think that it is at least the first step to getting one done. I look up the place, they seem legitimate, so I call them and they ask me to come in within the next hour. 

I get there with my husband and am immediately taken into the back with no offer to have him come back with me. Immediately I realize that I'm not at a clinic and it looks more like the psychiatrist office I used to go to. They give me some forms to fill out and I read them and find out that no one there is actually a healthcare professional as stated in their disclaimer and that they cannot diagnose pregnancy. Uhhh? Okay...I'm already in this so I decide to just go with it. (I had told the woman on the phone that I had taken several home tests that were negative and I was looking for hopefully some lab work to find out for sure and she said that they would be able to help me.)

The lady finally calls me back into a room similar to my therapist's office and tells me we have some paperwork to go over first. She finds out that I am married and that if I am pregnant I plan on keeping the baby. She then proceeds to awkwardly give me the handouts on STDs which goes through the whole slut shaming tactic of scaring you by claiming you've slept with every person your partner has slept with and so on. She then proceeds to ask me how I think I can get to Heaven (I identify as Agnostic but live in the bible belt so I'm used to playing off questions of a religious nature) and then proceeds to lecture me for literally 45 minutes about accepting Jesus Christ as my lord and savior. In hindsight I think this would be where I would've been lectured about keeping my legs closed in the first place and given the abstinence lecture but me being married must have thrown her off.

By this point I was about ready to get up and leave but since I am incredibly non-confrontational I decided to wait it out and see if they at least had any recommendations as to where I could go get some discounted lab work done at the end. They didn't. I then proceeded to pee in a cup and then administer and read my own pregnancy test, which ended up being negative, and left. 

The more I think about it the angrier I get because I had a mild experience compared to what people who are genuinely seeking help with unexpected pregnancies go through. I can't imagine what would've happened if I had told them I wanted to terminate. They claimed to be judgement free and to have resources for everyone regardless of what their plan is moving forward. I've heard about places like this but I never thought I would end up at one.

TL;DR: Needed pregnancy test, ended up sitting through a church sermon, saved myself from having to buy a $1 test at Dollar Tree, not worth it",202

She got me in that day and the dr felt it (also gave me another breast exam) and said “i feel this is benign as it’s very round and moveable but I’m going to send you downstairs for a ultrasound because any mass needs to be imaged”....okay great. I went downstairs and i had my SECOND ultrasound of the year 6 months ago both my boobs had nothing in them this time there were two findings 

I wait for the radiologist to come in because they give you same day image results and he tells me I have two cysts one is a simple fluid filled cyst at 11mm and the other one that i actually feel is a 5mm “complex/complicated” cyst and he just wants me to come back in 6 months for a rescan no biopsy necessary at this point.

Is it good they didn’t want to biopsy yet? I’m nervous because complex cysts can sometimes be cancerous. How do i chill for 6 months? Should i be worried?",1
How do you draw the line between worrying you’re overreacting and allowing yourself to take your symptoms seriously?,7,djr4kq,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/djr4kq/how_do_you_draw_the_line_between_worrying_youre/,4,1571449922.0,"I know women have historically been dismissed in every circumstance, but this carries over in a very specific way in the medical field.

I’ve always found it hard to go to doctors about my health concerns, because when I have, I’ve been dismissed 95% of the time. But recently I’ve been experiencing mild chest pains, back pain, serious fatigue. And I know these are all combined symptoms of a silent heart attack. Every time I feel the pain - I think of the fact that medical professionals say you should ALWAYS go to the hospital if you have chest pain. But what if I’m overreacting? What if it isn’t a heart attack? What if I’m wasting their time and I look like an idiot?

Last week, I came back home after a night out. Alone on a dark street, a man jumped in front of me, blocking my way and pulled his d*ck out.

Evolution takes it's course in relative silence for the planet, for spoiler reasons.

The society that develops among the spiders is interesting, including a specific issue regarding sex, and gender dynamics.

He is not prey.""), but having things that come from their history that turn into culture, and how that clashes itself with this change and empathy.

Long story short, it was a disaster for a variety of reasons. But his brother was the straw that broke the camel's back.

His brother is both an alcoholic and a run-of-the-mill entitled manchild who regularly  makes mysoginistic and vaguely sexual comments about girls and women. I smiled and ignored it. He made comments about how we are soul mates (I ocassionally suffer from bouts of sarcastic melancholy myself) and how I'm dating the wrong brother. Random texts in the middle of the night.

Creepy, but easily glossed over.

One day I was working in the living room and he came up behind me and kissed me on the head. I froze and he walked away. 

The next night we were hanging out with his family and he started blowing me kisses and winks across the room. They got up to leave and he started to tell me how he talks about me to his students, how we are kindred spirits. I laughed nervously. He raised an eyebrow and stood in front of my chair looking down at me.

""I've been flirting with you all night."" He said, standing in front of my chair and looking down. Hes 6 foot and I'm 5""2.

""That's ok."" I said and looked at my hands. The f****er reaches down and pulls my chin up to look him in the eyes. 

I've had my chin grabbed before. That's a touch that screams aggression, sex, or both. It's a precursor to bad things. It takes away the power to hide in your brain, the last place you can hide when bad things are happening.

He walked away but the damage is done. I hate him. I hate him and I dont want him at the wedding. He doesnt deserve to be there. 

I didnt make a big deal about it at the time. My fiance and his mom both know what happened but I dont think they understand. His mom doesnt care. His brother never apologized, and his drinking has gotten worse. My fiance still wants him as a best man.

It's not right to ask him to keep his brother out of the wedding party. I'm not going to ask him to. 

I'm not one of THOSE girls, right?",19

I'm currently in a relationship and I love my boyfriend very much, but I'm a very paranoid person and sometimes I just think things like what if there's something I don't know about him. We've never gotten into a fight and I hear horror stories of women who have gotten into fights with their partner and it ended very badly. Like, abuse badly. But I sometime think like what if he's that type of person when he's angry. Or maybe he has some dark secret and he's actually something akin to a horror movie villain and is just luring me into a false sense of security before he hurts me. As silly as that sounds, I think about it sometimes.

It really scares me, and I hate that I even feel like this sometimes because he is the sweetest man I have ever met and I love him dearly. I know he's not any of that. I love him and trust him. He's never been anything but kind to me. I know he would never do anything to hurt me or make me feel bad, but yet there's just that sense of anxiety and paranoia that he isn't what he seems.",0

Best place to buy a supportive bra? Bad back pain!!,2,djn7in,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/djn7in/best_place_to_buy_a_supportive_bra_bad_back_pain/,9,1571432625.0,"Morning!

Finding a good bra has been an uphill battle. I have a large bust, narrow back, small shoulders, and am under five feet. 

The best fitting size I’ve worn is 34DDD, but I’m not 100% sure if that’s exactly right.

I’ve dealt with badly fitting department store bras lately, settling for 36DD when they occasionally have it. But now I’m in a job where I’m on my feet all day- so my mid-back pain has gotten *much* worse. Now I’m willing to splurge a bit more, in hopes I won’t need back surgery someday lol.

But before heading off to Victoria’s Secret, I’m wondering if that’s really the best place. There’s also a Soma near me, but it seems pretty much the same as VS.

I don’t know if trying out a little boutique would be good. I’m sure they’re more expensive, but I wouldn’t mind if they’re more supportive, better fitting, and at least same quality as VS/Soma.

Or should I try special ordering? I’ve heard good things about that, but I’m worried it would be out of budget. Anything more than around $100 I just couldn’t swing.

I’d absolutely love any advice!! I’m the only woman in my family/friends with this problem, no idea who else to ask.

Thanks!!",2

So, a bit of a background. I haven’t really been in many relationships in my life, and I’ve only really had one “one night stand” that didn’t really end in anything sexual.

That being said, I’m pretty sure I lost my virginity when I had to have an internal ultrasound done.

Now, I’ve been with this one guy a few months now. He’s amazing and I absolutely love him. Thing is, we haven’t had sex yet. Why? Well, he’s... very big. And I’m here with my never-really-had-sex-only-ultrasound vagina. So we tried a few times, but it just didn’t work. Hurts like hell and I can’t push through. 

So really, I’m asking for advice. I don’t really know what to do, how to, I don’t know, dilate my vagina? Is that a thing? I have no idea honestly and I just wanted to ask - have any of you experienced something like this? How did you succeed eventually?",3

I have always been able to function fine, people who don't know me well even describe me as friendly or outgoing because I know how to ""turn it on"" when I have to.  In the past couple years my anxiety has gotten progressively worse though.  It started affecting my job performance because I just become very overwhelmed dealing with people but transferring to a different section with less personal interaction helped resolve that for the most part.  The biggest thing for me in the past couple years has been since we bought our house though.  It seems really silly but I don't sleep most nights and I'm just generally irritable toward even my husband becasue I'm so worried about things going wrong with the house.  My husband gets it because it's the biggest financial commitment we've ever made but at the same time he is able to not worry about things until they actually happen wheras I am up all night thinking about the million things that could go wrong.  

All this to say I know this isn't a normal amount of anxiety to have about anything and it's taken me a long time to admit this but I think I need help to get past this and start living a normal life again.  The thing is I don't really know where to start.  My insurance sucks and only covers child psychologists.  Therapists charge $200-250 per session and want you to come every week.  Do I go to my general practitioner and tell her I have anxiety?  I don't really want to be medicated as I've never taken any kind of medication in my life and I'm scared what the side effects might be but that might be my only option financially right now.  We can't afford $1000/mo for therapy.  Does anyone have any advice or guidance?  I would be very grateful.",0

Coping with sexual assault years later,6,djjp2r,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/djjp2r/coping_with_sexual_assault_years_later/,4,1571410401.0,"Hello all.

I am not really sure what I am looking for here, probably just some support. 

Ever since that me too movement came about I have found myself reliving all the times I was assaulted and the times I may have been assaulted or raped and just have no idea. I realize now I never really dealt with them or healed from them....I just pretended like they never happened. I come from a bad home life where I was never loved properly....so it lead me to look for love in all the wrong places. I put myself into alot of bad situations where I consented to being in those situations. I am not here to say I never made mistakes or did anything wrong. I made alot of bad choices when I was young. I drank alot and did a ton of drugs to escape how I was really feeling. I don't know how many guys I have slept with and I can't tell you all their names. But I can tell you about the times I got so drunk and passed out at a party and woke up to boys touching me. And these were never strangers. I knew them. They were ""friends"". One, in particular, was someone I called a best friend and who I continued to love and call my best friend even after he assaulted me. I was in so much shock and disbelief I wanted to pretend like it never happened. So that's what I did. It haunts me to this day. 

I have a daughter of my own now and it makes me physically sick to think about the day I have to explain to her what boys can be like. How she needs to be careful and to never pass out at a party, even if she trusts everyone there. I thought I could trust people. But I can tell you about at least 5 times I have been assaulted while unconcious. I can tell you about a time where I woke up to my pants being undone and it was clear to me someone else had been down there. I can tell you about a time where I woke up to 2 guys touching me and masturbating beside me. I can tell you about the time my own uncle tried to get me into bed with him and then when I told the truth he told everyone I am a liar. And now we don't speak to that side of the family....for the best. 

Like I said, I don't know what I am hoping to gain from writing this post. I guess I am just tired of carrying this around with me lately....and I know that I am not alone. 

Fuck all you motherfuckers who think it's okay to assault others. Fuck you fuck you fuck you. You took something from us that we can never get back. 

I went so many years before this all really started to bother me.....I guess once I stopped partying and escaping reality, it had to catch up sometime. 

It hasn't helped that I have physically had to stop guys from raping my friends or girls I don't even know. 

My god, what the fuck is wrong with the world. 

Anyway, thanks for listening. Rant over. 

Ps. I should add that yes I am seeking counselling. I am seeing someone for what I thought were unrelated issues, but now am starting to see how maybe this is affecting my life in a much deeper way than I thought.

Edit: just want to add to a remark I made about not knowing if I have been raped. Well, since it was such a regular pattern of boys taking advantage of me while unconscious, I have wondered if there were other times I consented to sex at the time but passed out during and that didn't stop them. Or I know that there were times I was very very messed up and not really present in what was happening. So I am not saying I was raped, I am just saying I have no fucking clue about some situations.",6

Depending on the laws in your country you can do more or less harm to an attacker. For lesser dammage deodorant works perfectly because it still stuns, for a mid dammage cologne or small pepper spray and for real dammage (serious stuff) strong alcohol (this one is best to keep at home as it can lead to serious harm)

As the title says, I just feel like the network of trusted people I've built is crumbling. I broke up with my boyfriend a few weeks ago for a number of reasons (long story short, it was not a healthy relationship) and I've been happier since then, but in the time since that happened, both my sister and my best friend have independently decided to move away soon - across the country in the next few months.

My sister is my best friend and I trust her more than anyone. We don't agree on everything, but I know that she's on my side no matter what, and she feels the same about me. She's moving several states away in less than 6 months, and while I'm really happy for her, I'm going to miss her dearly. I'm a 22-year-old barista, I don't really make enough money for cross-country visits, so I'll barely see her at all once she leaves.

Then tonight, my best friend (and coworker) told me that he's decided to move to New York after he finishes this semester of college. Again, I'm really happy for him, but the news hit me like a brick. It caught me off guard because we had been making plans to start a coffee shop together and travelling to different places to learn about the coffee trade - tentative plans for a longer-term situation. Now the thought that he's leaving just kind of derails everything.

I broke down ugly-crying a few minutes ago on my drive home. It feels like all of a sudden everyone that I'm close to is leaving for one reason or another, and it finally reached a sort of breaking point where I just feel lost. I've had a lot of problems with psychiatric issues in the past, and though I've become (for the most part) stable, I'm still on psych meds and seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist regularly. I can't really go anywhere permanantly without first making arrangements to change providers and therapists and all of that, which terrifies me, but my ties to my hometown are rapidly dwindling and the longer I'm here, the less I want to be.

I feel small and powerless right now. I don't really want to bring this up to my sister or my friend because I want to be supportive and not make them feel like I'm trying to guilt them into staying. At the same time, the only people I would vent to this about are the people who are leaving! So I came here. I have no idea what to do, or if there's anything *to* do.

Hello ladies,

Just wanted to throw this out there in case it can help anyone else. I’m not a doctor and am just sharing my own personal experience.

To start off, I’m just going to say that I’ve never had the best sex life. I obviously had a higher drive as a teenager, but due to religious restrictions never really had any kind of sexual encounter until I was in my early twenties. By then, something had changed and my drive plummeted. It’s been hard because my boyfriend has a high sex drive and sex just doesn’t naturally cross my mind as a fun thing to do. I always thought it was mental and I would read books, but toys, and do anything in my power to just *try to be interested in it*, but to no avail. Even though my boyfriend is entirely understanding, I still felt like my sex drive was just “broken,” somehow. 

Then last week I was shopping at Trader Joe’s and saw a bottle of Vitamin D-3 for 4.99. I had recently read that the majority of people are deficient in Vitamin D and thought that with winter coming maybe I could see if it makes any difference for seasonal depression. I don’t really know what my reasoning was but I threw it in my cart and carried on. 

I started taking 1 pill a day and YOU GUYS. The affect was immediate! I had a big meeting the next day and I was sitting at a table full of people thinking, “I would literally sleep with any man at this table right now if they asked me to. Where’s the closest janitor’s closet? What about a car? Are there any hotels near by?” When my boyfriend came home I practically jumped him. He was shocked. The next day? The same thing. Then the next day and next day. Like I mentioned, it’s been about a week now and the results are the same, and I can’t think of any other thing that I’ve changed. 

I searched this sub and didn’t see anything about this, although a wonky sex drive is a popular subject on here, so I just thought I’d share! 

TLDR: Vitamin D begets more Vitamin D",5
"Fiancé and I are trying for a baby. 5 years ago I attempted suicide, and I’m so grateful for how everything got better.",65,dj5bb2,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dj5bb2/fiancé_and_i_are_trying_for_a_baby_5_years_ago_i/,8,1571342100.0,"I am writing this with tears streaming down my face- (could be happy tears, or just hormones- who knows?) 
Five years ago, I was in an awful place. I had just come through a traumatic situation, and was dealing with the fallout of it, albeit alone. Looking back to it is all a haze as if it’s someone else’s memory, but I do know it was all truly awful, resulting in me attempting to take my own life. I didn’t want to be around, and I hated myself. I would wish that I wouldn’t wake up every night I went to sleep. 

Growing up I never found my ‘place’. Not with people, hobbies, or my family. I didn’t seem to click with anyone, so in my mind I was pretty sure that I was never going to find a partner in the future. 

So, when I met my fiancé through a case of pure luck, I was elated, excited and surprised. My mom had a friend who brought him over in a case of matchmaking. We’ve been inseparable ever since. 

I’m not saying he ‘saved’ me, but it sure as hell helped being loved to help me love myself. We fought my demons together. 
On days I couldn’t leave the house, he was there straight away. When I was looking absolutely awful- no makeup, acne, unbrushed hair, throwing up from stress- he didn’t mind, and made sure I ate, and looked after myself. Even when I was at my lowest, he would still make me laugh like no one else could. 

I knew straight away that I had found my ‘place’ with him. I’m now in recovery and my scars have healed, both physically and mentally. I still have bad moments, but they pass. 
We’re now celebrating 4 years together, moving in together, and now trying for a baby. I’m truly happy, I feel lucky everyday with him, and more importantly I hope that this shows that things do get better, they can, and they will.",65

"I hate being an intelligent woman, and always being the one expected to make career and life sacrifices so that my male partners can be happy",12,djb3zc,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/djb3zc/i_hate_being_an_intelligent_woman_and_always/,9,1571368414.0,"I’m in my 30s and every single man I’ve ever dated has wanted one thing in the end: for me to be a supporting character in their life and nothing more. 

So many men pay lip service to appreciating intelligent and independent women, but it’s all bullshit. Whenever a situation arises where a compromise needs to be made, especially involving careers or life goals, I am ALWAYS the one that’s expected to bend over backwards to inconvenience myself so that everyone but me can be happy. It feels like a given that my career, financial independence and contributions, free time, hopes, and life dreams are less important just because I’m a woman.

My last major relationship ended because my partner was upset that I chose to go back to school for a science degree. He became passive aggressive, antagonizing my efforts to study and constantly making nasty comments about female scientists and doctors not having time for their families. He acted entitled to my time, and treated me like his personal housekeeper and receptionist, and was mad that I no longer had time to do all of his own basic adult responsibilities for him, for free. After ditching him, I decided that I was never having kids or going to be financially dependent on a partner. 

Now I’m in the same boat again, finishing the degree and applying to grad school. My current boyfriend is also childfree, initially seemed thrilled that I wanted to be a researcher, and assured me months ago that he would be fine moving for grad school as long as it was within our state. Now he is throwing a fit about the possibility of even having to move 45 minutes away. He insists that I should just apply to one graduate program in our current town and take the risk of not getting in, which would set me back another year and a half. Meanwhile, he is in community college for a non-science degree and has a lot more flexibility than I do when it comes to where he can go to school. Much like my ex, he gets upset and passive aggressive if I don’t have time to take care of basic household shit that shouldn’t be my responsibility. And I always end up doing way more than my fair share of housework and errands. And if it matters, I’ve also been paying around 70-80% of our bills for the last 2 years, so it’s not even like he has that as an excuse.

Ive always wanted to date someone on my intellectual level, because I can’t imagine having a life partner that I can’t share interests or deep conversations with. My female friends and classmates feel the same way, and also struggle with relationships. But the men I go to school with who also want to be doctors and scientists are the opposite and seek out women who seem to be significantly below their intellectual level, often very shallow or materialistic, and with no ambitions in life. I just don’t understand how anyone could be happy with a life partner that they have so little in common with. I also don’t understand why so many men seem to want a partner that’s financially dependent on them, rather than someone who also works and pays half the bills like a responsible adult. It feels like we’re still stuck in the 50s, and I live in a very progressive part of California. 

When I look at the relationships around me, I see the same pattern. Even the people who seem outwardly happy together and have been married for decades. Men who have been told their whole lives that they get to be the heroes of their own lives, and that women are just supporting characters to make their lives easier. Women who always make sacrifices and inconvenience themselves, as if it’s their unspoken duty in life. And resentment and passive aggression anytime this balance is offset, even by a little. 

It’s all very depressing, and I wish I had either been born as a man or at the very least, as a stupid woman that could genuinely be happy constantly deferring to my partner. At this point, I’m starting to accept that I’m probably going to be alone for a very long time.",12

It has been an on/off relationship where we've broken up and patched up countless times.
I love everything about her but something in my heart tells me she's not the one.

I also have feelings about exploring and feel like I'm missing out the prime of my youth and won't get this time again.
She has all the qualities I would want in a girlfriend but I still feel hollow. 

I also feel like I can't talk about it to my friends because we have common friends and I keep thinking about how she would feel if we broke up. 

Whenever we have broken up, she's always found it hard to cope with it and I feel like she'd breakdown if I did it for real and can't stop thinking about it.. I deeply care about her and this is partly the reason I can't make myself commit to the break up because I'm so concerned about her but at the same time I want to think about myself too (am I being selfish?)

I apologize if this post is confusing.. it's only because I'm really confused and I just wanted to share it somewhere.

I would really like to make sense of it.",1

Morning sickness, doctors appointments, body changes, stretch marks, hormones all over the place, etc. Not to mention the thought of giving birth literally makes me want to vomit/cry/die all at once. It's absolutely horrifying to me.

That being said, I'm totally willing to adopt a kid, but I know that's a tricky process. I'm fairly certain I will marry my boyfriend (who I've been with for 4+ years), and I think he wants his own children.

Prosecutor Needs Opinions From Victims of Rape or Sexual Assault Re: Their Experience with Prosecution,6,djegz9,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/djegz9/prosecutor_needs_opinions_from_victims_of_rape_or/,13,1571382847.0,"Hello everyone! I want to start by saying that this conversation might be triggering for those who have been affected by sexual violence. Please proceed with caution and take care of yourself if you are triggered!

I am a prosecutor who handles sex offense cases. I recently had an influx of rape cases with victims who had been drinking at a party and then were raped after they had passed out or were conscious but really too drunk to consent or fight what was going on. 
The suspects are charged with rape: the highest level offense you can get for a sex crime in my state. They are also charged with lesser-included offenses of sexual battery: it is one step down on the felony chart. 
In my state, a big difference between rape and sexual battery comes during sentencing: rape carries much higher consequences, requires mandatory reporting for life, and overall is the highest degree felony besides murder. 

Let’s just say for argument sake that the evidence in these cases is really quite good to support a rape: DNA, witnesses saying the victim was drinking and passing out, etc. 

I’ve talked and met with the victims a few times. And the victims, quite understandably, do not want to testify and are still handling trauma from the events. They are not at a point in their trauma therapy that they can quite talk about the incident without really going through a bad physical and psychological reaction. They, understandably, absolutely do not want to testify and be subject to cross examination and the court process. 

On some of the cases, I could potentially resolve the cases by allowing the defendant to admit to the lesser included charge of sexual battery. However, that means they aren’t classified for life as a rapist and they get a much more lenient sentencing. And I just feel like it’s adding to the culture that doesn’t take rape seriously. 
The victims usually would prefer it gets plead out to the lesser included. I usually want to press forward with the rape charge. But I also have to balance that the victim will face emotional harm, there is always a chance the defendant could be found not guilty (juries can be strange), and that a trial is a trying process for the family of the victim as well. 

Survivors of sexual assault, what do you think? Did you have a criminal case that went to trial? What was the outcome? If your attacker was found not guilty, how did you handle that? Would it have been better if it just pleaded out? Was your prosecutor too pushy or not pushy enough with wanting to go forward on a rape charge? 
What things did the prosecutor do that made the process easier or harder? 
I am not sure how much I should push the victims on my cases to testify vs. just pleading the case out. 

Thank you for all of your help. 
And to all the survivors, please know that I am always in awe at how resilient you all are. I hope that you all are in a good place.",6

Growing apart is scary because you realize that some of the loving things you did for someone just aren't part of your routine anymore, but you don't want them to feel like you don't love them the same. 

Its scary to talk to them about it too because you have to acknowledge openly that things aren't the same and that's not a very comfortable conversation.

**What are some good ways to initiate conversation about bringing back old loving habits you used to do for someone? And what are some good new ones to introduce?**

How does it make you feel when men are angry?,7,djc9pk,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/djc9pk/how_does_it_make_you_feel_when_men_are_angry/,15,1571373184.0,"I know this is sort of a weird question but I come from an abusive childhood where my dad would be cold and silent to the family for 90% of the time and then suddenly burst into a terrifying rage at the most random, unrelated thing - a toy is out of place, mom made the wrong dinner, it's too hot in the living, etc. He would scream, throw things, destroy the house. 18 years of that made me really anxious and submissive. I'm 21 now and out of the house but I still just don't know to deal with other people's anger, especially men's. For me, any kind of show of anger, not even rage-tantrums, makes my stomach churn into knots, my hands get cold, I start to get numb and dizzy, and I completely freeze, barely breathing. It's like I return back to my 11 year old self again when I see guys get angry, basically trying to make myself as small and quiet as possible so I don't get hurt in the crossfire.

So I just wonder like, how do other people feel? How do normal people react and feel? Do you feel any fear? Is my reaction somewhat normal too? Totally abnormal?

ETA: I should mention that I don't get this way with angry women though. Depending on the situation, I either feel neutral or actually calmer so I can stay in control. It's only with men that I start feeling sweaty and scared and nervous :(",7
"Is there a way to balance wanting to be well informed about women's issues and problems, and suffering from Compassion fatigue and activist burnout from unrelentingly being pounded with cruelty against women?",10,djakw7,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/djakw7/is_there_a_way_to_balance_wanting_to_be_well/,3,1571366134.0,"I'm a graduate student and activist. And I don't really get a break from women's rights issues, as even my academic work revolves around it. The paper I'm working on now deals with abuse against women, and has affected me very personally. Sometimes I feel like I don't have a right to be depressed and traumatized just from reading something in the safety of my room. It can't be compared with the women who suffered it, or even just counselors who talk to them in person. I feel like I'm being over-sensitive for feeling anxiety over things I've experienced entirely second hand. 

I'm not saying you are in the same shoes as me. But I think every person on TwoXChromosomes can relate to some degree. In that every day there are many self posts and links to abuse and extreme cruelty against women. And we want to have empathy and compassion for them. But if we have to feel personally 30 times a day, it will burn out our emotions. Yet I don't want to feel cold towards women in need either. 

Sometimes I do just want to hide from current events and any experiences that give negative feelings. I'm not complaining about ""negativity"". I believe these stories need to be shared and should not be suffered in silence. But as a reader it takes its toll on me.

Has anyone else felt these feelings, either on Reddit, or from activism outside? How do you deal with and manage it in your own life?",10

"With Halloween almost here, some quick thoughts on Lilith - a long, but fun read.",0,djnvor,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/djnvor/with_halloween_almost_here_some_quick_thoughts_on/,4,1571435865.0,"Lilith

It took 325 years after Jesus' given birth year for the new Christian church to finalize their version of the Bible.  In picking and choosing which stories would be used, which altered, and which thrown away, the Pope and the Nicaean Council set the tenure of Christian mythology.

One story that was semi-discarded is the tale of Lilith, Adam's first wife.  But Lilith still appears in the two versions of the Creation story in the opening of Genesis, in Jewish myth, and in Pagan stories.

God made Adam from the clay of the earth in God's own image.  Because Adam needed a 'help-mate' God then made him a woman from the same clay, whose name was Lilith.  Lilith is therefore created from the same materials, in the same manner, and at the same time as Adam, with the same attributes. 

She is the doubleganger of Adam.  Just as you can not have a coin with one side, you can not have a copy of God's best (Adam) without also having a copy of God's worst (Lilith).

Lilith, being the evil side of Adam, is seen as the first demon.  She wanted to over throw God and rule Earth herself.  To do so she set up a Throne for herself in Eden and gathered all the animals to her in her plan to go to war with God.  When she tried to gather Adam to her Adam, instead of dealing with Lilith himself, told God and God threw Lilith out of Eden - banished - banshee (banned she) - Lilith.  

Adam's first wife is the forerunner of Satan, with the change being Satan was condemned to Hell but rules Earth, while Lilith is condemned to roam Earth with no place to rest for eternity.

God then takes a rib from Adam and creates Eve, Adam's second wife.  By creating Eve from Adam's rib, God makes Eve a flawed clone of Adam - she is something that looks, acts, and thinks like Adam but is less than he as she is only from a minor part of him.  Not made from his heart or head, but from a rib.  Eve is the flawed copy of God's best.

Eve is lured into sinning by the serpent in the Garden into eating the apple, and then Eve lures Adam into sin by giving him the apple at which point both man and woman are expelled from Eden.  

So, who is the serpent and how did it get into the Garden of Eden?  Lilith is and God made her, the demon, and put her there.  So sin is woman (Lilith) and woman lead man into sin (Eve) and Adam is just another brow-beaten, victimized, poor male schmuck who won't accept responsibility for his own actions with either wife. 

""The Devil - my wives - made me do it!!!""
