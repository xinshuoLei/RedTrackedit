Your Essential Guide to Showerthoughts,5514,bg71oh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/bg71oh/your_essential_guide_to_showerthoughts/,322,1555994168.0,"The human brain is a decidedly odd machine, often prone to glitches, malfunctions, and internal errors (like inexplicably deciding that raisins are an acceptable addition to cookies). However, within the confines of that chaos, something intriguing occasionally occurs: A seemingly mundane detail about the world will suddenly become more interesting, having been viewed from a slightly different perspective than usual.

This sort of miniature epiphany is called a showerthought.

If you’ve ever realized that “Wet Paint” signs probably cause more stained fingertips than wet paint does on its own, you’ve had a showerthought. If you’ve ever noticed that human hair is technically a renewable resource, you’ve had a showerthought. These sorts of musings tend to arise while a person’s mind is engaged with a routine, uncomplicated activity (like commuting, mowing the lawn, or waiting for a customer service representative to finally answer their allegedly important telephone call), and while the word “showerthought” may be a bit misleading – showerthoughts don’t have to occur in the shower, after all – the concept it embodies is something which everyone has experienced.

------

/r/Showerthoughts is a repository for showerthoughts; a place to share, discuss, and debate those sudden flashes of simple satori. In order to make the community as welcoming an environment as possible, we’ve put together some resources for potential submitters.

[The Overview](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/overview) will give you an idea of what a showerthought actually is.

[The FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/faq) will (hopefully) answer most enquires you’d have about the subreddit. 

[The Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/rules) will offer some guidelines on what should and should not be posted here.

[Google](http://www.google.com) will help you determine if your thought is original and unique.

[This GIF](https://i.imgur.com/idPw9nQ.gifv) will not improve your life in any way.

We encourage everyone to read through those first three pages before participating here, just as we encourage our subscribers to report any rule-violating submissions that they happen upon. Other than that, though, we’d like to leave you with a paraphrasing of a very important proverb:

Be excellent to each other… and ponder on, dudes!",2019-04-23 12:36:08
"The Quintessential Showerthought, Issue #1 - Of Appendages, Adventures, and Arachnids",3115,bpql00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/bpql00/the_quintessential_showerthought_issue_1_of/,103,1558124569.0,"Greetings, showerthinkers!

Every so often, a person will encounter an idea that changes the way they think about the world. Sometimes these notions are amusing, and other times they’re downright scary, but regardless of their tone, they almost always leave us just a little bit more enlightened than we were before... provided that we regard ""enlightenment"" as a state that can occasionally cause other people to slowly back away. Musings of this nature can be prompted by almost anything; can be found almost anywhere, hidden in the mundanities of everyday life. When we allow ourselves to see them – when we look at something obvious from a unique perspective – we experience a showerthought.

In case it wasn’t evident, that’s the theme of this subreddit.

The word ""showerthought"" is a bit of a misnomer, though, given that the phenomenon it describes doesn’t require the presence of running water or soap. Furthermore, the term is a little bit difficult to define, especially since it almost seems like it describes a state of mind more than a concrete concept. As a result, many people are understandably confused about what a showerthought actually *is*... and in order to help with that, we’ve decided to periodically compile a list of excellent examples, which we are titling as such:

**The Quintessential Showerthought**      

Now, the thoughts that we’ll be featuring in this list aren’t necessarily the best-written or most-insightful exhibitions of what the subreddit aims to showcase. (Some of them might even be egregiously stupid on the surface.) Every last one of them does a noteworthy job in capturing the essence of a showerthought, though, which is why we’d like to present them to you now.

What you do with these new perspectives is up to you.*
