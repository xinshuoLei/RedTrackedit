Everyone said buying condoms was no big deal and nobody would say anything....,105378,a8vn3u,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/a8vn3u/everyone_said_buying_condoms_was_no_big_deal_and/,4743,1545609015.0,"Well that was a fucking lie.

I pull up at Walgreens and I walk over to the aisle with condoms. I go ‚Äúwell shit, I guess i need some deodorant too.‚Äù  So I pick some up and then grab a box of condoms.

I get to the checkout line, i‚Äôm standing there and this one old lady is like ‚Äúexcuse me son, mind me asking how old you are?‚Äù And i‚Äôm like ‚ÄúUmmm I‚Äôm 16?‚Äù Then she purses her lips and makes this judging ass face and says, ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you a little young to be using those?‚Äù

At this point the other 5 people in the line are all looking at me so I got angry and just started acting snarky. ‚ÄúOh, my bad lady, Imma just hit it raw and hope she don‚Äôt get knocked up.‚Äù  She felt offended so she shut up pretty quick. 

AND THEN when I get to the front of the line, the fucking cashier scans the box, smiles and says, ‚Äúfirst time with these?‚Äù Are you fucking kidding me? Why would he ask that? Whatever. I just said ‚ÄúUm no second actually.‚Äù (Even though it was actually my first).

Ughhh. Anyways I hate people. I just want to buy some condoms in peace damn.

Edit: Well of course my one post that gets any attention is about buying condoms smh

ATTENTION ALL TEENAGERS: This sub is an early breeding ground for future INCELS and we should work to prevent it.,55836,amhkb9,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/amhkb9/attention_all_teenagers_this_sub_is_an_early/,3898,1549165340.0,"Greetings,

I've been a pretty long time reader of this sub. I have noticed a lot of posts along the lines of ""I just asked my crush out"" etc. 

Those posts are totally fine. We all like the comradery and supporting a fellow peer; however, its the comments and some of the other posts that breed this incel culture.

From the front page of this subreddit today:

 [I'm having a date with my crush in about 3 hours](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/amcok2/im_having_a_date_with_my_crush_in_about_3_hours/)

>Jesus lucky bastard

>You lucky shit! 

>Thanks, although I don't think much will change. Rn I'm just lying in bed watching anime like the lazy piece of shit I am.

>Tell us if you bang her

>I've always become friends with my crushes... just friends...

>You lucky piece of shit....

The ""lucky"" comments seem to insinuate two things. First, that love and happiness is based on luck, and that these commentors are just unlucky and won't even find love. Second, there is a bit of bitterness and disdain toward the ""lucky"" person. Kind of like saying, ""Why this fucker and not me!!!!"" Additionally, this thread also had some pretty incel-specific comments (3rd and 6th). Some of the responses to those comments were along the lines of, ""oh don't worry it gets better you just need to wait it out"". NO! That is the worst thing you can tell someone in that situation! More on that later.

[Anyone else feel heartbroken despite never having had a girlfriend?](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/amdkvp/anyone_else_feel_heartbroken_despite_never_having/) - **200 upvotes**

>At least you got offers

>Yep, except I didn't had any offer...

This post was pretty good overall. A lot of the other comments were supportive.

>I know how fustrating it can be trust me. But you are feeling this way because you're focusing too much on the fact that someone might turn up and then they don't. You shouldn't let wanting a relationship affect how you act or do work, otherwise you'll fall into a depression

We should take the example of this guy above. When you see someone posting stuff like this, work to counteract it. Don't let your friends on this sub fall into this incel-ish mentality. They may not be a full incel yet, but these types of feeling are what create one in the future.

**Those two posts are just examples from today. There are many more out there. PLEASE BOIS, when you see a friend display incel tenancies, try to snap them out of it!**

*If you are an incel or pre-incel reading this post, here are some suggestions to snap out of it:*

- You can't just sit idle and ""wait for life to get better""! You have to get out and do something. Make something. BE SOMETHING. Sitting idle and waiting just allows someone to perpetuate their own grievances and get mad at the world that ""life is not getting better for me"". If you want your life to get better, you have to pull yourself up by your bootsraps and tell yourself ""I want to change"".

- Work out (strength, cardio, whatever). I can't tell you how amazing you will feel once you begin getting some exercise. It is almost like a drug, it's that good. 

- Bathe. You will feel good once you're clean.

- Talk to people in person. It's not as weird as you think to just randomly just start talking to someone (men or women).

- Stop doing drugs if you do them.

- Cut out the porn. You'll begin to see women as real people instead of sex objects. 

Thanks for reading.

**THE ONE AND ONLY EDIT:**

Quoting one of the replies:

>Why does no one see the point of this post. The point of this post wasn‚Äôt to call out kids who are depressed about not being in a relationship. The whole point was to just let people know about how incel behavior, given the right conditions, can manifest itself in teens as they grow older

>If this post prevents one depressed kid from becoming an incel in any way, then it‚Äôs done it‚Äôs job.

What this person said above is true. I've had numerous people PM me and say how they are going to improve themselves and turn themselves around. WONDERFUL! I'm glad this post accomplished something. A lot of the replies to his thread are completely disgusting. Not to mention the replies that perfectly exhibit the behavior I am trying to point out in this post.

Thanks to those that were able to have a civilized discussion.

To the teenager who came into my shop today with your mom,52338,axf7kt,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/axf7kt/to_the_teenager_who_came_into_my_shop_today_with/,2532,1551777905.0,"Your mom came in today asking for my help to invade your private life. She even brought you with her. I can‚Äôt imagine how embarrassing that must be. 

She asked me to go through your phone and computer and find any apps or photos that she wouldn‚Äôt approve of, because she was too technology illiterate to do it herself, all the while making you watch. (I work at a tech support shop) 

Personally I think this is an invasion of your personal space and privacy. 

So when I found the folder where you‚Äôd hid all your movies and games, I made sure to pretend I didn‚Äôt see them. 

On your phone, I told her that you didn‚Äôt have anything but the default apps and angry birds. 

And then, I showed her a place where she could look on your phone that would only show her the default apps, not the ones you downloaded. So hopefully when she invaded your space again, she won‚Äôt find anything. 

Was I wrong to do what I did? Probably. But you‚Äôre only a year or two away from adulthood and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs right that anyone be that intrusive, mother or not. 

Good luck in life man. Hope things get better for you soon. 


Edit: Thanks for the shiny medals! I‚Äôll be sure to take good care of them. 

Also, way too many comments to keep up with, but I‚Äôll try to read them all and respond :)

As some of you might be aware, a spinoff series of SpongeBob SquarePants known as ‚ÄúKamp Koral‚Äù is supposedly coming to fruition soon. Whatever you do, **DO NOT SUPPORT IT.** Don‚Äôt watch it, don‚Äôt promote it, don‚Äôt recommend it to anyone. This is spitting in the face of late Stephen Hillenburg (the creator of SBSQ), whom Nickelodeon *waited for to die* in order to go against his wishes. 

I‚Äôm only drawing attention to this to warn you all. This is disguised as something innocent, but it‚Äôs so indescribably fucked up. 
Don‚Äôt support Nickelodeon in general, if you can help it.

A bit weird to do that in school but ok whatever. This week my school also found out that one of the teachers had sexted with one of the students. Those are pretty messed up but not allowing students to date each other as a result? That is truly annoying and makes me furious

I fucking hate my school. Anyone else being homeschooled? 

Edit: So the Principal just fired the teacher who was caught sexting. Situation evolves it seems

Do NOT stick your dick inside a shampoo bottle,37568,b7ko4b,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/b7ko4b/do_not_stick_your_dick_inside_a_shampoo_bottle/,2228,1554041674.0,"TIFU fellow teens. Very badly.

&#x200B;

TLDR at bottom.

&#x200B;

To preface, I used to masturbate a lot, and still sometimes do. Usually, I do it in the shower. For around an hour (whenever I get the chance).

&#x200B;

So today I had the great idea based on the notion of ""since shampoo feels soft in my hands/hair, maybe it would feel good on my dick?"" So I took a whole bunch in my hand, and rubbed it all over. It felt good at first too, basically what you would imagine it to feel like.

&#x200B;

Then I got the great idea of sticking it in the shampoo bottle.

&#x200B;

With some effort (not to flex but my dick is pretty wide) I managed to get it in there completely. This was not a good idea. First of all, I couldn't even move it around cuz it was super tight. Like there was so much friction, it was stuck. And I couldn't move it out either. I started to panic. I looked like a complete idiot, my entire penis encased by this huge bottle. I tried jumping up and down, pulling it off with my hands, then my feet, it was such an ordeal.

&#x200B;

The entire time, my dick was floating around in shampoo-y substances, which wasn't a problem at first. Until it started FUCKING BURNING.

&#x200B;

HOLY HELL I cannot accurately describe the pain of having a burning schlong. It was this icy-fire feeling, that kept throbbing continuously. I could barely stop myself from screaming.  Tears and all, I was a mess.

&#x200B;

At this point I would do anything to get it off. So I figured out a plan, dried myself, put on my biggest pair of pants (some flannel) to hide the giant-ass shampoo bottle and a t-shirt so I could get some butter from the fridge. So as I'm making my way to the fridge, MY MOM tells me to come up to her room to ""talk about my academic failure,""

&#x200B;

I sat through 20 minutes of her talking shit about me with a freezing-burning penis. After that shit-show, I tried running back to my room. I was sweating, crying, and couldn't hold my own weight. I fell down on my knees and crawled the rest of the way to my room with my melted butter stick.

&#x200B;

To shorten a long process, I rubbed some butter over the lid, and after a while, the bottle popped off to reveal my burning-red manhood.

&#x200B;

As i'm writing this, my dick still hasn't fully healed, and I think I ripped the skin, which means no more masturbating for a while

&#x200B;

Lesson: Never, EVER, stick your dick in a shampoo bottle.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Got horny, thought it would be a good idea to put my dick into a shampoo bottle. Turned out not to be a good idea. Got stuck for 40 minutes. burning. ow. butter stick came off. shriveled, reddened cock.

&#x200B;

Update: Upon further examination, the skin is a couple shades redder than it usually is, I can see red enflamed muscle-y things where the skin peeled off, and the entire thing looks like armadillo skin. My dick was also bleeding from multiple exit points. FUCK WHY AM I SO STUPID

&#x200B;

Update 2: Its getting better, if I do nothing with it, it feels fine, shades of red are nearing normal skin color I think. Its mainly flaky skin which is bothering me but the red muscley parts are still there, not bleeding anymore. Thanks for the concern, but I think i'll be fine. ",2019-03-31 22:14:34

It all started in first grade gym class. We had a little course set up and you could go fuck around freely   at the end of the lesson. 

They had some ropes hanging from the ceiling that you could climb or swing on. I was climbing and slipped a little so I grabbed the rope tightly and straightened my legs to press the rope between my thighs. At that point what happened was very confusing to a 7 year old retard. I pissed my pants (witch later turned out to be cum) and slid down the rope mid-orgasm. I told my friend to climb the magic nut-rope, but he didn't believe. 

I still to this day wonder how my underdeveloped limp penis managed to crank one out.

We had even joked about who‚Äôs car would be faster when we grew up. All of his money went into his car. He had just recently bought some new stuff for his 2014 Camaro and was waiting to put it on. That car was going to look so good when he was done with it. I had recently gotten him into motorcycles too. He‚Äôs the reason I love cars so much, and he‚Äôs the reason I go to the gym. We even played Xbox all the time and he spent so much time playing forza. He would sit there for hours building a car and making a perfect tune for it.

I had a female student (I'm a male), who was rather attractive. Not gonna lie. But I would never pursue a student  romantically. Apparently, that feeling was not mutual. At first, things were like they usually were with stupid young girl crushing: double entendres, very subtle comments, etc. But there's a line, and she crossed it.

She wrote her number on an essay with a smiley face. This was not okay by any means. I immediately contacted an administrator so I wouldn't get in any trouble. These sorts of things are taken very seriously at pretty much any grade level these days, and I'm not interested in losing my job over some girl's hormones getting the best of her.

So a couple of days later, this administrator called a meeting with the parents. We were all in the office and the administrator was doing his spiel to the girl and her parents about appropriate behavior at school and appropriate age differences and the like (apparently this is a common enough issue that he had some training on how to have this kind of talk). She looked fairly ashamed, staring at the floor the whole time. He finished his rehearsed rant and then asked the parents if they had anything they wanted to say to the daughter. 

The father was silent, but the mother spoke up. She said something about how the girl should know better and how they taught her better than this, etc. The usual parent reprimand stuff. But teenage girls can often find ways to surprise you. The mom asked her daughter, ""And what did you even expect would come of something like this?"" My student was quiet for a moment, looking down at the floor still, but then she turned to me, and I will never forget the way she looked at me when she said it: ""About tree fiddy."" It was about this time I noticed that my student was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the paleozoic era. I said, ""Damn it, monsta, get out of this office! I ain't givin' you no damn tree fiddy!""",2019-04-15 04:57:24

I know its illegal, but anything is better than homelessness.

A little context. I'm not too popular. I'm always that one nerd kid, and the only time people would hear about me is if I won a math competition.

Well this year I changed that.

My school has posters up saying ""We encourage you to use your phones, tablets, and laptops."" The last one is what caught my eye. Because my school allows us to use our devices during lunch.

So I brought my laptop to school. For my first couple classes I would jokingly ask if I could use my laptop. But when lunch came around. Then things got good. I sat down at my normal lunch table and pulled out my laptop. Immediately people started eyeing me. Next I booted up my laptop. Now people were watching. Finally I got onto Minecraft and played some Hypixel Bedwars. I slowly gathered a crowd, and eventually people started chearing when I was winning.

When I won everyone went ballistic.

And that's how I became a god.

Edit: I don't have a way I can display proof. It may be on a Snapchat story or something, but I have no idea. I guess I was just at the right place at the right time. I did it kind of as a joke for my friends, but a lot more people noticed. My highschool separates the freshmen from everyone else. So it probably isn't as big of a crowd as some of you think, maybe 300 kids were at that lunch out of 1800. I can see how this can be thought of as karma farming now.

I almost died yesterday,31025,cfzgtr,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/cfzgtr/i_almost_died_yesterday/,1159,1563747542.0,"I live alone for university. While washing the dishes, I felt dizzy and lightheaded. My heart started palpitating and it felt like it was going a million miles a minute. I used the heart rate monitor on my phone and it was over 130 bpm.
My whole body was twitching and my chest was on fire. I started taking deep breaths but it was no good. I started sweating and could barely catch my breath. Something told me I might not make it. I called the emergency line and they took well over 30 minutes to answer. At that point I could barely form thoughts and had to force myself to utter the slightest sound. All I could do was keep shouting my address to the operator. I tried to call my mom but I couldn't operate my phone. I opened the apartment door then ran into the shower and stood under the cold running water for a few minutes then back out again. 

I was in denial. I kept thinking

""no it's impossible, I'm barely even 20 years old. I can't die, that's not how it works""

I then came to the realisation that people in fact do die and rarely do you ever expect it.

 I came to terms with my death at that moment.

I looked around the room seeing my medschool study notes and textbooks. They seemed so petty. I saw my paintings and thought about how much time i dedicated to getting better at all these things and how funny it is that nothing really mattered at the end because I'm going to die now. I didn't expect to die all alone in a small apartment in a foreign country where I can barely speak the language but I guessed that's just how it is. 

My heart felt like it was about to explode out of my chest. I felt every vessel in my body. Every capillary and every vein being flooded with rushing blood.

It was almost an hour later and the ambulance didn't arrive yet and I was laying on the ground twitching without signs of my heart slowing down. In fact, it was accelerating so much to the point where I couldn't tell individual beats, it just felt like a continuous buzz.

I passed out.

I woke up in the hospital with tubes in my arm, ECG wires attatched to my chest a breathing tube in my nose and a doctor with his crew trying to bring me back to consciousness. The second I came to, I realised that my heart rate was still through the roof. Seeing everything made me panic as well which didn't help with the heart rate. It kept fluctuating from 120-170 bpm for 8 hours straight, only slowing down for a little every 30 minutes or so. 

I felt like I was being tortured.

The doctors said that they detected toxins from a bacteria or virus in my blood (toxemia) which is probably from something I ate/drank. The toxins affected the myocardium (heart muscles) and cause the blood vessels to dialate which also reduced the blood pressure so the heart went into overdrive. I was told that having a heart rate that high for that long could have lead to a cardiac arrest at any moment and that it's surprising I was able to live through it. The fact that I was young helped and I guess all that cardio I do payed off. 

The body metabolised the toxins and i slowly felt better. 

I realised they left my glasses at home and I was blind for the ride home. 

Now every moment after this incident feels like extra bonus time. I feel like I wasn't supposed to experience this moment and that I escaped death somehow. I listened to a new song released and immediately felt like I wasn't supposed to experience this song.

It's such a surreal feeling. I think it's because I had time to take it in and already came to terms with my death that now everything feels like cheating it.

I'm not here to get all preachy and tell you to enjoy every moment of your life. Im here to simply say ""im alive"".

Edit: 

people are asking what country I'm in because of the emergency line. I live in italy.

Also suing for the medical bills is useless because you have free emergency healthcare in Europe.

And no I never found out what I ate that caused it.

Edit 2:

 I'm sorry I can't read the hundreds of comments and messages I'm receiving from this so please forgive me if I'm unable to respond. I'm really trying to get to every comment and message. I really truly appreciate all your kind words and support and I didn't expect this massive support. I'm truly blessed to be a part of this community. Thank you so much.",2019-07-22 06:19:02

I'm sorry for ruining the general good vibes of this subreddit by hilgihting something so terrible but this really concerns all teenagers, and this is the only subreddit I know that will upvote anything. I apologize to the mods if this is not the most appropiate, but I really belive this desrves to be heard, and almost all other subreddits seem to remove this post.


I don't know where to start, this is horrifying situation. The vast majority of the 150 million people of my country has had their internet access cut off just recently. Internet speeds in Bangladesh are now [1.28KBPS](https://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2018/08/04/authorities-slow-mobile-internet-to-quell-student-protests). That dot is not a typo. 1.28kbps is the actual speed.

I will make this as short as I can,

* It started when a 2 teenagers were killed by Bus who disobeyed traffic laws.
* Soon tens of thousands of  teenage and student protestors came out on the street enforcing traffic laws by thesmelves ensuring no one else has to die, all this incredibly peacefully.
* The government sent out, what I can only describe as their version of ""Hitler Youth""
* Rape, Murder, Assault by the Hitler Youth have been carried out. [very NSFL pictures here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/94ivyd/school_students_have_been_protesting_in_demand/e3ldg3t/)
*Any posts on Facebook, Youtube, that make light of these crimes against humanity seems to dissapear instantly.


[Bangladesh's Most Popular Yotuber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFhws2AfBEk) (think of PewDiePie but Bangladeshi) has tried REAPEATDLY to upload videos on youtube informing people about where protests will take place, each time the videos get taken down. He attempted live streaming the video in 3 places at once, still got taken down.[Right now he's urging people NOT to protest anymore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUPMXCy63Cw) due the sheer violence and regard for their safety.

My freinds in Bangladesh are having their facebook posts removed, some are even being blocked and banned. HOW CAN FACBEOOK bend to GOVERNMENTS like this?

I don't know if the people in my country have access to internet or not right now. Websites reporting on this from Bangladesh are so slow right now I can't acess them. Someone please try accessing https://www.dhakatribune.com/ I can't.

I am in Singapore right now so I am able to access the internet just fine but I can't seem to contact any of my friends and families back home. It seems the government has cut off internet access to deter protest of an entire country. This is horrifying, this can not be acceptable in the modern world. They are doing this so that international media can not get a hold of the horror coming out of Bangladesh.

#Please, let the world know, because right now nothing is coming out of Bangladesh. We are silently being killed.


Our voices are being actively silenced. We need your help, whoever is reading, just know that this is going on, please let the world know about this , that young children are being mercilessly killed

All we wanted as teenagers was for people to obey some fucking traffic laws, and this is what happens.
