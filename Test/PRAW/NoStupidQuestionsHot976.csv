[BBC Story](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-49330848)

>[Hong Kong's] airport, one of the world's busiest, has been the site of daily protests since Friday. It has become the latest focus of mass political unrest in Hong Kong that began 10 weeks ago and shows no signs of abating.

>The wider anti-government protests started in June in response to a proposed extradition bill, which has now been suspended, but have evolved into a more demanding pro-democracy movement. They are being fuelled by fears that the freedoms Hong Kong enjoys as a special administrative region of China are being eroded.

"Incest is Bad, but How did Human... or any other species for that matter have a large enough initial population to ensure diversity?",9193,dq2imu,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/dq2imu/incest_is_bad_but_how_did_human_or_any_other/,795,1572633840.0,"So, this is kind of getting into Adam and Eve territory but...

We all know how inbreeding can cause a lot of issues such as genetic deformation.  What I couldn't figure out is that how do we have enough of a population to begin with to ensure that genetic deformation is not going to ruin humanity or any other species at the very beginning?

I mean, there's 7 billion of us right now.  But how is that possible given that we didn't have 7 billion combinations to start with?  And also, movies like Snowpiercer or ""Human, Space, Time and Human"" where basically 1 pair of breeding human are left, humanity is essentially boned right?

I mean, the pair can make some offsprings, but there's no escaping inbreeding at some point... and with genetic deformation and all that... humanity will end anyways just with time progression?

(like with Chicken and Egg question... I don't know how much egg or chicken we had to start with, but it can't possibly create diversity from just 2 combinations right?)

\-------------

Edit: 11/2

So I've read most of the replies.  And it seems to me that 2 solid conclusions can be made:

1: Humanity actually is not as diverse genetically as I previously thought.  As someone pointed out at some point, how our entire 7 billion is less genetically diverse than 2 groups of chimps in relatively close proximity.  Since, I don't know how much proto human we have, someone said just a few thousand at the lowest point, but given how it's only been like 20 thousand years since near the end of the last ice age, I don't think there's enough time to stretch true genetic diversity from few thousands to 7 billions.  Hence... how we are all just 30th cousins from one another.

2: So it's possible to continue humanity with just 1 pair of breeding human.  It's just that, along the way, you will lose A LOT of offsprings (some people cited 40% deformities that would get eliminated as humanity build itself backup?)  So it becomes more of a number's game.  You need enough offsprings having enough children to offset the 40% loss.

.....

Extra thought: so in one of the replies, I raised story about Trex Ohio not mating with Trex Mississippi.  Obvious mass extinction did happen.  Maybe in this particular case, genetic diversity extinction wouldn't be valid.  But I think Megalodon extinction due to lack of genetic diversity is more probable, right?  I can't imagine giants like Megalodon being so prevalent as it's the top of the food chain.  So it's entirely possible that with changing climates, food, evolutionary competitions, it simply did not have enough population to offset the 40% loss.  In my mind, 40% is only winnable as a guarantee if you have infinite source.  Like in casinos.  Even if you have 60% chance of winning, there's still a high probability that you will lose everything from a bad beat.  A bank with infinite money is the only guaranteed way to take advantage of 60% win rate.

So... humans with the ability to reproduce every 9 months for up to 4 babies each time has much better odds than megalodons to offset the 40% loss.  Sounds plausible?

\----------

Edit 2:  I knew there are more than 1 breeding human at the very beginning when we were still somewhere in Africa.  The Adam and Eve is more of a metaphor as to how there were such a relatively small amount of initial population compared to what we have now in just a relatively short span of time in evolutionary biology.  It's quite incredible actually.  

The 1 breeding pair scenario is more of a situation that came up during those South Korean movies.  Those Koreans really love their bible references.  (watch the space time human one.  It's so trippy.  Although the ending is so unsatisfying, as the end didn't depict the continuation of the mother and son, thus avoiding making judgement of the Adam and Eve scenario... kind of a cop out.)",9193

Student loan debt is becoming an economic crisis while universities show no desire to lower their tuition.

I've read that universities raise their tuition because they want to increase their rankings. Okay, but why?

Do they want to increase their rankings just so that more people will matriculate, pay tuition, and give alumni donations for the rest of their lives?

If that's not the reason, what is?

I've read that universities cost a lot of money to maintain, so they need lots of donations too. Understandable, but do they need to spend as much as they do?

I constantly hear about universities constructing new buildings—to house more students (thus get more tuition) and to build state of the art facilities.

When people can get free education online that's equal or better to what the university offers, what is the point of spending tons of money on fancy new facilities? From what I've read, universities do it to (1) increase their rankings and (2) attract more students.

It all boils down to collecting as much money as possible. But why?

A friend of mine I met in college a few months ago just left with 2 of my roommates & their girlfriends for a house party. My friend's considering getting completely blasted but may moderate herself, I on the otherhand am not going because I have a strong disinterest in alcohol, I'm super introverted and don't do well in large social situations, and just don't care to see drunk people be stupid. My friend's a little upset I'm not going but understands that I wouldn't have a good time.

Now, my friend just got out of a relationship but her and her ex talked for a long time yesterday about what went wrong, but she told him she can't trust him until he proves he can be trusted. As such, she's not looking to be in a relationship right now and I can respect that. But she's a very touchy person, we cuddled for a bit, one thing led to the next and I kissed her before they left for the party.

This is gonna sound real sad but I've never been in a relationship in my 19 years alive and this was my first kiss. Before she left she said she can appreciate being friends with benefits as we were cuddling beforehand and that's fine by me. But since I have little experience around drunk people and they're all coming back to my apartment tonight (no one is driving, don't worry) I REALLY don't wanna do something stupid. Hell she basically had to tell me to kiss her cuz I didn't wanna fuck up.

How do I go about this without any major fuckups? I'm like 100% sure she's not gonna ask for sex and I'm 100% ready to say no because I'm not gonna be the guy accused of rape because she was so far gone.

Update that occured literally while I was writing this post: they all came back an hour later after their ""pre-party"", one of my roommates was completely gone and his girlfriend seemed perfectly sober, my other roommate can drink gallons before anything happens, and my friend (who they said had half a drink) was giggly out of her mind.

How about little details like the stars on the US flag or the kufic calligraphy on the Iranian flag?

And what about flags with elaborate coats of arms like Portugal, or really complex shapes like the Welsh flag?

I need legal advice,1,dqdpz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/dqdpz6/i_need_legal_advice/,3,1572687003.0,"Okay so I originally posted this on r/legaladvice but a moderator removed it because I was asking for a referral apparently. But here goes nothing.

 

Okay so this is going to be a super long and convoluted story. I in the past, and on a different account made a post like this but it didn't really help me much, all I got was ""google it"" and shit like that.

I'm male, 21 years old, I live in New Hampshire USA, I have autism and ADHD and I live with my mother (59 years old).

We both are on disability (I'm on SSI, and I THINK she is too I don't know). She has all my SSI every month (about $750) direct deposited into her account. It goes to necessities and I have no say in any of it. I can't even have any to spend my way.

My mother has legal guardianship over me, basically 2 years ago she stretched the truth to a judge, by exaggerating the severity of my issues, or bringing up past issues which were now solved. She was only granted legal guardianship on the spot because I agreed to let her because she literally hounded me for days before the court hearing to take her side and I really didn't wanna go against my own mother in court. Its been almost 2 years and she's constantly invading my privacy, rummaging through my room while I'm away and berating me for swearing, and sometimes berating me because I am gay (this last one used to be VERY frequent in my teenage years because I only came out at 15 and she's ""religious"").

I had a job but a month ago lost it because of some bullshit drama unrelated to this story. I can easily get a new job, but don't exactly have to with my SSI/disability I get every month. I have a friend who's grandfather is willing to rent me a room long term, they're a very nice family and own a large house.

I have a social worker who I'm not entirely sure of what organization, but she basically hired them to teach me to be an ""adult"", which I already am capable of doing. She's using that social worker to keep me here longer.

My mother is completely reliant on me for income, she cannot work any physical labor and refuses to get a desk job. More than half her income each month comes from my SSI/disability, which I again have no say in where it goes, and often times she ends up overdrawing her account by hundreds of dollars each month.

I do not know where/who/what to do/go to, I want this legal guardianship dissolved, I want control over my SSI/disability, and I want the ability to move out so I can do my own thing. My mother knows how to play the system, she has before and will again. I can take care of myself physically and mentally I am capable, I just am not the best with legal bullshit like this. My mother will try to lie her way into keeping me, I do not want her to keep me around.

My mother is an emotional wreck most of the time, she has been abused most of her life and shunned by the family and her 3 other kids who cut her from their lives for obvious reasons. And while I don't wish to completely cut ties with her, I just REALLY need a place to live other than my with my mother. She's sometimes suicidal, in the past she's threatened to kill herself, she's also threatened me with physical harm, and slapped me across the face on several occasions, one of which times I did it back, but not as hard, and she called the police and told them I punched her (again, she knows how to play the system). I do NOT feel safe living with her, its not that I'm worried about her physically abusing me, its moreso she constantly gets into shouting matches with me and I hate it. I just want a peaceful place to live. I do love my mother, but I don't want to be dependent on her, and definitely do NOT like her being dependent on me for income alone. I have a feeling she's clinging to me tightly because I'm the only one of her kids that hasn't told her to fuck off yet.

Can someone PLEASE help me get in contact with a lawyer or someone who can teach me, or help me to get this legal guardianship dissolved? I really think she's using emotional/mental grooming or something to make me feel pity for her and not want to leave her and that makes me really uncomfortable.",1

I Need Some Answers From Strangers!,2,dq9obm,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/dq9obm/i_need_some_answers_from_strangers/,8,1572667977.0,"I'm really trying to improve my life, one of the many ways I'm trying to do this is by helping other people and doing nice things for other people. I think this would be a very important skill for me because I want to become a psychologist. What are some good things I could do for people? I know this question may seem silly, but since there are so many potential answers to the question, I feel overwhelmed and have a hard time generating good ideas. Also, no answer is too large or small. It can be as simple as picking up a piece of candy that a toddler dropped, or as large scale as volunteering at an elderly home or something. I hope this question doesn't come off as trivial or silly, because I ask this very genuinely. Use your own personal experiences when answering too if it helps you think of anything. Also, I would prefer the good deeds to be for strangers rather than my family and friends as weird as that may seem. I feel like an act of kindness coming from a stranger is usually more meaningful to people than act of kindness from a friend or family member considering that it is an expectation that people like that will do nice things for you. Oh yeah, I know I'm kind of rambling at this point, but winter is right around the corner so some things I've thought about would be shoveling people's driveways and walking their pets in the cold so they don't have to. If you can think of anything though please give me some ideas, and thank you very much for your to read this and respond if you chose to respond. <3",2

Voice calls however are so bad because they rely on old but reliable technology. The same tech used to relay traditional text messages. My question is why not have VOIP be the default and traditional calls serve as backup and make that the industry standard?

I want a safespace somewhere. But what if that's gonna radicalise me in some way? What if i become ignorant? What if I start to label people in my life and i forget that even different political opinion than mine can be based on good arguments, make sense in the context of that person's life and it simply doesnt indicate if they are good or bad?

I've tried ignoring the feeling, but it doesn't work. It's the only thing I can think about, and then I have a difficulty in concentrating. I think this feeling has gotten worse. One night at around 2 AM I woke up, and kind of involuntarily opened my cupboard (which was locked) to make sure my cap was still there, even though there was no way it could have come out. 

I'm not sure if this is related, but sometimes at night I dream about doing some military activity. The activity I dreamed about involved me using my bag.

So about 5 days ago my friend bought a cup of pomegranate seeds and forgot all about it. 

On day 1 she noticed that it was bubbling slightly. The lid was still on and there was no noticeable extra gas produced.

On day 2 she noticed there were even more bubbles, so she ripped off the lid and immediately smelled alcohol. 

On day 3 she noticed that the bubbles had become even more bubbly, and the seeds were rapidly turning into liquid. It smelled like alcohol and did not smell rotten at all. She decided to taste a little bit (idk why she thought it was a good idea) and it tasted sweet and alcohol-y. Not rotten at all. In fact they are still their original colour.

On day 4 she saw a layer of something on top of it which she doesn't know the identity of.

Today, day 5, the bubbles are furious and the alcohol smell seems to have amplified exponentially.

Throughout this whole crazy involuntary experiment she did not keep it in the fridge but at her office desk. 

Is it possible that it was fermenting? If so, why doesn't it rot like other fruits? Why was it fermenting, if she didn't add any yeast to it? We are both very intrigued by it. 

She posted some pics on her insta. I can screenshot and post them if you need to know what it looks like.",2

Do architects also design smaller, dull things to make money? Are their contracts much longer than I’m thinking so that they only need a few in a year to survive? It just seems like a very niche career option that doesn’t require many architects to fill the need.

I had a urge to look at current music albums that are popular. There were a lot of Rap at the top with one Pop album somewhere in there as well.

I decided to listen to a few of the albums and lot of them seem to just repeat the same words over and over again while others I somewhat enjoyed. However, I seem to struggle with how the repetitive ones do so well! They just repeat the same words over and over without much variation. Yet, they are extremely popular. Of the ones I didn't enjoy relied on seemingly trying to say every vulgar thing in the book without much else. Is it because it seems edgy? Appealing to the demographic that listens to it? I understand that music is reliant on each person's preference....but what makes repetitive rap more appealing then other rap?

Can anyone shed some light on this for me?",1

For example anyone right now can buy up thermite, gunpowder, etc in relatively large quantities on AMAZON. Amazon.com, people. Shouldn’t similar chemicals that are capable of explosive destruction (once concocted in a specific way) also be banned?

This doesn’t mean that all civilians in the world won’t have access to it, but at least domestically they will have a much harder time obtaining it, as it would be illegal. Right now anyone can walk into any store selling it or even stay in their home and have it delivered to them with expedited shipping. 

The only negative effect I could see this having is that detonating buildings will no longer be an option, instead, they’d have to resort to manually demolishing the building/structure. And maybe some science teachers wouldn’t be able to conduct an experiment or two. But isn’t it worth saving lives, potentially people you live with who are commuting to work or on their way to a grocery store? 

Im asking because a year or two ago a chemistry student in my city in Poland detonated a homemade bomb on a city bus; lucky, the chemistry student didn’t calculate the correct ratio of chemicals so the explosion was minor and nobody died, however it could have been horrifically fatal if just re-did his math and fixed the amount of chemicals in his bomb.

He was able to buy these chemicals just as anyone could. And obviously suicide bombers from the Middle East are not brining their thermite on airplanes to Europe, so they’re getting their supplies while in the country they plan on setting the bomb off,  meaning domestically. Won’t banning these chemicals from purchase by civilians solve half our problems? Maybe not guns but definitely explosives and IEDs, which are the easiest way to kill
multiple people within seconds (as opposed to shootings and firearm-related killings which at least give people a hope of evacuating an area—a hope that’s non existent with explosives due to their spontaneous nature and maximal fatality rate in milliseconds).",1

How do I start playing my PS4 with ease - speaking as a newly-rich 30+ year old who never played one,0,dq6jml,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/dq6jml/how_do_i_start_playing_my_ps4_with_ease_speaking/,9,1572654288.0,"Hi, I am 30+ years old and I never had much money on me until recently when I could start spending some of what I had saved on luxuries. One of the things I always wanted to do as a kid was to own a nice video game console - but as I said, there were other priorities when you are wise with limited money. 

Around a year back I finally had enough savings on me to get a PS4. I searched for the most popular games, and saw that a game called Witcher 3 was popular, so bought that along with it. It took me a few more months to get a TV, stupid I know, but I really wanted to buy the PS4 while I could. Now I got the TV and the console hooked up, and I realized I was really bad at controlling the game. The character did not do what I wanted him to do, I was getting the camera angles messed up, and in a battle I could hardly make it through the easiest of the opponents. Also I am terribly lost in the map right now, and do not know how to get back on track, and how to progress. 

A lot of it is also because I am not familiar with the console - I see in menu options that I need to press R3 or L3 - and I don't seem to find it till I take a breather to remember and find it.

All this is making the whole process more work than entertainment. I have watched some YouTube videos - some have helped me get through the game but I cannot get past the main hurdle of playing smoothly.

I do not know if this is the right sub for this, but figured I start here because it certainly is among the friendliest.

Why am I at a normal weight?,2,dq20o8,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/dq20o8/why_am_i_at_a_normal_weight/,11,1572630292.0,"&#x200B;

This seems like an odd question. But people keep questioning why I'm at a normal weight and I've wondered myself because based on what I eat, I should be overweight. As in I'm not skinny, just at a normal BMI of 25/26, and I could afford to lose a kilo or 2. I was a bit overweight at 12 because I stress ate a lot.

My whole family except my grandma, me and my brother, are fat. My mother has diabetes, PCOS and hypertension and I inherited the body type and PCOS from her. My parents' weight has gotten slightly better because they're following a fasting/keto diet. My father tells me I'm at a normal weight due to metabolism/genetics. But if that were the case, then I (and my brother) would be genetic miracles.

So why am I at a normal weight when the best my parents can be is overweight? Well I generally accept it that my mother's body and metabolism is fucked up because of diabetes and PCOS, plus the many medications that she takes. This is all while she does all the housework and makes sure to walk at least an hour a day. Ironically her weight was worse when she was young and she lost weight as she got older and learned how her body worked/got better medication. My father spends long hours working and doesn't walk much because he doesn't have much time. He's kept his weight sort of under control with a keto diet and fasting. My brother is a gym junkie and is also on a sort of keto diet. Enough said.

Pretty much everyone in my family is a tiny bit jealous of me, and tell me I'm at a normal weight because of my metabolism or genes (based on what I eat). I'm sure it doesn't solely have to do with what I eat, I do walk quite a to just get to places. My eating schedual is not existant and I just eat when I'm hungry, and because of this I skip meals but also snack a lot. But I also eat quite a lot of fat and sugar, more than is recommended by health experts, with not many fruit and veg in sight.

So tell me, why am I not fat?",2

Edit 2, the idea: It is an idea would appeal to an admittedly small niche mainly, but also to a much much larger one overall. Basically, it involves emissions testing for personal use vehicles. In some states car owners are required to have emissions tests done on their cars with varying degrees of complexity. I feel that these, in general, are a good thing, as someone who is passionate about the environment/outdoors and limiting our impact on it in reasonable ways. However, as a car enthusiast, it is somewhat of a hinderance on that passion in terms of available modifications that can be performed if you live in certain states. I propose a “best of both worlds” solution. Most people that have recreational performance cars do not drive them daily, or even close to daily. In my Corvette z06 that I recently sold, I accumulated about 7k miles in a little over 3 years, driving mostly to the race track and to various car shows, meets, etc. some people that live in other states (like the one I plan to move to) would have to trailer that car to the race track and would be unable to take it to car shows because it would not have passed the sniffer with the modifications that I installed on it. I feel that all states should adopt an emissions test of some kind for all vehicles that are “daily drivers”, but that recreational use vehicles that a driven less than let’s say 4K miles/year should be exempt from these tests in all states (mileage verified and recorded with VIN number at time of registration annually, possibly even performed at emissions centers). This would capture more vehicles not being tested in states that currently don’t have emissions standards, and give more freedom to enthusiasts in states that currently have strict emissions standards. The net effect would be way more cars tested and less enthusiasts working around and cheating the system in places where it is strict.",0

Mathematical equations would be welcomed too. Also answers that might describe characteristics of everything. For example I've also heard a theory that states if it happens once, it happens infinite times, therefore everything is *prolific*. 

Another theory states that in a perfectly balanced system of opposites, the slightest of imbalance leads to the creation of all things. And bc of the nature of opposites, as long as you have balance, you will also have imbalance. This would imply that everything is constantly being created. One could then imply that everything is *genesis*. 

In both simulation theory and religion there is another theory stating that everything is *beliefs*. In simulation theory a computer creates reality, but that reality must be believable, therefore everything is based on beliefs. And in religion beliefs are everything.

There is also the idea that everything is whatever you believe it is. So I'll leave you with this quick verse I came up with...

""One day God and Heraclitus were debating about what everything is. God said 'everything is beliefs.' Heraclitus said everything is comprised of opposites. Then God said, 'is that what you believe?'""",1

Is this how life is supposed to feel or am I just being a baby?,2,dq04nr,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/dq04nr/is_this_how_life_is_supposed_to_feel_or_am_i_just/,21,1572615742.0,"So this is going to be a long one, but here it is:

Hi Reddit.... I am a 17 year old M, who is wondering about a question I have quite been to get an answer too.

Now, I am in 12 grade (My senior year) but I live in an apartment separate from my parents. I take myself to school everyday, on a bike, and I have been doing this for a good 2 and 1/2 years or so. It takes me about 15 minutes to ride to school, and 15 back. Usually, I take initiative in my academics. I get good grades, I attend all of my classes, and I have never gotten into major trouble. I have done this so consistently that ON my senior year my parents gave me the option to live completely by myself under their finical aid (which means I had to get a job in my senior year which I work on after school) IN addition, I also signed up for some college classes and made it onto my school's basketball team, leaving me with at least 3 hours of practice every Tuesday and Thursday. Now, all after everything is accounted for, it leaves very little time for relaxation and downtime... I often find myself struggling... Struggling so much, that I broke up with my girlfriend because I felt that I was  not spending enough time talking with her.

Now, the closer it gets to wintertime, and the more work some of my college classes require, the worse I seem to be doing. Firstly, I'm having trouble sleeping at nighttime, and when I do sleep, my dreams are filled with nightmares and real life scenarios that never seem to make sense. IN the dream I always feel lost, and alone. 

Because of my sleep deprecation, I find myself consistently shutting off my alarm clock which is something I usually don't end up remembering. I'm missing classes and easily pulling in 12-14 hours of sleep before finally feeling satisfied enough to actually get out of bed. I don't want to go to school. I don't want to go to work, and most of all, I don't want to finish my homework. 

I've honestly lost interest in most things I enjoy. Basketball seems like a chore, eating seems like a chore, socializing seems like a chore. Everything just seems tougher and I'd rather just sit in bed and watch the shadows scrap across the walls. The only thing I seem to enjoy, is listening to songs that fit my mood, which is a constant down in the dumps.

Not to mention, I seem to be drifting away from my friends at school; I feel like I'm doing something wrong, or saying things that might upset them.  I feel they'd be better off without me. 

And worst of all, I find myself imagining scenarios where I'm suffering or hurting. I'd almost feels like I deserve to be hurt because I'm becoming such a crappy person. 

So... Reddit.  Here's my question? Is what I am experiencing something that is Normal when transition to adulthood? Am I being too sensitive with emotions and letting them get the best of me? Or is something else wrong?

And to you u/Lilypad2305 The only thing I regret between us, is not being there for you, even when you needed it the most. I'm sorry.

&#x200B;

tl;dr After going into 12 grade I got slammed with reality and didn't take it like a champ. I'm wondering if it is normal; if all  young adults experience something like this, or if it's something different.",2

Recently I learned that Jeff Bezos is the owner of the Washington Post which is a rather left leaning source of media (correct me if Im wrong).

So, as the owner I guess that he somehow identifies with what is published there.

As the WP articles are nearly always about pro democratic agendas (f.e. Social justice, loans, employees and their low income) I was wondering if Bezos himself supports those agendas as he himself is heavily critized and held responsible for everything that goes wrong with Amazon (income, environment etc.).

Does he basically support Politics that would decrease the financal power of his own businesses?

"How can I stop feeling depressed because of other people's opinion? I feel bad being a NEET, even though I have the greatest time of my life. I got a problem to solve because now in a week I have to answer it in honest.",0,dq139y,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/dq139y/how_can_i_stop_feeling_depressed_because_of_other/,10,1572623078.0,"Basically I always felt unhappy faking it in school that I am interested at all. It made me depressed pretending to be happy or interested, when in secret I was wasting my time for more than 8 hours a day in school.

So last Monday, I quit. Not because of the past experience, but as the teacher set an even stricter rule set of sick days and a few other things I couldn't look away at anymore. I was basically a non-paid slave in that sense. 

Now I've become unemployed or more like of a NEET. But I always felt bad being a Neet. People in Africa need that money more. It is crazy because I realize there are rich people out there, that have the same relationship to folks like us, just that they don't even think about it how good they have it, usually. 

So I live in Germany and there's this social walfare system called ""Hartz IV"". People having it are very shunned by outsiders. 

The thing is in 1 week I have an interview with an adviser for an apprenticeship.

The thing is: I look around in my environment and even the basic job looks hard to me, or rather, impossible. It says I have to be friendly no matter what (which I am just not to rude customers), customer orientated, a team player, passionate, etc. which simply I am not. And I am rather slow (which I can't do just faster).

I feel like I don't really fit into  your normal job. All skills I've gained are in video games or language related (rhetoric, the language itself), etc.

Neither do I really have fun in subjects outside what I currently do. Math was interesting at first, until things were introduced like linear functions. German was never interesting, they keep analyzing short poems out of world war 2 which was just filled with despair. Sports just kept going with either very annoying stretching out tasks or had very basic games of popular sports games such as basketball, where the strongest simply dominated because they were the only one that were kinda experienced as they played outside the school. It was boring. 

I know that I probably will be pretty much long-term unemployed, but I just feel bad about it. And I know why.

I'm way too sensitive about the opinions of others. I feel bad playing video games or watching Anime, because it was said it is time wasting - even though I have the greatest time of my life in it.

How can I ignore the opinions of others?",0

Why aren't we planting 1 trillion trees to combat climate change?,2,dpz4g8,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/dpz4g8/why_arent_we_planting_1_trillion_trees_to_combat/,12,1572609257.0,"The 20 million trees thing got me thinking - of all the ways to combat climate change, planting trees is one of the seemingly most straightforward. It's relatively cheap (trees cost between $2 and $20 to plant though I assume those numbers would be lower if done en masse) and a very known, safe way to counter climate change. So what's stopping us from doing so? 

I realise that 1 trillion is a very big number (one million million) but given that we know that climate change will mess us up for hundreds of years it seems like a very small price to pay. When you break it down by country it seems very reasonable.",2
