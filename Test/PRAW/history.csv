In light of the ""on all sides"" rhetoric I found this to be a poignant reminder of how people on opposing sides (literally, Hitler) could come together.

I never had a chance to meet Pop, but from what I'm told he was a gentleman and a scholar who was even more popular with the ladies than he was with the Nazis.

* He was a Lifemaster of Bridge.

>Children began to be the tyrants, not the slaves, of their households.

They tyrannised over the paidagogoi and schoolmasters.

I find that even among the splendid pieces of furniture built by our master cabinetmakers, those in the old forms are the most pleasing. And as for writing letters, surviving scraps from the past reveal how superb the phrasing used to be. The ordinary spoken language has also steadily coarsened.

>We remarked with pain that the indecent foreign dance called the Waltz was introduced (we believe for the first time) at the English court on Friday last … it is quite sufficient to cast one's eyes on the voluptuous intertwining of the limbs and close compressor on the bodies in their dance, to see that it is indeed far removed from the modest reserve which has hitherto been considered distinctive of English females. So long as this obscene display was confined to prostitutes and adulteresses, we did not think it deserving of notice; but now that it is attempted to be forced on the respectable classes of society by the civil examples of their superiors, we feel it a duty to warn every parent against exposing his daughter to so fatal a contagion.

>A pernicious excitement to learn and play chess has spread all over the country, and numerous clubs for practicing this game have been formed in cities and villages...chess is a mere amusement of a very inferior character, which robs the mind of valuable time that might be devoted to nobler acquirements, while it affords no benefit whatever to the body. Chess has acquired a high reputation as being a means to discipline the mind, but persons engaged in sedentary occupations should never practice this cheerless game; they require out-door exercises--not this sort of mental gladiatorship.

>“*‘We want to get married, but there is nowhere we can set up a house of our own. It is either a case of waiting goodness knows how long, and we've waited all the war, or, going to live with Mary's mother.’* How often is a similar remark heard in those days, for it is the problem that young people all over the country have to face. Thousands of young fellows have come home from the war intent on setting up a home with the girl of their heart only to find that there are no homes to be had… Many men, of course, have not waited for houses, but have got married and gone into rooms or to live with relatives, but neither course can be considered very satisfactory.”

>Never has youth been exposed to such dangers of both perversion and arrest as in our own land and day. Increasing urban life with its temptations, prematurities, sedentary occupations, and passive stimuli just when an active life is most needed, early emancipation and a lessening sense for both duty and discipline, the haste to know and do all befitting man's estate before its time, the mad rush for sudden wealth and the reckless fashions set by its gilded youth--all these lack some of the regulatives they still have in older lands with more conservative conditions.

>...[The screen artists'] beauty, their exquisite clothing, their lax habits and low moral standards, are becoming unconsciously appropriated by the plastic minds of American youth. Let them do what they may; divorce scandals, hotel episodes, free love, all are passed over and condoned by the young... The eye-gate is the widest and most easily accessible of all the avenues of the soul; whatever is portrayed on the screen is imprinted indelibly upon the nation's soul.

>The bad manners of all parliaments, the general tendency to connive at a rather shady business transaction if it promises to bring in money without work, jazz and Negro dances as the spiritual outlet in all circles of society, women painted like prostitutes, the efforts of writers to win popularity by ridiculing...the correctness of well-bred people, and the bad taste shown even by the nobility and old princely families in throwing off every kind of social restraint and time-honoured custom: all of these go to prove that it is now the vulgar mob that gives the tone.

They think very much like ourselves only their expression of their thinking is a little bit different.’*”

their elders; how they are to show respect to them by standing and
making them sit; what honour is due to parents; what garments or shoes

2. >And though
only the best of them will be appointed by their predecessors, still
they will be unworthy to hold their fathers' places, and when they

care of us, the Muses, first by under-valuing music; which neglect
will soon extend to gymnastic; and hence the young men of your State
will be less cultivated.

I figured I might as well post it here in case anyone else found it interesting.

1784 was about as far back as I could consistently find images for each year that were significantly different from year to year, and after 1970 fashion became a lot more diverse and harder to summarize in one picture, so I started/ ended it there. 

It's all western fashion and tends towards stuff wealthier women would have worn, particularly pre-20th century. Most of the illustrations are from fashion plates, magazines, and sewing patterns from the year stated.

"With the surprising number of commenters in various subreddits that continue to confidently assert that the Holocaust is a hoax, it’s worth reviewing the prosecution and conviction of Adolf Eichmann.",22374,8gh2ju,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/8gh2ju/with_the_surprising_number_of_commenters_in/,1191,1525293496.0,"On May 11 1960, Adolf Eichmann, a Nazi Lieutenant Colonel and one of the primary logistical facilitators of the Holocaust, was captured by Israeli agents in Argentina where he had fled to avoid capture and prosecution. His trial in Israel was attended by journalists from major newspapers worldwide and tapes of the coverage were flown daily to the United States where they were made available for broadcast nationally. Eichmann was not found guilty of all charges, but enough of the most severe charges were deemed sufficient to sentence him to death by hanging. Eichmann’s defense team appealed to the Supreme Court, but the appeal was unsuccessful. They then appealed to the president of Israel for clemency. Clemency was actually considered, especially after an emotional appeal from Eichmann’s wife and brothers and many well-respected Jewish statesmen, but ultimately denied. Eichmann was finally hanged on June 1 1962; the hanging itself was witnessed by journalists.

Through these proceedings Eichmann first claimed that he was not at all involved; then, when it was proven conclusively that he was, he insisted that he was just following orders and while he had been present at mass executions he did not arrange them personally. Eichmann’s defense team focused on questioning the admissibility of evidence, for which they were largely successful (hence his not being convicted on all charges).

At no time did Eichmann, his attorneys in their testimony, or his wife or brothers in their appeals, even attempt to suggest that the Holocaust was a hoax.

Think about that. Even if you believe that the entire trial was a sham designed to railroad an innocent man, even if you think that his entire (German and non-Jewish) defense team conspired against him, Eichmann was placed in front of hundreds of reporters and television cameras every day of a four month long trial, and never once did he turn to them and say “the so-called Holocaust never happened and I’m a totally innocent Argentinian,” even though (if there was any validity to his claim) that would have been the simplest way of preventing his own execution. Do you think he was brainwashed somehow into believing he had facilitated the deaths of millions while under arrest and interrogation? They would have also had to somehow brainwash his wife and his brothers, none of whom attempted a “there was no Holocaust” defense in their clemency letters.

In other words, to believe the Holocaust is a hoax is to believe in a conspiracy that involves some combination of all of Israel, a German defense team, hundreds of newspaper reporters from all over the world, a man’s wife and family, and the man himself, all of whom could have publicly denied the Holocaust for millions of newspaper readers and television viewers and chose not to, knowing it would lead to an innocent man’s death.

"My father, a captured World War II resistance fighter and Auschwitz concentration camp survivor, wrote this unpublished, based-on-true-events book about the Nazis, Hitler, and their occupation of Europe during WWII.

He was held captive in Krakow, Bergen-Belsen, before finally being liberated from Auschwitz by the Allied forces. Losing the majority of his family and friends in the camps, he spent most of life trying to forget his experiences, and then, spent the latter years of his life trying to remember them.


He passed away 10 years ago, leaving behind his historical fiction manuscript.  He wasn’t a writer and was not educated past high school due to the war starting; nevertheless, he was smart and hard-working and spent the better part of a decade working on it in the 1980s.  

> DOWNLOAD LINK: https://www.dropbox.com/s/snjamtqi1kiycsc/Oberfuhrer%20Manuscript%20p1.pdf?dl=0

It's about his personal experiences and the personal stories of those he was friends with in the resistance and the concentration camps as told through the eyes of a fictional young, talented Dutch footballer who crosses paths with his pre-war German football rival several years into the War.  The protagonist finds that his rival, now a vindictive and powerful Nazi Commandant, is in-charge of the very Concentration Camp the young Dutchman was sent to, but his arrival there was hardly a coincidence: the German is intent on cruel revenge and the Dutchman must escape or suffer a fate worse than death. It’s a story of true accounts and real people channelled through a fictional story of a personal rivalry between two sporting heroes turned prisoner/captor. 


While the first four chapters serve only to start introductions to the various lead characters and begin to establish their motivations, the plot (which really begins when the protagonist becomes imprisoned in a concentration camp) is a tale of jealously, revenge and clever escape with themes that include youthful exuberance, love, conspiracy, world sports, Hitler, political intrigue, revenge, torture and deceit; all set in a global climate of rising Fascism, intolerance and corrupt officials. 


This manuscript is easy-to-read, compelling, and tells an exciting story. Even though I was only 12 years old when he completed it, I know the manuscript generated quite a bit of interest in Hollywood for a few years around the time he completed it, and that Willem Dafoe (actor) and Mervyn LeRoy (director) were personally championing the project, but partly due to LeRoy's untimely death, it was never made into a film.  That was thirty years ago.


My wife and I have spent time trying to get it published on our own, but as a reserved and shy couple that doesn’t spend much time “online,” our results have been mostly lacklustre.  But, we still believe that it can get published traditionally as my father had wished. While this is rather uncomfortable for us, we decided to see if social media can help bring us closer to the right people.


Linked is a pdf^[1] with the first 4 chapters of the manuscript to find an interested publisher for this book. We're not sure how many unpublished books-of-quality there are by actual Holocaust Survivors left in the world, so we decided to start sharing my father's work with kind people via Reddit, hopeful that a good person can help get his story out there.

I  married an Austrian a few years ago. I've always heard her grandfather was involved in WW2 and an amateur photographer throughout, but her family are not very forthcoming with information. He was a Nazi accountant 1938-1945 (ein Buchhalter) from the city of Graz in southern Austria and for some time was based in France.

This Christmas we spent at her family's house in Graz so I went on a search for those old photos I heard about. In a derelict cellar, battling cobwebs I eventually found 2 very dusty albums...Probably about 150 photos.

I don't really have a lot more information. A lot of the photos have some writing on the back. My German is good but it's very difficult to read the writing. I can post the writing for any individual photo if some of the reddit historian detectives think they can help.

In the dead of the night a noise, resembling the clashing of iron, was frequently heard, which, if you listened more attentively, sounded like the rattling of chains, distant at first, but approaching nearer by degrees: immediately afterwards a spectre appeared in the form of an old man, of extremely emaciated and squalid appearance, with a long beard and dishevelled, hair, rattling the chains on his feet and hands. The distressed occupants meanwhile passed their wakeful nights under the most dreadful terrors imaginable. This, as it broke their rest, ruined their health, and brought on distempers, their terror grew upon them, and death ensued. Even in the daytime, though the spirit did not appear, yet the impression remained so strong upon their imaginations that it still seemed before their eyes, and kept them in perpetual alarm. Consequently the house was at length deserted, as being deemed absolutely uninhabitable; so that it was now entirely abandoned to the ghost.""

He then goes on to write about how the City of Athens posted a warning to future buyers, but a stranger to Athens bought it because of the extremely low price. The buyer did experience everything he was warned about and even saw the ghost itself. It led him to a certain spot in the house and then vanished. The next day he asked the lawmakers of Athens for permission to dig up that spot. 

He then says, ""the skeleton of a man in chains was found there; for the body, having lain a considerable time in the ground, was putrefied and mouldered away from the fetters. The bones, being collected together, were publicly buried, and thus after the ghost was appeased by the proper ceremonies, the house was haunted no more.""",2018-10-13 21:05:41

I am curious as to how burrying 200,000 men alive was accomplished. (asuming it was against their will) and how a rebel army of 130,000 ended the first imperial dynasty of China, by defeating an army of 500,000  Any information would be much appreciated. 

Edit: I never imagined this post being viewed a quarter million times. I enjoy reading all the comments. A common and understandable thread is disbelief,  but it appears to me that this event did in fact happen. Of course the numbers are questionable, but consider the possibilities in light of information from some commenters knowledgeable of the era and subject. The Qin dynasty (with a population of around 40 million, comparable to the napoleonic empire 2,000 years later) practiced universal conscription, meaning every adult male could be drafted and every adult could be mobilized for state projects. ""Fielding one million men for the Qin was certainly possible"" writes Charles Holcombe, so the size of the army was not out of question. In 1912, workers on the Longhai Railway in Henan, (where the burial is said to have occured) discovered burial pits containing human remains. This area was known by locals as the ""million people pit"" and was reported to be 400 meters long and 250 meters wide. Certainly big enough for the 200,000 reported, although many think the number was much smaller.",2017-08-10 10:38:54

The CIA and the Guatemalan genocide: For the uninformed.,12862,5sf6ns,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/5sf6ns/the_cia_and_the_guatemalan_genocide_for_the/,1207,1486427350.0,"The [Guatemalan genocide (1960-1996, especially 1981-1983)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemalan_genocide), which resulted in the mass murder and death of 170,000 [Maya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_peoples), was a part of the [Guatemalan Civil War (1960-1996)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemalan_Civil_War).

Previously, a CIA mission codenamed ""OPERATION PBSUCCESS"" had deposed the democratically elected leftist government of Guatemala and installed a right-wing, pro-American military junta in its place ([1954 Guatemalan coup d'état](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_Guatemalan_coup_d%27état)). Starting in 1960, leftist guerrilla movements began fighting the military government, and were backed by the Maya people. Then, the Guatemalan military took upon itself the goal of eliminating all socialist guerrillas and supporters, whether real or suspected, which included Maya civilians. The Maya were systematically executed or disappeared, often at the hands of right-wing paramilitary death squads such as [Mano Blanca](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mano_Blanca). Although Mano Blanca was one of the most notorious death squads, described by leading novelist Paul Theroux as ""Guatemala's version of a volunteer Gestapo unit,"" it received aid from the CIA. Many other death squads received aid from both the Guatemalan government and the CIA, primarily in the form of training and armament. 

The US knew about and enabled Guatemalan atrocities. A good example of why the US supported the Guatemalan government anyway  is given in the Wikipedia article on the [Central American crisis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_American_crisis): ""In particular, the United States feared that victory by communist forces would threaten the Panama Canal and would isolate the rest of South America from the United States if the countries of Central America were to be installed with pro-soviet communist governments."" As a result, the CIA, fearful of Soviet influence in Central America becoming similar to Soviet influence in Cuba, chose to turn a blind eye to (and often enable) the Guatemalan genocide. 

Hope you found this enlightening.

The source is listed as a book published in Russia in the 1990s. So although it might be taken with a grain of salt, overall style seems to fit.

""To teacher comrade Martyshin.
I have received your letter about escapades of Vasily Stalin. Thank you for the letter. Replying with a great delay because of being overloaded with work. My apologies. Vasily is a spoiled young man of average abilities, little wildman, not always honest, likes to blackmail weak ""teachers"", not rarely an insolent fellow,  with weak - or more accurately - unorganized willpower.

He was spoiled by various ""god fathers"" and ""god mommies"", who continually emphasize that he is ""Stalin's son"". I am glad that in your person there is at least one self-respecting teacher who treats Vasily as everyone else and demands that the insolent boy follows the school's policy. Vasily is spoiled by principals like the one you mentioned, washcloth-people [means spinless in Rus.], who have no place at school; and if insolent Vasily hasn't destroyed himself yet it is because our country still has teachers who don't give slack to the little young swell.

My advice: demand stricter from Vasily and don't be affraid of fake blackmail threats of ""suicide"" from the capricious child. You will have my support.

Unfortunately I don't have the opportunity to fuss with Vasily myself. But promise to grab him by the collar from time to time.

Cheers!""

Edit: Vasily was born in 1921. So he was 17 in 1938.
Edit 2: comments say that 'washcloth' can be translated as 'wet rag' or 'limp rag'. It does seem to sound better. ",2016-08-24 04:32:22

It's one thing to read about the grand achievements of an emperor, another thing entirely to read the writings of someone the same as you. A normal person, no one of any real significance, a name lost to history. Yet 2000 years later, the stupid shit they wrote on a wall survives. 2000 years and we've barely changed, we're still writing things on walls, whether it be profound, insulting or just plain idiotic. Hell, in a way we're doing it right now. I should not feel deeply connected to long dead vandals but I do. So far apart, yet so alike.

His father wanted him to be a priest, just like he was, however after being bed sick and pleading to his father that he wanted to go to university instead, his father finally gave in and agreed. Wise decision.

Truly one of the most brilliant minds ever to exist. 

We owe him so much, and we still use a majority of his ideas and inventions to this day. All incorporated into modern tools, gadgets, you name it. In return, he did not wish for money, doing alone and broke by the time around his death. He was just another man who wanted to change the world.

I want to check if you guys are interested in a AMA with my grandmother. She survived the Japanese concentration camps in Indonesia during WWII.,12068,4g2v3m,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/4g2v3m/i_want_to_check_if_you_guys_are_interested_in_a/,447,1461433019.0,"Hi all!

Last year I've seen a lot of redditors that let their grandparents have an AMA, mostly about their experiences in WWII, but these stories are always from the Europian/Western side. Although very interesting I've always felt that the Asian side isn't told that much. At least in my case, we Dutchies learn almost nothing about the history and culture of our former colonies like Indonesia. Such imporant things happend there, but people simply don't know anything about them.

My grandmother was born in Indonesia during the '30, so I was lucky she could tell me wonderful stories (relatively, of course) about everything she's experienced. The struggles during the war: being a half-blood she and her entire family ended up in one of the concentration camps during the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies. After that her immigration to the Netherlands: she was kicked out of her homeland and had to move to a new and strange country where they didn't exactly get welcomed, they barely spoke the language of, and had to survive with almost no posessions.

I thought her life-story might give a unique angle on the past and if you guys would find it interesting I could arrange an AMA on /r/IAmA/. Let me hear your thoughts! 

**EDIT:** Wow the response was much greater than I first anticipated, thanks for your feedback! I'll speak with my grandmother about this and I'll arrange the AMA!

**EDIT2:** If people stuble to this edit: the date's been arranged. It will be comming saturday 30-04, probably around our midday. I'm in the process running it through the official channels, whereafter you'll hear about a more exact time!

**EDIT3:** Saturday 30-04-'16 at 13:00 UTC+2, I'll post a link here when it goes live.

"Buried viking ship discovered in Halden, Norway",11823,9oaxfv,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/9oaxfv/buried_viking_ship_discovered_in_halden_norway/,317,1539621911.0,"[Official news of the discovery in norwegian](https://www.ostfoldfk.no/nyheter/vikingskipsfunn-i-ostfold.103691.aspx). I have not been able to find any english language news on this yet, but you can see pictures from the area and the georadar picture of the ship.

&#x200B;

But long story short, by using Ground penetrating radar, archeologists from NIKU (Norwegian institute of heritage research)  have discovered several burial mounds and houses from the viking age, and a buried 20 meter long viking ship, making it one of the biggest ships discovered in Norway. The three viking ships displayed at the Viking Museum in Oslo are the Oseberg, Gokstad and Tune ships, at 21, 23 and 19 meters.

&#x200B;

It has been known for many years that the area has graves, but no one was expecting to find a ship, which will be the first large viking ship discovered in Norway in a hundred years. It is impossible to tell how the condition of the ship will be, until they uncover it.

"On June 6th, 1944, John Ford commanded a film crew on Omaha Beach. Most of the footage was accidentally dropped overboard.",11770,8p5ouo,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/8p5ouo/on_june_6th_1944_john_ford_commanded_a_film_crew/,352,1528358635.0,"During World War II, Hollywood directors such as John Huston and John Ford volunteered for service with the military (Army, and Navy, respectively), where their talents were put to the best use, namely making movies. They, and others, were tasked with creating films for domestic consumption to bring the war home to American audiences, in other words, propaganda. Ford, for instance, shot the film ""Battle of Midway"", during the fight itself, although in part it was sheer luck he was present, the Navy having already sent him there to shoot more tranquil footage. He recalled the irony afterwards that ""*I think at the time there was some report of some action impending but [...] I didn’t think it was going to touch us. So I [...] spent about 12 hours a day in work, had a good time up there.*”

By far most famously though was D-Day. The Allies intended to thoroughly document their triumph there, and several hundred ships were equipped with movie cameras, as were some 50 landing craft, all constantly rolling and not needing human touch. In addition, Ford , along with George Stevens, was given film crews to be sent on in with the troops, part of a documentary force that numbered in the hundreds when you include still photographers (Ford was attached to the Navy and OSS, Stevens to the Army, and coordinated very little). Stevens run shooting at Juno Beach with the British [To clarify, yes, Canadians landed on Juno. Stevens was working off of a Royal Navy ship], while Ford was in charge for Omaha, where the most intense fighting was. He would actually refuse to talk about it for many years after, but did eventually offer his recollections:

>Once I was on the beach I ran forward and started placing some of my men behind things so they’d have a chance to expose their film. I know it doesn’t sound blazingly dramatic. [....] To tell the truth I was too busy doing what I had to do for a cohesive picture of what I did to register in my mind. We stayed on the job and worked that day and for several other days and nights too.

Ironically, for all their efforts, almost none of the footage would see the light of day, for several unfortunate causes. In the first, much of the footage was destroyed, packed into a duffle-bag that was accidentally dropped into the water! As for what little remained, after being processed in London a few days later, at least according to Ford ""[a]pparently the government was afraid to show so many casualties on screen."" The camera crews hadn't held back, and it was simply too real for the people back home, it would seem. It was not entirely lost though. Those familiar with the story from Stephen Ambrose's book on D-Day will likely only know the conclusion at that point, when no one knew where the footage was still, but since that time, some of it was, in fact, rediscovered in US government storage, although just how much remains unclear, and almost none of that has ever been released

As detailed in this 2000 article from [Time](http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,46456,00.html):

>Yet somehow Ford's footage was lost until 1998, when Melvyn R. Paisley, a World War II aviator and Reagan-era Assistant Secretary of the Navy, found a few canisters of the missing film deep within the National Archives. Spielberg, whose father had also served in the U.S. Army Air Corps and who would win the Best Director Oscar for his own D-day movie, Saving Private Ryan, was intrigued when he read about Paisley's find in the New Yorker.

>So intrigued, in fact, that he recruited documentary maker and TIME film critic Richard Schickel and immediately started hunting for more raw footage from World War II. With Paisley's help, they amassed 600 hours' worth and began editing the remarkable trove. The result is Shooting War, a spectacularly conceived and haunting 90-min. documentary that premieres June 5 [2000], in conjunction with the opening of the National D-Day Museum, at a conference sponsored by the Eisenhower Center at the University of New Orleans.

The Shooting War, at least, [is on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAeXGNbxh2I), but it is about war photographers during WWII, not D-Day, so the actual D-Day footage is only a small part. [This is the timestamp for when D-Day starts up](https://youtu.be/ZAeXGNbxh2I?t=524). What parts are actually Ford's team's footage seems to be unclear, as much of it was legitimately lost, Paisley only recovering part of it. [This I think is when it starts](https://youtu.be/VRohPHLHeLI?t=52), as as you can see, it is quite brief, shot by a cameraman who was wounded and evacuatted early on, presumably keeping his footage out of the cursed duffle.

Other D-Day footage of course exists. The aforementioned George Stevens, similarly tasked to run shooting at Juno Beach, also has surviving footage, [some of which is excerpted here for instance.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-two/10861960/World-War-Two-as-you-have-never-seen-it-extremely-rare-colour-footage-of-D-Day-invasion-released.html) But the Omaha footage is almost entirely lost to the ages.

More broadly focused on the Hollywood men who contributed by shooting the war, ""Five Came Back: A Story of Hollywood and the Second World War"" by Mark Harris is a book on the topic, focusing on Ford and Huston, as well as Frank Capra, George Stevens, and William Wyler, who were also involved in the war effort.

Additionally, an extensive interview by Ford was given in 1964 which expands upon the above quotations. He was speaking with Peter Martin, and it was published in The American Legion Magazine, Volume 76, No. 6 (June 1964). Conversely though, Ford's account must be balanced by allegations that his recollections were mostly fabricated. While he certainly was assigned to run the filming, [he may very well have done so while never setting foot on the beach!](https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/truth-or-tall-tales-director-john-fords-dday-account-discredited-20140610-zs1tq.html):

>""How would I describe my job?"" John Ford said, when I asked him. ""Unofficially, I was in charge of cinemaphotography, but in all honesty I was really more or less a logistic officer. It was up to me to see that everybody who should have a camera had one. I take my hat off to my Coast Guard kids. They were impressive. They went in first, not to fight, but to photograph. They went with the troops. They were with the first ones ashore. They filmed some wonderful material. Fortunately, most of them came through well. There were a few casualties. I lost some men. It is a coincidence that one of the cameramen who works for me today — his name is Archie Stout — had a son in my outfit. He was one of the two photographers who rode ashore on a Phoenix concrete breakwater. He rode his Phoenix all the way over from England photographing everything in sight. He did a fine job riding that big box. He got a Silver Star for it. Later, he was to be flown back to England to sign his papers for a commission for which he certainly qualified in every way. On his way, even before he'd left France, a lone German fighter popped out of nowhere and shot him down. He's buried there in a cemetery where the landing was. That cemetery was a new one and Stout's was one of the first graves there. I've been back to it several times to leave flowers. 

>""I think it's amazing that I lost no more, when you consider how much some of them were exposed to fire, although I wouldn't let them stand up. I made them lie behind cover to do their photographing. Nevertheless, they didn't have arms, just cameras, and to me, facing the enemy defenseless takes a special kind of bravery. When a man is armed with a gun he's probably much braver than if he doesn't have one. 

>""In action, I didn't tell my boys where to aim their cameras. They took whatever they could. Once they got ashore they just started photographing our troops in different groups rushing to their assigned places. Not that they rushed wildly, they rushed with a definite purpose. After they got ashore, they made for a certain objective. There was no panic or running around. I've often wondered why they didn't run faster. Probably they weighed too much with all their equipment on. They hurried, but there was no frantic dash, just a steady dogtrot. 

>""I remember meeting Col. Red J. Reeder on the beach. I knew him well and I met him a long time later when I went to West Point to do a picture. The Long Gray Line. On D-Day, Red was sitting with one leg smashed so badly it had to be amputated. 'Got any orange juice?' he asked me. I said, 'Orange juice! What the hell would I be doing carrying orange juice? How- about a shot of brandy?' We had been issued little bottles of brandy in case anybody needed it. Doggedly he said, 'No, I want orange juice.' I said. Colonel, I'm afraid that's something I can't get you, but I can help you get back to our ship which is close in. Once there you can get some aid.' He said, 'No, I just want some orange juice.' Red and I had a laugh about that long afterward at West Point. In a moment of crisis, people get funny fixations. I asked him, 'Why didn't you take that brandy?' He said, i don't know. It's the first time in my life I ever refused a drink of hard liquor. All of a sudden I was pure. As a matter of fact, I don't even like orange juice.' He was in shock, and as I've said, they had to cut off his leg in an emergency operation. 

>""The film my men took was processed in London, in both color and black-and-white. Most of it was in Kodachrome. It was transferred to black-and-white for release in the news weeklies in movie theaters. All of it still exists today in color in storage in Anacostia near Washington, D.C. My cutting unit was in London, too. They worked 24-hour watches, picking out the best part of the film that had been shot. I'm sure it was the biggest cutting job of all time including the cutting done for the recent picture Cleopatra. The cutters worked four-hour shifts — on four, off four. Allen Brown, the producer, now a captain in the Reserve, was in charge. There were literally millions of feet of film. When Brown's unit saw something they liked, they pressed a button, and put clips on that portion of film. When they cut the stuff  all they did was cut at the places marked  by those clips. It saved a lot of time. Very  little was released to the public then —  apparently the Government was afraid  to show so manv American casualties on  the screen. After all. even The New York  Times best-seller list that summer had  only six 'war books' on it out of a total  of 30. 

>""As I've said, I don't think I ever saw  more than a dozen men at one time on  that beach. That's all my eye could take  in. For that matter. I don't think any-  body on the beach saw more than 20 at  the outside. After all. they all were at-  tacking in small groups. They were  trained to do that. The first wave consisted of about 3.000 men. and not all of  them got ashore alive. Numerically, that  wasn't so many really.

The Ancient Greeks had no word to describe the color blue.

The author argues we don’t actually have conclusive evidence the Greeks couldn’t “see” blue; it’s more that they used a different color palette entirely, and also blue was the most difficult dye to manufacture. Even so, we see a curious lack of a term to describe blue in certain other ancient cultures, too. I find this particularly jarring given that blue is seemingly ubiquitous in nature, most prominently in the sky above us for much of the year, depending where you live. 

What are some other examples of seemingly objective concepts that turn out to be highly dependent on language, culture and other, more subjective facets of being human?

During WWII a lot of countries were experimenting with using animals as weapons. One of the great ideas of the U.S. was a cat guided bomb. The basic thought process was that cats always land on their feet, and they hate water. So scientist figured if they put a cat inside a bomb, rig it up to a harness so it can control some flaps on the bomb, and drop the bomb near a ship out in the ocean, the cat's natural fear of water will make it steer the bomb twards the ship. And there you go, cat guided bomb. Now this weapon system never made it past testing (aparently the cats always fell unconcious mid drop) but the fact that someone even had the idea, and that the government went along with this is baffling to me.


Is there a more ridiculous weapon in history that tops this? It can be from any time period, a single weapon or a whole weapon system, effective or ineffective, actually used or just experimental, if its weird and ridiculous I want to hear about it!

I was amazed at all that happened to him and his family.,10493,6rt8kn,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/6rt8kn/i_asked_my_grandfather_about_his_experience_in/,630,1501985014.0,"For some reason asking my Grandfather about his experiences during World War II never really crossed my mind. I am a History/Political Science major in university and the World Wars always fascinated me so when i saw him recently I decided to ask him. Some of his stories were really amazing. 

My Grandfather was 10 years old and living in the Netherlands during World War II. His older brother was enlisted in the war and was taken as a PoW only three years into the war. His other brother was arrested at a check stop and placed into a work camp. My Grandfather recalled when the Germans first took control of Holland they bombed Rotterdam as a show of power to try and stop any thoughts of rebellion. My Grandfather lived in a farm near Rotterdam and he recalled hearing the explosions and seeing the city burn and smell the smoke in the air for days. 

My Grandfather's family owned a grain farm. In one of the silos they built a false bottom and under it they hid Jewish refugees. As the German army still needed food their farm was one of the few places that was not cut off of electricity. Because of this they were able to run electricity down below the silo so that the refugees could have light. When the Germans would come to inspect the farm or search for Jews my Grandfather would run to the edge of the silo and pee against the wall. As he was peeing he would talk down a small hole and tell the refugees the Germans were there. 

After Holland was occupied the Germans placed explosives on the underside of of bridges so that in case of an invasion they could cover their retreat. My Grandfather was tasked with finding out where the fuse wires went so that in case of an invasion they could cut these cords and help the allied army. My Grandfather was chosen to do this as a 12 year old boy is much less suspicious than an adult going around bridge. He was also often tasked with hiding fake passports and stolen food stamps at check stops as the soldiers were less likely to search children. 

I always knew that my Grandfather lived in Holland during the German occupation but i didn't know at all to the extent that they were involved in hiding Jews or any kind of underground resistance movement. It made World War II much more real to me knowing my own Grandfather had lived through it. 

If you have parents, grandparents, great grandparents anyone you know who has lived through events such as a world war ask them about it! I'm sure many of them would be more than happy to share their experiences and sadly most of the generation that lived through these events have already passed on.

Generally speaking, most of these channels produce documentaries that are 10-20 minutes long but you can easily find longer ones on these channels as well.

Does it ever fascinate you that the ancient world and all of history looked just as real as it does when you look outside?,9957,3oy8og,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/3oy8og/does_it_ever_fascinate_you_that_the_ancient_world/,1580,1444998584.0,"Sometimes it is really interesting to me when maybe looking at a field or something void of man made things that that's exactly how the ancient world would have looked; full of color, vibrant, and alive.  Even people too, sometimes I'll see someone and they just look like they could've been born 2000 years ago. And vice verse if you took any person from years ago but they were born today, perhaps snatched an ancient roman right as they were born, they would fit in just fine- maybe they'd love video games, love cars, and perhaps be no different from your average man. 

Seeing black and white photographs whose quality gets worse the further back in time you go, gives a false perception of the world.  Look outside. That's what it looked like. Not some grainy greyscale world.  This is also why I love seeing colorized photgraphs.. It just seems to add another layer of *realness* to it.


EDIT: Wow! So I read through all the comments and it brought up some more interesting points...    

- how much do you know about your great great grandfather? Do you even know what he looks like? With today's technology, our great ancestors hundreds of years in the future will see our life in HD (or perhaps HD will seem unimaginable unsophisticated) but my ancestors in 500 years could see videos of me with friends, making dumb home videos, laughing into the camera, playing sports, and they could see the great leaders and events today.  9/11 will probably be taught in history class for hundreds of years. They won't just read out of a text book though, they'll see the videos....

Her departure was very sudden having gotten up to have her bed made she was taken with one of her smothering spells and expired in a few minutes after she lay down no one being present at the time but Caroline and Margaret. I having gone out of the house a short time before having no idea of the scene that would soon take place. She had become very much reduced before she died being nothing hardly but skin and bone. Caroline is well at this time and wishes to be remembered by you all.  I am in only tolerable health at this time.

We call the baby Wilton Melvin. You wrote that you wanted to know if I was married and who to.  I have wrote too letters since I was married but they may have failed to have reached you so I will inform you that I was married three years ago last June to Margaret Atkinson daughter of Wilton Atkinson of Jonesboro who I presume you know. Our first child was born May the 3 1848 and died August 10th 1849 aged 1 year 3 months and 7 days. We called his name John Emmett.  His wining ways had attached all who knew him to love him. It seemed that all was anxious to be playing with Him when they were where he was. But alas The brickle thread was cut and he took his flight to a better world. Franklin has gone to the Arkansaw him and Sam Pritchett went together a man that goes there within six months and clears five acres get 160 acres for his self wife and child.

I will pay you the balance I owe in a short time without some hindering providence more than I know of at this time.  Write whether you will come in this fall or not as what you intend doing. If all the heirs are willing I think Caroline ought to have everything for ------- with our mother. I think she ought to have what bedding and furniture her mother had.  Her funeral expenses was 18 dollars and some cents.  Her doctor bill I have not ascertained. What stock belonged to her will about pay the above.  1 cow and calf, 8 or 10 sheep 5 hogs which belonged to mother will come very near paying the above.  If what property mother had is sold it will be but a mere triffle when divided.  I am willing to sign my interest over to Caroline if the balance will do the same.  I have wrote to Langford to the same effect and to Morgan also.  Write and let us know what you intend doing whether you can come in the fall or not.  Write as soon as you get this letter.  If you come in this fall I would be glad you would have that deed fixed and bring it.  As I may take a notion to sell.

 The marriage responded to political'needs', but the couple enjoyed a romantic and harmonious union. After the death of his stepbrother Ferdinand VI with no descendants, Charles was crowned king of Spain as Charles III in 1759. A year later his wife died and he never remarried. Charles III remained a widower for the rest of his life without ever having a mistress.

>*In 22 years of marriage, this is the first serious upset I've had from Amalia. The pain that this irreparable loss causes me is equal to the tender love I professed for her.*

This is the letter that Charles III wrote to his parents in July 1738, telling them about his wedding night:

> *My very dear Father and my very dear Mother, I was happy to know that your Majesties are still doing fine, me and my wife are perfectly well, thank God. I received a letter from your Majesties on the 15th of last month, in which I saw how, thanks be to God, your Majesties had received two of my letters.*
> 
> *You assumed that by the time I received this letter my heart would be glad and I would have consummated the marriage. You told me that sometimes young girls are not so easy and that, with this hot weather, I should try to save my energy, not doing it as much as I wanted because it could ruin my health, that I should be content with once or twice times between night and day, that otherwise I would end up exhausted and that is better to serve the ladies little and continuously than a lot once.*
> 
> 
> *About what you asked regarding her height, I will tell your Majesties that according to the portrait I have of my sister, they are nothing alike. With all due respect to my sister, my wife is much prettier and much whiter. She shoots very well and takes a lot of pleasure from hunting.*
> 
> *Your Majesties wrote me as parents and as married people, and asked me to tell you if everything went well and if I find her to my liking, both her body and her spirit, so I’ll tell you how it all went down.*
> 
> *The day I met her in Portella, we spoke lovingly, until we arrived at Fondi. There we had dinner and then continued our journey having the same conversation until we arrived in Gaeta a little late.  Between the time she needed to get undressed and to undo her hair, it was dinnertime and I couldn't do anything, even though I really wanted to.* 
> 
> *We went to bed at nine o'clock and both of us were shaking but we started to kiss and I was soon ready, so I started and after 15 minutes I broke her (her hymen). This time none of us could spill (ejaculate). About what you told me about her being young and delicate, warning me that she would make me sweat, I will say that the first time I was sweating like a fountain but I have not sweat since then.* 
> 
> 
> *Later, at three o’clock in the morning, I started again and we both ""spilled"", both at the same time, and since then we have continued like this, doing it two times a night except for the night when we had to come here since we had to wake up at four o’clock in the morning and we could only do it once. I assure you that I could have done it many more times but I’m controlling myself as you advised.*
> 
>*I will also say that we always ""spill"" at the same time because we always wait for each other. She is the most beautiful girl in the world, she has the spirit of an angel and the best disposition. I am the happiest man in the world having this woman who will be my companion for the rest of my life.*
> 
> *Your Majesties told me that you were eagerly waiting to find out if you were going to have grandchildren. I’ll tell your Majesties that she doesn’t have her period yet, but, by all appearances, she will soon because four days ago she started leaving some stains of this material they say precedes the period.*
> 
> *My wife begs me to place her with the utmost submission at the feet of your Majesties.*

My personal favorite fact is this guy named Ivan the Cabbage. He was Emperor of Bulgaria, and started life out as a simple peasant. By 1277, man had an entire army of angry peasants and Emperor Constantine was having none of it and attempt to put down the rebellion.

Ivan is said to have personally killed the Emperor in the combat. He then stomped Mongol raiders in Northern Bulgaria and defended against the Byzantines after marrying the Emperor's second wife.

TL;DR some peasant kills and becomes the bulgarian emperor bangs the guys wife then kills mongols and byzantines

The War is over. We’ve all had a bellyful. The lights are on again.

Some day when I’m older, someone may read a part of my diary, - a son, a daughter, or their children. War is a blasted stinking show for a cause which is soon forgotten, and which is fed by propaganda and fanned by hysteria. The bugles blow and the bands play, but that is not the true picture you see. War is for the Generals and they see the glory, but not the honor and hardship of their field troops. Medals are never given deservedly to many – many who should be recognized – and a medal bestowed is from then on to be hidden, and bow your head if you ever show one when that war is over.

The code of men who really know and see is silence, because of a civilian ignorance and misunderstanding. All wars are the same and cannot be reported by anyone. Who can, if he is caught in the terrific noise and confusion, the filth, the disease, cold – and then so hot you stink like a dirty animal, - scared – wondering when, and not asking why?

It is not a glamorous, glorious affair; crabs, cooties, some with venereal diseases, hidden, by some, from inspection; gas that is sneaky and dangerous.

Hate the German? I never could, because he is in the same situation as you. He doesn’t like it either.

Don’t look for glamour. There is none. Correspondents can write and pick their spots. We can’t.""

This was written in my great grandfather's diary which he wrote while in Europe during World War One. Initially he served with the British Expiditionary Force before the US joined the war. Later he was serving with the US Army as a Lieutenant. He was injured when a shell exploded near him in the trenches and ruptured his eardrum which resulted in hearing problems after the war. This was one of the last pages of his diary.

It was about how my great-grandfather basically fked up, but also about the resilience of the family afterwards.

Picture of my grandfather when he was 20 and now (age 86): https://imgur.com/a/kxqzO

Grandfather story time:

""During the colonial era of Taiwan, the Japanese were fair rulers most of the time, but of course some abused their power. I was still a child in grade 3 when this happened. My father got in a physical fight with a Japanese policeman over an argument that had escalated. When my mother and brother tried to stop the fight, my father stuck a hoe into the policeman's back. It was a serious wound. My parents and my elder brother fled the scene and hid in a bamboo grove. Meanwhile the local police station dispatched 20 men to my house to look for my parents, but all they found was my little brother and I, both still children at the time. 

The police decided to leave us alone and searched the bamboo grove after they received news that my parents were hiding there. However, by that time, it was too late and my parents fled to another grove already. The police tracked them into the new grove, but they fled to another and another after that. The police were always one-step behind. Eventually my parents and eldest brother fled to my mother’s house in another town. I and my other siblings were left home alone and took care of household affairs. We had contact with my parents who were still in hiding, and this went on for about a month until my parents decided to spend the family’s fortune to bribe local Japanese officials and influential Taiwanese households who were on good terms with the Japanese. The bribe worked, but as a result, we lost our family fortune. At the time, my family was considered one of the oldest and richest in the entire area, but now we had nothing but our name, house, and farmland. 

The Japanese locked up my parents and my brother for only one week and let them go, writing off the assault as an accident. Afterwards, my parents had to work hard to grow enough produce to sell and feed our large family. Of course, I helped too. At the time, I was still a teen. Before the sun even rose, I rode my bike miles to another town called Madou/麻豆, where the vegetables were much cheaper. I biked to Madou, bought vegetables there and came back to my town (Jiali/佳里) in time for the morning market sales. I sold the vegetables for a cheaper price than the other merchants did and so I sold out every time. After that, I still had to go to school. That’s how my family went from rich to poor. After the Japanese left, the Kuomintang (Republic of China) rule was much harsher, and they forced everyone to exchange their silver and gold for Chinese currency and the entire market inflated. Everyone became poor, especially farmers. If we spoke Japanese or Taiwanese, it was considered treason and they locked you up, some people never came back. It was hard to learn Mandarin after so many years of Japanese education. We had to join the Republican Chinese army and we picked up Mandarin out of fear. I don’t remember much of my Japanese anymore, only the basics like “Mango ga oishii!"" (mangos are tasty).""

EDIT: For those of you wondering, I am Taiwanese-Canadian and my family immigrated to Canada when I was 3 years old. I do still speak Mandarin and Taiwanese Hokkien natively. I also took up Japanese in university out of interest. My grandpa still lives in Jiali District, Tainan, Taiwan.",2018-01-13 08:35:55

Looking for something to fill the void left by History Channel's lack of history content? I've got you covered.,8479,bei0br,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/bei0br/looking_for_something_to_fill_the_void_left_by/,543,1555595259.0,"There was a post on Askreddit, asking [what company had lost it's way](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/becepq/what_company_has_lost_their_way/el50vb2/), and one of the commenters said ""History Channel, Discovery, TLC, MTV, etc."". Since suggestions aren't allowed there, I thought I would come here.

(In no particular order)

* [Timeline - World History Documentaries](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg) - has a ton of exceptionally made documentaries, all around 40 minutes or more, ranging from every period of history you can think of. They are like TV quality (maybe they actually aired on tv, Idk). Not only one of my favorite history channels, but one of my favorite youtube channels period. I **highly** recommend it.

* [LEMMiNO](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRcgy6GzDeccI7dkbbBna3Q) - If you like history, drop everything and check this channel out right now. This channel is ABSOLUTELY amazing. The videos are so well made and narrarated that it's crazy. He covers mostly more recent events, mainly focused on strange events, but does so with a professional and non-tinfoil-hatty perspective. Check out his videos: The Vanishing of Flight 370, The Battle of Los Angeles, The Unknowns Mystifying UFO Cases, or any others.

* [The Armchair Historian](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeUJFQ0D9qs6aVNyUt9fkeQ) - This is a history channel specializing in animated military history. The videos are very professionally done, and the host is pretty good. The videos are mostly animated, and around 10 minutes long, give or take.

* [Epic History TV](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvPXiKxH-eH9xq-80vpgmKQ) - Another great history channel, with videos focusing on giant conflicts like World War One, history of nations such as Russia, to the true story behind legends like Blackbeard the pirate. He uses really nice looking animated maps, images, and carefully researches his scripts. Definitely one of my favorite history channels, I highly recommend it. If you're looking for a video rec, try his Napoleonic Wars 6 part series.

* [Kings and Generals](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMmaBzfCCwZ2KqaBJjkj0fw/featured) - They have videos covering the Mongol invasions, Hundred Years' War, Napoleonic Wars, Ottoman Conquests and the Restoration of Justinian, and many more. Another exceptional history channel that I highly recommend.

* [Potential History](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU22SYUm7Z1COjASmmQG1aA/featured) - From channel's description: *""Did you ever hear the tragedy of King Tiger the heavy? I thought not. It's not a story the Panzerwaffe would tell you. It's a Wehraboo legend. King Tiger was a Heavy Tank of the Wehrmacht, so Armored and so deadly he could use his cannon to influence the 88mm shells to Burn Shermans... He had such an unnecessary amount of armor that he could even keep the ones who crewed him, from dying. The German tank design theory is a pathway to many monstrosities some consider to be under powered. What happened to him? He became so up-armored and heavy... the only thing he was afraid of was destroying his transmission, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his adversaries everything he knew, then his adversaries copied the good parts of his design after the war. It's ironic he could save others from damage, but not himself.""*

* [Historia Civilis](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCv_vLHiWVBh_FR9vbeuiY-A/featured) - A great history channel focused on ancient Rome & Greece.

* [History Time](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN9v4QG3AQEP3zuRvVs2dAg/featured) - A fantastic history channel that mostly covers Europe. Two thumbs up.

* [HistoryMarche](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8MX9ECowgDMTOnFTE8EUJw/featured) - A newish channel, but boy is it going places. The videos are very well made, and very interesting. I recommend the two videos, Battle of Poitiers parts 1 and 2.

* [BazBattles](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx-dJoP9hFCBloY9qodykvw) - Covers historical battles, tactics, politics, conflicts throughout history from Ancient Rome to XX century, served with smooth animated narration. I recommend his 1066 trilogy: The Battle of Fulford, The Battle of Stamford Bridge, and the Battle of Hastings.

* [Invicta](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwO-UgquohXwoe7f0e6lMnw) - Definitely one of the best history channels. Very well made videos, that cover a wide range of civilizations and time periods from human history. Primarily produces 2 series, ""How They Did It"" and ""Moments in History. The Colors of history from epic to tragic episodes of our past.

* [Weird History](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc-N24Y5OA0gqbjBwe1ttfA) - Exactly what it sounds like. Videos about really weird moments in human history. Go watch his videos ""Ten Cent Beer Night Was A Total Disaster"", or ""1908 Auto Race From New York to Paris Is An Unbelievable Story"". I promise you'll be hooked.

**Edit 2**

* **Dan Carlin's Hardcore History** - This is actually a podcast, but I thought it warranted recommendation since it's so good. Dan Carlin is an absolute legend, and I would rank this podcast even above the best history YouTube channel.

* **Stuff You Missed in History Class** - Is great too, and deserves a mention.

**EDIT 3**

* [The Great War](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUcyEsEjhPEDf69RRVhRh4A) - I had forgotten about this one when I made this topic, or I would have had it on here too. This channel covers WW1 more in depth than any other channel or podcast around, following the events of the war week by week. The same people also have the equally good channel, [World War Two](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP1AejCL4DA7jYkZAELRhHQ/featured), that follows this war week by week as well. Both are very, very good channels.

**EDIT** Holy cow, thanks for the gold kind stranger!

**EDIT** Silver too? Thanks as bunch!

**EDIT** More gold and Silver? Thank you very much! I really hope you all enjoy the channels. Please have a good day!",2019-04-18 21:47:39

""The fire was returned from the fort, and at the height of the action a live shell landed on Hecla's upper deck, with its fuse still hissing. All hands were ordered to fling themselves flat on the deck, but Lucas with great presence of mind ran forward and hurled the shell into the sea, where it exploded with a tremendous roar before it hit the water. Thanks to Lucas's action no one on board was killed or seriously wounded by the shell, and accordingly he was immediately promoted to lieutenant by his commanding officer.""

He was later awarded the Victoria Cross, was promoted to captain, and married the Hecla's captain's daughter. The couple had three daughters, but the medal was left on a train and lost.

Researching the ancient religions I have realized there is one thing that a majority of ancient civilizations have practiced it was human sacrifice. This horrific tradition was practiced in Ancient Egypt during the First Dynasty 3100 BC to 2900 BC. The Ancient Egyptians followed the belief that in the after-life they would live the same way they had lived in life and believed that they could return back to their bodies that’s why mummification was practiced. The Egyptian Nobility mainly believed that in the after life they would maintain their high social rank, the nobles prepared to have a comfortable after life. The Pharaohs of Egypt were not just simple monarchs but they were considered to be living gods. A Pharaoh felt that his servants in life should also serve him in the next world it was considered an honor. The servants worshipped the Pharaoh and many were convinced to sacrifice themselves by extreme loyalty or the promise of a higher status in the next world.  Examples of this were found in King Aha tomb the second pharaoh of the first dynasty of Egypt. Thirty-five retainer were sacrificed. In the first dynasty other servants of high officials were also sacrificed to follow their master. King Djer Aha's son had 318 retainer sacrifices buried in his tomb and 269 retainer sacrifices buried in enclosures surrounding his tomb. This practice continued until the beginning of the 2nd Dynasty where it withered away.",2018-11-06 05:41:32

Super interesting story about the Manhattan Project and the Atomic Bomb.,8202,6do8no,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/6do8no/super_interesting_story_about_the_manhattan/,446,1495927416.0,"Hey r/history, I'm reading a really good book about the history of the Congo at the moment, and just finished the chapter on World War 2. I learned a really cool story that I would like to share with you.

In 1939, the director of a Belgian uranium mine in the Congo (as it was still a Belgian colony), Edgar Sengier, learned about the military implications of weaponized uranium. Fearing what would happen if the uranium mine or stock fell into the wrong hands, he secretly shipped most of it to a warehouse in New York in 1940. Luckily for him as well, the Governor General of the Congo declared that on the day of Belgium's fall to Nazi Germany, the Belgian Congo would support the Allies, unlike most of the French colonies that aligned themselves with Vichy France.

Sengier moved to New York and was contacted by the U.S. military in 1942 to buy uranium for the Manhattan Project. He told them that ""You can have the ore now. It is in New York, a thousand tons of it. I was waiting for your visit.""

The U.S. Army also secured the remaining 3,000 tons left in the Shinkolobwe mine. The uranium from the Congo was much more plentiful and in much higher quality than the previous uranium being studied by U.S. scientists from North America, and much better and more plentiful than what Germany had access to in Europe.

He was the first non-American civilian to receive the U.S. Medal of Merit. Sengier was also made an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire, Commander of the French Légion d'honneur, and Officer of the Order of Leopold and the Belgian Order of the Crown.

The agreement between the United States, Great Britain, and Belgium lasted 10 years and continued after the war. The uranium agreements in part explain Belgium's relative ease in rebuilding its economy after the war, as the country had no debt with the major financial powers.

I thought that was super interesting that one man very few people have probably heard of had such an enormous impact on history, and that the thousands of Congolese workers that died and toiled in the uranium mines could have never had any idea how much they were to change the course of world history, as before World War 2 uranium was primarily used in much more mundane industries like in glass coloring.

The book is Congo: An Epic History of a People if you're interested in 600 pages of African history. :)

Edit: 

So this is getting a lot more attention that I thought it would! I expected maybe five upvotes. To clarify a few things:

I didn't mean to necessarily characterize the Belgian presence in Congo as heroic in this story, as they did truly evil things in Africa. But I think that it's interesting that because of two Belgian colonial officials, instead of Congo joining the Axis powers, like many French colonies joined the Vichy government, they sided with the Allies and the world's largest and best supply of uranium went to the United States instead of Germany. Irrespective of people's opinions on nuclear weapons and their use in Japan, ultimately, keeping nuclear weapons away from Germany was a good thing, even if in other ways, Belgians were still oppressors of the Congolese people.

Additionally I think sub-Saharan Africa's involvement in World War 2 is an extremely undervalued and underrepresented topic. For example, Congolese involvement went well beyond just supplying uranium. Congolese soldiers also fought Italy in the Horn of Africa, fought with the Allies in Egypt, Palestine, and served as medics as far away as Burma. Congo also contributed a lot of material support to the Allied Powers. This is just one chapter of one country's history in Africa that ended up being really important in the long run for how the rest of world history unfolded. I wanted to point out how momentous events in history can be influenced in unexpected ways, like how the roles of the Congolese and Belgians in the Manhattan Project are probably unknown to most people, or at least surprising in their measure of importance.",2017-05-28 07:23:36

Why did the U.S. Bombers that dropped the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki fly alone? Wouldn't this make them an easy target?,7698,7l573i,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/7l573i/why_did_the_us_bombers_that_dropped_the_atomic/,1631,1513839773.0,"While recently watching footage of atomic bombs being dropped on Japan in WWII, I noticed that there is only two planes visible. The first is the one carrying the actual bomb, and the second is recording the event. 

My questions is why would they fly alone like this? Wouldn't it be much safer to fly in a formation, or at a very minimum have a fighter escort? It seems like a huge unnecessary risk having a slow and sluggish bomber carrying a brand new city-destroying bomb fly by itself over the Japanese mainland. 

And as a second question, why exactly were the two bombers able to safely fly into and out of Japanese airspace? Why weren't they intercepted or attacked by AA guns?

The men who were in charge of Unit 731 suffered no consequences and were actually paid what would now be millions (taking inflation into account) for the information they gathered.

The thing is, in my adult life, former President Carter has been an absolute boss.  He has successfully negotiated the release of hostages in hostile foreign lands and he is a strong, if not the strongest, proponent for helping third world countries when disaster strikes.

Why was he so persecuted in the press and in most homes back in the late 70's when he is now the most active and effective (not even arguably) ex-president for foreign affairs after leaving office?

The belt is 6-feet long and contains ten thousand beads. It depicts a house in the middle, representing the Six Nations. The Mohawk are the keepers of the eastern door and the Seneca the keepers of the western door. They are holding hands with 13 others, representing the 13 United States. (The historian I'm currently reading as well as the Onondaga website say they represent 13 states, but Kentucky and Vermont were already admitted to the union)

The wampum symbolizes friendship with the Six Nations Iroquois and is a visual representation of the Treaty of Canandaigua. This treaty is commemorated annually on November 11, where U.S. officials distribute cloth to fulfill the terms of the treaty.

The problem with this is that it was often obvious that is what they had done, and as a result they were either court-martialed or treated as a coward.

I also heard a few instances of German soldiers at Stalingrad drawing straws with their friends and the person who got the short straw won, and his prize was that one of his friends would stand some distance away from him and shoot him in the shoulder so he had a wound bad enough to be evacuated back to Germany while the wound also looking like it was caused by enemy action.

a. Get you off the front lines for an extended period of time

b. It not being an injury that would greatly affect the rest of your life

c. not an injury where anyone can accuse you of being a coward or think that you did the injury deliberately in order to get off the front?

Meanwhile the South American countries range economically from middle income like Brazil and Argentina, to high middle income like Chile, to low income like Bolivia.

Today he works at a gas station that nearly shares a parking lot with my job. I'm night shift (obviously, since it's 0530) and so is he. He's gassing up my truck and I asked about his accent. I'm interested in the world so it was a friendly question...

He is Turkish but lived in Kazak SSR in the USSR. He was drafted into the Red Army 1983-1986 as a grunt infantrymen/guard. I'm a US Army vet, my dad was in the Marines in the 80's and some of his stories make me realize how much the military has changed in just 30 years. But this man's story made it seem like we were recounting World War Two conditions. 

Basic training was relatively short as he had a para military education in high school. His job (he wasn't specific on a job title such as a US Army ""MOS"". He did say ""Guard"" but was not Military Police) training was OJT at his unit. There would be a squad of new guys who were hazed/tormented/shown the ropes by the rest of the company. He stayed in the Kazak region for this period and his units purpose was to ""guard a center for radiation"". 

I dug at that and I think it was either a nuclear weapons site, research site or test site which used Army soldiers as physical security/gate guards. They checked ID's, roved the perimeter and held exercises on the immediately adjacent grounds. He had an RPG-7 but never fired it, there was never a rocket available! They did have ammunition for Makarov pistols and AK47 rifles. No heavy weapons of any kind. This was a cake assignment and the men knew it. Moral was so-so, boredom was the worst enemy. They lived on site, the workers lived on site, the necessary civilians lived on site. It was almost a prison environment. The nearest town was many hours drive away but hardly anyone got to visit for any reason. (This is not the ""hell"" part yet).

After 1 year his unit was suddenly tasked to go to ""Latvia region"" for a war exercise. Like a force-on-force war game. Keep in mind these are 90% simple Kazak draftees who have been sitting on their butts for years, with no real weapons, no real training or experience and suddenly they are under the microscope for an exercise. They were given all officers who had been to Afghanistan but none of the enlisted men had been. They were utterly destroyed by the opposing force and made complete fools of themselves. There were even fatal accidents. One man accidentally shot one of the senior inspectors with his rifle. A tank had rolled over some men in a ditch and killed them. A man was crushed between two trucks. Several men were injured as they were made to crawl over or under barbed wire with real explosives going off next to them. These were ""flares"" meant to simulate artillery but were powerful enough to burn.

 Due to their big fat failure on this exercise, they went to the USSR - Turkey border as guards to a penal unit of military prisoners. This was punishment for the entire unit, and all its mid and higher level NCOs and officers were stripped of rank and they served together as grunts with a new cadre of officers assigned to them. This is where the real hell started. Keep in mind, these are the guards not the prisoners themselves. They were on near-starvation rations. Those who did not steal from the local populace would go hungry. They would steal from each other. They were beaten by their superiors, threatened with court martial if they made any simple mistake. There were political officers at this unit and any denunciation could send you to Siberia or literally to death. Some men were EXECUTED for voicing concerns that they would starve to death on the issued rations. Not on the spot, but tried in court, found guilty and then executed by firing squad. In winter several men did die of exposure. Many more prisoners died of over work  (on construction projects), starvation, disease and exposure. This man started losing teeth, his hair was falling out and even his nails were getting brittle and breaking. Sometimes the prisoners would attack the guards. His friend was hit in the head with a shovel and killed in front of him. He was attacked and stabbed several times. He said the prisoners were mostly thugs and mentally unstable who had been drafted, committed crimes in the military and sentenced to build roads or similar.... for life. He did participate in some prisoner beat-downs but he says he didn't kill anybody. A form of punishment was to tie up a prisoner naked and pour boiling water on him with a drinking cup, then vodka over the wound. It was like a prison war within a military. 

One day his time was up. He was discharged on the spot at the station where he was serving. But his train pass was not for his home city, the authorities decided he should now live in a city elsewhere in the country. A Soviet citizen was not allowed to decide where to call home, apparently. He was assigned a job in ""industry"", it was already arranged for him.

Rather than this, he used his knowedge of the border area to escape into Turkey. He was a Turk, after all. He lived there for years before emigrating to the US and now he pumps gas at night. I know dictatorship militaries are basic and unforgiving, but men were executed for voicing concern about their safety. And this happened in modern times! Whether it was a reflection of the Soviet Army or of his particular penal control unit, I do not know. He said everywhere Soviet soldiers were hungry, under equipped, poorly led and morale was terrible. Then again, his experience is limited to Kazak region, 1 war game and penal duty. I'm kind of mind-blown to be honest. I had to let it out of me.",2016-08-16 02:19:49

From what I understood, most of the slaves traded by Europeans and sent to the Americas were captured by rival African tribes and traded with them for goods. 

However, as the slave trade increased was that always the case? Did these tribes who were trading with European powers ever gain local power for themselves?

Dear Dad & Mom
	You will probably have started down or have decide not to come when this letter gets home. Even though I suggested that you didn’t come I kinda hope you’re coming. I know you must be planning on it. I have hotel reservations made and either way you decide things will work out alright. I can’t hardly wait for this next week to pass till I can see you. I had to send that night letter through to let you know conditions here. The graduation will consist of having our names read, walking up & receiving our wings and commission papers. Taxis are supposed to be forbidden to come to the field, and the only busses running are G.d. busses for service men. So as much as I’d love to have you come it would be a pretty tiring and rough deal.  I’m so undecided as to which would be best that I don’t know what to suggest. I got your air-mail letter after I wired. Write again and let me know what you finally decide. 
	I’ve made plans for either way so I can see you almost as soon if you decide not to come. I have a reservation on braniff and united airlines to get to Salt Lake on Wed. 9th and if some priority puts me off I still have an alternate. I can get a B-34 to Denver and will be quite sure of getting a B-17 the same day from the Lowry field to salt lake. I’ll be seeing you soon.
Lots of love, Ralph

P.S I got your wire Dad. I think it will be best that way I’ll do my best to be in Salt Lake Wed. I’ll wire and let you know Monday or Tuesday.
P.P.S I met a very lovely girl at church Sunday. She is from the BYU and a resident of Houston. Last Sunday was the first chance I’ve had to go to church here. I met 5 old Y students and knew most of them. Some swell folks from ? and Idaho. One girl that was in some of my classes is a missionary here. I almost like seeing someone from home.

Dear Charles Campbell:
	Have a minute between “jobs” and want so much to again tell you how truly beautiful your song was on Sunday morning. Whatever your own thought is regarding your voice and its production accept the fact that it is unusually beautiful as to quality. – A very special gift to you – and from you. I’ve heard “the holy city” sung numerous times but rarely with your particular understanding and beauty. Please believe me- it’s just an innate something that eludes verbal expression. A spiritual quality so rarely found in “professional” singers. Please don’t ever lose it. 
	You will find opportunities to sing come your way, if at all possible accept them and let your voice ring out in the songs you love to sing – there will always be some receptive souls in your audiences who will be happier because they heard you – and the message out bring in this way. There are plenty of boogie-woogie artists, etc. abroad in the world and in the service but too few of you type. So – “do your stuff”
	I’m taking the liberty of enclosing two little leaflets which helped me so much. Trust you will find them interesting too. 
	On your journey through this particular phase of your life – in an activity which I’m sure none of us would chose – but which we find ourselves in – probably for excellent reasons – I know for you that “the light of god surrounds you; the love of god enfolds you; the power of god protects you’ the presence of god watches over you and keeps you safe and secure.”
					Cordially, Alice N. ?
P.S hope all your wishes come true & you’re sent where you want to go!



Dear Mom & Dad,
	I’ve been pretty busy for the last few days. I’ve never walked so far in my life. Our BOQ is down on a nice little lake about a mile and a half from the line and the Tech. training buildings. Our schedule is pretty well filled up too. 
	I really believe I’m going to like heavy bomb. We’re already started flying and a B-24 is really a good ship. I had three propellers feathered today and was holding my altitude with only one engine turning over. Anyone who tells you a 24 can’t fly on one engine is wrong. I met art Hubermenth? on the street the other night. It was surely swell to see him. He hasn’t changed a bit. If I can I usually get away from the field Sunday I’m going in and go to church with him. Dad, to be really honest with you and me too a car wouldn’t be the most practical thing to get right now. A person almost needs one to get around in and a lot of the fellows have them but the fact remains that I’ll be going over in about 5 months and a week from today; unless they make an instructor out of me here which I doubt. What would you advise me to do Dad? I looked at a lot of cars and about the best deals are 40’ fords & Chevy’s at $1000 & one 40 DeSoto good shape, tires, and accessories, at $1100 with a down payment of $500 and 15 months at about $46.78 per month. Costing about $110 to finance for 15 months. Please write or wire and let me know what you think I ought to plan on. There is a big possibility that I’ll go to Salt Lake from here. There or Fresno Calif. Write soon and tell me what to do
Love, Ralph.



Dear Mom & Dad,
	I’m sorry I don’t write more often to let you know what I am doing and how I am. You can bet I’m in no mischief though, I’m kept much too busy for anything like that. So far I’m getting along OK I guess. The B-24’s are really good ships and I think I’m going to learn to really like them. There is so much to one them though that you can’t appreciate until you learn all about what makes it tick. Would you believe it there is some 28 electrical motors alone on one of these ships. Just to learn all about them and their functions is quite a ?toll
	I guess I won’t fly for a day or two. I hurt my thumb pretty bad. The doctor x-rayed it and found it wasn’t broken so that’s good. My hand is pretty sore and it takes two good hands to handle this ship. The controls have 75 lbs. Tension and it’s a man’s job to pull one of these baby’s into a 60 degree bank without losing altitude. I went to church with art the second Sunday I was here. We went out to dinner together and had a swell time. I really like the car dad. It’s in swell shape and I intend to keep it that way. The tires are beauties I sure do appreciate you helping me but it. I don’t intend to do a lot of excessive driving in it, however, Amarillo is about 250 miles from here and I plan on saving gas and driving up to see Tod if I can ever get a weekend off. It’s a long way but I think it would be well worth it before I leave Texas.
	I’m sorry about the missing pictures dad. I guess it was just a misunderstanding. I tried to pay ?oren before I kept (that was before you gave me the check) and he absolutely refused to take the money. And invested that I keep it and send it to them after I got here. He said as far as everything was concerned it was the same as paid. It was kind of a dirty trick to refuse to give the pictures to Roberto because they weren’t paid for. I sent them the money I hope it’s all straightened out now. Please write often
	Love Ralph.
P.S I got a letter from Tod. He says he’s doing ok. Excuse the scrawling I’m writing in a hurry so I can get to class.

Dear Mom & Dad, 
	I’ve got to fly a mission tomorrow so this will probably be short as I need the sleep. I wish I were there to help you with that new fi truck too dad. I know it really must be tough to get help. I guess you’ll really miss Tod this year. When I get my fifty in I’ll see if I can come back and give you a hand. I hope so. 
	Dad, I’m sorry you felt so bad about my buzzing. It was very foolish. There really isn’t any justification in doing it just for fun but it’s just something everyone has to cut loose and do once in a while. There are times here when knowing how to hit the deck low and fast will save your life and the life of those mine boys riding with you. 
	It isn’t pleasant to see the realities of a war. I’m not saying this so you’ll worry more because I know how you must worry about me now. I just believe I should let you know just what the score is. One of the finest chaps I know is a tail gunner on my buddy’s crew. They were flying right next to me yesterday and I saw the tail end of his ship blow up and disintegrate from a direct flak blast. That isn’t often but it does happen. The chances of coming back are far better than those of going down. The only thing everyone can do is know the rules of the game, whether the game is flying, religion as just loving in itself; and play the game the best I can by sticking to the rules. That way regardless of what happens if you’ve tried our best to do the right thing things will turn out for the best.
	Dad, I’ve seen the worst an enemy can hand out to us and I do know that praying helps. You don’t pray ant because you’re too busy but when you see it coming you put a lot of trust into your heavenly father. We came back yesterday with the hydraulic system for the flaps, landing gear and brakes shot out. We set her down safe and no one had a scratch: I know that it was with the help of the lord that we were able to do that. Don’t worry too much. I plan on getting my fifty. Please write often & write long letters.
	Hello farmers & fermis love, Ralph


Dear mom and dad,
	Guess what, you know how you wouldn’t ever let me buy a motorcycle. Well, here’s the payoff. When we got back from a mission two days ago I went to town and looked up a P-38 pilot who had a motorcycle he wanted to sell me. I agreed on $200 as I could easily get that out of it if I leave here. Well, I came back out to the field and requested a partial pay as I haven’t had my pay for two months. Captain Janesh, my squadron commander asked me what the score was. I told him I wanted a $200 partial pay to buy me a motorcycle. Well here’s the payoff. We had just gotten back from a mission and after flying through the soup to get there, & through the flak & coming back through that stuff & making a forced landing on someone else’s landing strips he told me I couldn’t buy the motorcycle because it’s too dangerous. Mom, I guess I just wasn’t cut out for anything as dangerous as a motorcycle. And to think I thought “ha, mom can’t stop me from buying this motorcycle now. Well, its 2030 and I’ve got to go on another mission tomorrow I’ll write some more when I get back. I’ll try to get some pictures to send you. Please take some and send them to me.



17 Nov. 1944
Dear Mom & Dad,
	It ain’t the heat nor the blistered feet, nor the meals of spam in place of meat, nor the butter like lard, nor our turn at guard, none of these is as half as hard as to jolt in after all the sweat and a cheery voice says “no mail yet.” 
	And it ain’t the breeze, like a dragon’s sneeze, that pecks the kids and weakens the knees nor the dirt in your gun nor the broiling sun. These are forgotten when day is done but our voices fail and our faces pale as we draw a blank when it’s time for mail.
	He can stand the flies and the sand in our eyes, the orders, the rumors, the truth, and the lies, the mosquitos swarm and the water warm and the warts that reek of chloroform what takes our light and makes throats tight are the letters somebody didn’t write.
	I guess I shouldn’t have sent the poem but it was so true I couldn’t resist. The mail has been reaching me though and I’ve been getting quite a few letters. Some get here in as few as ten to twelve days. There however are still straggling in from September. I’ve got to go to bed so I’ll quit. I’m tower officer tomorrow and I’ll have plenty of time so I’ll write more then.
							Love, Ralph



20 Nov. 1944
Dear Dad, I got your letter today saying you were sorry for not writing. It made me feel kind of ashamed of myself for writing such a hasty letter the other morning just because I didn’t get a letter. I know you’re a lot busier there than I am here and I find it hard to sit down and write instead of hitting the bed when I’m through for the day. I know what kind of a deal you must have there this fall with no more help than you have. There’s really not much of a load to carry here dad. 54% below zero over the target and pounding through an eight to nine hour flight do get tiresome but there are hundreds of other guys doing the same thing. It may sound a bit funny and may not be exactly the right thing but I look at it this way. There’s a little white kind of paper in operations that has my name on it and 35 squares. I’m sorta living right there on that piece of paper. Every time when I come back from a mission no matter how rough it was or how much we got shot up I feel good when my whole crew is OK and we walk in and see another one of those white squares colored red. We got 18 of them colored and 17 more and we’ll be seeing the ones we love at home. Of course besides just finishing our missions all of us like to feel as though were helping to finishing this thing as fast as possible. Dad. I find the things that occupy my mid most are plain ordinary things of life. I want to come home just to live for the joy of living & doing [what] I want to get up in the morning, do a good hard day’s work, eat a good meal at a good family table, say hello to neighbors, shoot pheasants, walk out through a pretty field of spuds, drive to town through the snow, go to church on Sunday with my dad, wrestle with the boys and tease mom and the girls, sing in the choir, have a family dinner together on thanksgiving, go fishing, haul more beans with my truck than the next guy can with his, hug my mom, marry the sweetest girl in the world, do as fine a job raising a family as my dad has, build a house and help to make it a home; a million things like that are what I want to live for dad. When I hear a beautiful piece of music that’s what it says, and when I pray those are the things I ask my heavenly father to let me do. I know your faith and prayers are always with me and I hope I can live up to the kind of life you meant for me. I know the mail is pretty bad and how busy you are so I’ll try to have more patience hereafter, and I’ll try to write a little more regularly too. Dad I pray for the lord to forgive us of the things we do wrong and to help us to live worthy of the great blessings we have and thank him very much for my parents. Love, Ralph

I've been on a pre-WWI history kick lately and the region of the Caucasus and the Slavic world in general at and before that time are greatly interesting and (as a white, relatively well educated citizen of the United States with an admittedly limited world view) fairly alien to me. I'm also concurrently on an Age of Exploration kick as well and both periods have pretty heavy undertones of meddling in the regions surrounding the Black Sea. This was just sort of a diversion and nagging question at the back of my mind.

EDIT: My intention with this question was not to open a discussion or debate over race (as even the concept of 'race' is debatable). My curiosity ends at the etymology of the word 'Caucasian' as it relates to geography and history alone. Thankfully my question has been answered and my curiosity quenched by many wonderful and properly cited sources. Thank you to everyone who contributed meaningfully!

But what few know is that by 1943, the Germans had built up some pretty decent evidence that Enigma was vulnerable.  U-boat rendezvous were being interrupted by Allied forces.  A spy in Washington, DC reported that the Allies were currently reading 4 rotor Naval Enigma traffic, and that report found its way to the Abwehr.  Rommel had a submarine cable laid between North Africa and Italy, and used that as much as possible in preference to radio.  In 1944, a German cryptanalyst showed that Enigma could be broken with a crib of just 50 letters.
https://www.nsa.gov/news-features/declassified-documents/tech-journals/assets/files/der-fall-wicher.pdf

Perhaps the clincher, though, is that the Ubootwaffe started experimenting in June 1944 with assigning each operational U-boat on war patrol with their own set of unique Enigma keys.  Prior practice during the convoy battles earlier in the war was to have a set of keys for a particular area, say, ""North Sea"", ""North Atlantic East"", ""North Atlantic West"", ""Mediterranean"", and ""South Atlantic"" key nets.   All U-boats assigned to patrol, say, the North Sea would get the same set of keys.  This allowed the cryptanalysts at Bletchley Park and in Washington DC to build up enough traffic to break the settings on their bombes.  But the lack of traffic in any one key setting effectively prevents that.  By February 1945, nearly all U-boats setting sail on war patrols carried their own unique Enigma keying documents, and the Allies were almost completely shut off from reading U-boat radio traffic.
https://books.google.com/books?id=KO8crflI8AMC&pg=PA262&lpg=PA262&dq=Stummel+began+in+1944+to+prepare+a+measure&source=bl&ots=4l22agG837&sig=eA3RjQg6Jo8CfRFi_oFTcBt5mDs&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwitzIefrPLUAhUJGj4KHc5cDdwQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=Stummel%20began%20in%201944%20to%20prepare%20a%20measure&f=false

I have a personal suspicion that certain people in the German military ""knew"" that Enigma was vulnerable in the latter half of the war and acted accordingly.  They couldn't make a wholesale change, however, because they were too invested in the device.  They had untold thousands in service, and couldn't just abandon them for something different.  

With the secret of Allied success against the Enigma kept secret for around 30 years, along with the cynical sale of Enigmas to ""allies"" of the US and UK, it's illustrative to note that the Germans rejected the Enigma for a much more secure rotor machine when they needed something after the war.

I imagine this is because the British Empire colonised nations that people who now live in the West share ancestors with but I don't really know enough about the subject so thought I'd ask those that do.

[answered] I think the most common answers are that the Ottoman Empire, unlike the British, wasn't actually a colonial empire. They didn't economically siphon where they conquered to pump up the heart of the empire. 

Also, because I'm English, I'm bound to hear more of the British Empire and the troubles it has left behind than I am of the Ottoman.

yesterday I found my grandpa's WW2 mess kit in my parents' house. 
Curiously, the mess kit is apparently a Japanese production and has also some Japanese (or Chinese?) handwriting on it.

My grandpa wrote his initials (J.G.) on the mess kit, overwriting other initials (K.K.). He fought for the Wehrmacht on the eastern front and was later a POW in what today is Kazakhstan.

Why would the Wehrmacht use Japanese/Chinese mess kits?
What does the Japanese handwritten signs say?
Could he have gotten the kit as POW?
What's the story behind this?

Thank you very much!

EDIT: Thank you for all your responses! Looks like my grandpa got the kit in POW camp in Kazakhstan. As u/JacqueShellacque and u/petro26 pointed out it's a Japanese production from 1942. It probably was originally the mess kit of a Japanese soldier, it seems like 木暮 is the family name of the soldier it belonged to originally, Kogure. In between it apparently belonged to some other soldier with the initials K.K.
As u/R0cket_Surgeon and u/W_I_Water pointed out, the Soviets captured Japanese equipment, for example from the Kwantung Army in '45. They might have redistributed it to their POWs. Thanks again!

Dear Mam,

I now take time to write to you, as I know you are anxious to hear from me. I had made up my mind not to write to you again, after our little difference of opinion, but it was against my grain, as I know you were always interested in me, and I know it would be too bad not to let you know how I am getting along whilst in the trenches. I am in the trenches at present, having a lively time of it, and quite realise the murderous work the Germans are doing. Censorship prevents me telling the names of places I have been in, but they are a sight. Beautiful garden citys with no sign of life whatsoever, with these many mansions furnished complete, with the roof blown off, or the gables of the wall shattered, with these many shells, as one goes further along only skeleton of houses are to be seen. Our Dugouts in the trenches are furnished with mirrors, chairs, etc, making things making things look cosy and comfortable. Those being had from the ruined houses close at hand. By day our sentries watch over the parapet just across to the enemy's trenches a few hundred yards away. If there heads were to be seen, they are sure to be shot at, and they are pretty good shots too. They possess a set of men called snipers who seem to be everywhere, that one can't be too sure where he goes in case he is within range of one of these fellows. this is all I can say about trench life in the meantime, it is giving you an idea what is the case in some of the many places in France. I saw Mr <Name>'s brother in (one) of the villages I have been in he was taking over our billets for his battallion the 10th Gordons as we were leaving for the trenches. I myself am having a good time of it and have nothing to complain off, although we aren't getting it all our own way. I hope to be remembered to all the boys, and to those who are anxious to know how I am keeping. I will close in the meantime, hoping you all spent an enjoyable holiday camp, thoughts of it reminding me of Monkton, and the good times I have spent there.

From yours truly
Eddy Currie""

EDIT: Wow thank you all for the responses and PMs. I have replied to you all individually, and am now going through the comments and will reply to any directed to me - wow, not sure I can keep going there's a lot.

Note 1: Monkton refers to a place near Glasgow in Scotland, I shall find out for sure but some of you in the comments have identified the location. My family is Scottish. Pte Edward Currie was Scottish. He died 25th Sept 1915, a month after this letter, I have located his memorial.

Note 2: I'm so sorry, the letters are not for sale, these are too historically valuable and money is not deserving of their worth (if you get me) however I will scan more of them for those who asked. I will endeavour to track down their descendants and give them the letters, the rightful owners I think. Failing that, war museums will gladly accept them I'm sure. I will post Pte Edward ""Eddy"" Currie's other 4 letters for you today - https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/51xofl/pte_edward_eddy_currie_ww1_soldier_letters_5_for/


Note 3: To clarify, these letters ARE currently in my possession (rightfully and honestly) - these young men were hosted at a boarding house ""Oakshaw"" ran by my grandfather's parents, after signing up/prescription, and before they were posted to the south of England, prior to deployment in France. They wrote, very kindly back to my great grandmother ""Mam"" to keep her updated of how they were. I assume they would also have written to their parents but of course I do not have those letters.

Note 4: Thank you, humbly, for the PMs from current and ex-military. I hope my replies were worthy enough.

Note 5: ""billets"" - temporary housing for soldiers. The missing words: ""I hope to be remembered to all the boys"".

Note 6: The 'disagreement' some of you ask about - does NOT sound romantic, more like he mis-behaved before he left/stole something/argued about politics/the war ? Not sure. i will try and find out.",2016-09-09 05:11:54

**Philippine Islands
July 25, 1945**



Stan:


From out of the Philippines (where it, my dear lawyer, is still spelled with (1)L) I send a reply to one of the foulest notes that it has ever been my misfortune to receive.  




Quote ""As for myself, I have been very busy the last week or two.  Although the course of work in this hard boiled, slave driving, under paid profession etc. etc.""




Well, little boy, you may be a shining light in the tiny legal world you exist in, but the insinuation you made in your letter showed me that you don't know what life today is all about.  You are living in a sphere that is bound up with things cut and dried, things which are dealt with as cases and not realities.  And yet you have the impudent gall to sit back and complain about your own way of life.




You who have always had a good home, fine parents, and sufficient funds.  You attended a private school, a college, and a law school in spite of the times.  You got a job in an old firm and you have your place in life.  In other words, you have had everything handed to you on a silver platter and yet you still complain.




You also speak of being busy -- well that is a joke.  It seems to me that I have heard of some others who are busy today.  Have you heard of the B-29 boys over Japan?  Or the carrier task force?  Or the boys who took back the Philippines?  Or the 19,000 boys who had a busy time on Okinawa?  Or the guys on Saipan, Guam, New Guinea, or Guadalcanal.  Or course the Aussies are not busy on Borneo -- of course not!  No these guys and millions of others are merely sitting around finely furnished offices and telling others they ""have been very busy.""




As for being ""hard boiled"" there is no such thing in the service.  All those with whom we associate treat us like their own children.  Things are always calm and serene.  The cases one finds are never crude or tough.  The stinking corpses of American boys (boys whom life never gave a chance) are nice things to observe.  No, life in this business is not hard boiled.  If it isn't then neither is a sniper's bullet thru the forehead.




And then you mentioned ""slave driving"".  The phrase used by you is sheer mockery.  The works of the coalies on the great airfields of China was sheer pleasure.  The Anzio beachead was a picnic for the boys carving out that tiny foothold.  The boys who spanned the plane under point blank fire were having an enjoyable time.  The guys who lugged ashore on their backs the supplies that helped to take Tarawa were just getting some exercise.  No this was not slave driving work it was mere amusement as one might take back home on a quiet Sunday afternoon.




And then you said ""under paid.""  That is just plain riot.  The boys who were killed at Pearl Harbor were ""under paid.""  The men at Kiska and Attu ""were under paid"".  The boys who hit the beach of Normandy ""were underpaid.""  The maquis of France ""were under paid.""  No according to you these men were making a fortune.  Some will come back but is the stinking $50 a month overpaying a dead American private in the lonely mountains of Italy.  Is the service pay of a pilot too much?  Of course he may come back, but there is a chance he may be just charred remains in a wrecked plane.  He does not earn his money he is overpaid.  Yes the boys who invade Japan will be overpaid.  It is too bad that the legal profession cannot pay off like the services fighting this war.  Yes we are all wealthy men according to your idea of being underpaid.""





Stan, I have always respected you for your knowledge and ability but you seem to be so wrapped up in that smug little world of yours that you don't know what is going on in terms of reality.

You see newsreels, read papers, scan magazines and that makes you a judge of your position.  Whether you know it or not you are a very lucky guy.  You have your education, your job and future planned.  And then on top of that you have the audacity to write ""hard-boiled, slave driving, under paid profession.""




If this letter does nothing else I hope that it makes you ashamed of yourself right down to the marrow of your bones.  YOu may say now, ""Who is Brown that he can pass judgment on the great lawyer?""  Granted to your way of thinking he is not in a position to do so.  I think differently.




I am a guy who only had three years in college.  I never graduated or went on to a professional school.  I know very little in the formal sense of the word but you ungrateful wretch I still know more about life than you ever will (unless you change).




I have seen life in its rawest and crudest and death too for that matter.  Yes my sheltered intellect the intellect the sordid and foul things of life can teach lessons.  I have learned things and learned to appreciate things that only the College of Life can teach.  I don't regret this; in fact I am proud of it and I think I will be a better person for all of it.  




If you are half a man you will make some reply to what I have written above.  I realize that it may not be a finely phrased but the truth is not always finely phrased.




Your obedient slave,


Sgt. Richard H. Brown


Army Air Forces


Somewhere in the Philippines





**EDIT**: I'm almost certain that I found Sgt. Brown's obituary and I've identified a surviving daughter.  Interestingly enough, if it's the right obituary, and the daughter is the person I'm thinking of, I actually went to school with Sgt. Brown's grandson for a few years and our families know each other, having met at school functions in the past.  I'll be reaching out to Sgt. Brown's daughter today to offer her these letters.



**EDIT 2**: Left a voicemail on the only number I found on the daughter.  Guess I can only wait and see...



**EDIT 3**: Welp, obligatory thanks for the gold.  I left another voicemail on another number I found.  Waiting on a call back.  So unfortunately no real updates.  Glad this meant so much to so many people, though.  Of course, will update when I have one.",2016-07-11 19:47:50

"I’m AL.com reporter Ben Raines and this winter I possibly found the remains of the last American slave ship, the Clotilda. I’m here with Port of Mobile historian John Sledge and UWF archaeologists Dr. John Bratten and Dr. Greg Cook, who have inspected the ship. Ask us anything!",6320,7xsbmn,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/7xsbmn/im_alcom_reporter_ben_raines_and_this_winter_i/,210,1518747608.0,"Finding Clotilda – the last American slave ship
 
Hello, I’m Ben Raines. I’m a newspaper reporter by trade, so I kept my hunt for the Clotilda, the last American slave ship, secret. I thought people would think I was nuts if I said I was going to look for a ship that had been missing for 150 years. While we can’t say for certain yet that this is the Clotilda, we know that the wreck is from the right era, is the right size, lies roughly where the captain said he burned it in 1860, and the wreck appears to have been burnt.
 
In the end, finding it was mostly down to old fashioned sleuthing. I searched through old records, maps, interviews and newspaper articles, some 150 years old. One of my best resources was a handwritten journal kept by the captain of the Clotilda. I used our epic winter weather this year, including the Bomb Cyclone on the east coast, and the super low tides that resulted from stout north winds for my search window. With the tide so far out, it was if a blanket had been pulled back from the giant swamp where the ship was supposed to have been burned in 1860. There, lying in the mud near an island where the captain said he burned it, I found the wreck of a huge sailing vessel.
 
All of the members of this AMA panel are quoted [in my original story about the wreck, which you can read here](http://www.al.com/news/mobile/index.ssf/2018/01/alcom_reporter_may_have_found.html#incart_big-photo) (don’t forget to watch the video!).
 
On the panel with me are John Sledge, a historian specializing in the tale of the Clotilda and the port of Mobile, and author of the exhaustive history The Mobile River, and two archaeologists from the University of West Florida, Dr. John Bratten and Dr. Greg Cook. Together, they have previously dug up Spanish galleons sunk in 1559 and slave ships off the coast of Ghana. All three of them have visited the Clotilda and can provide amazing insights into the past and the techniques that will be used to investigate this ship. We can also talk about the incredible history of Africatown, the Alabama community started by the survivors of the Clotilda.
 
Ultimately, because of Africatown, the Clotilda is an even more powerful totem than just a slave ship. It is the last slave ship. What’s more, we know more about its voyage and the fate of the 110 souls imprisoned on board than is known about any of the millions of people brought in bondage to this country. We know exactly what part of Africa they came from, exactly when they arrived, who brought them here, and where they ended up after the Civil War. When the war ended just five years after their arrival, they were freed, but also homeless and destitute.  The discovery of the wreck is the final piece of the incredible story of Africatown, a community on the edge of the swamp north of Mobile formed by the Clotilda survivors in 1860 on land they bought from the plantation owner who enslaved them. Many of their descendants still live there today. It is the only community formed by native Africans in the United States. Even then, it was a place apart from both white and black Mobile. The Clotilda group spoke their native dialect, taught their children in their traditional way, and farmed using African methods.
 
Amazingly, their lives were forever interrupted to settle a $1,000 bet between a slave-owning steamboat captain and a group of northerners traveling on his riverboat. Join us for our AMA and ask us anything you can think of about this suddenly revealed piece of our past.

I just found this flag yesterday at an estate auction.  They had it listed at a 48 star flag so I got it for a steal and it seems I was the only person who actually counted the number of stars.  I live in Colorado so this flag is even more cool because Colorado was the 38th state to join the United States.  This flag was made and hung sometime between 1877 and early 1890 when the 43 star flag was made.  I will most likely be keeping this in my personal collection but if a museum near me ever is going to be having an exhibit on Colorado becoming a state or something else this could relate to I will be giving it to them on loan. 


It isn't in the best of shape but compared to the other flags from around this time I have seen the colors are better and there are less holes. 


Thought it was a cool piece of history that ya'll would like to see! Also forgot to say that it is an 8 foot flag. Won't even fit on my huge dining room table!

Did anyone in the Dark Ages or after claim descent from one of the major families in the Roman Empire?,6267,6i5l42,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/6i5l42/did_anyone_in_the_dark_ages_or_after_claim/,657,1497897315.0,"I've been wondering about this after reading a number of articles and books about Rome.

Considering the immense power and size of the Roman Empire, some families had a lot of power and influence as well as lands. However, there are not so many records of what happened to these people and their descendants after the Roman Empire split in two and eventually after it was conquered.

I know Italy was heavily invaded by the Goths and Vandals and that those wars eventually resulted in Italy being very depopulated but wouldn't these powerful people have protected their families and themselves by going to other parts of the empire before an invasion?

Also, after the Dark Ages, many people claimed to be the ""King of the Romans"" and many kings claimed to be the successors of the romans but nobody seems to have claimed direct descend from a Roman ruler or a Roman family.

What happened to this people? 

The oldest contemporary family with proven ties to the Roman Empire that I could find was the Massimo family but even their claim is a bit shady and could easily be just a rumour.  ",2017-06-20 02:35:15

At this point I will turn it over to him to give you more information. I enlisted in the US Navy in 1943, after many stops for training we were stationed on the Makassar Straits carrier in the Pacific theater. We completed missions over the battle zone of Iwo Jima and then on to Okinawa where the Makassar Strait suffered damage and we were transferred to the Shipley Bay. While on the Shipley Bay, my crew suffered a crash while trying to land on the carrier. All members survived and the replacement aircraft TBM-3 #69325 came a day or two later. Recently, I attended a fly-in at a local airport that had a TBM Avenger as the main attraction. After viewing the history of the aircraft from the owner I realized it was the same aircraft #69325 that was replaced to my squadron after the crash. After the war I went on to become Executive Vice President Emeritus  and Professor of Business Administration Emeritus of the University of North Alabama and currently serve on the board of directors for a local bank in my area.

Unlike other known copies that had engraved images of the phases of the moon, this copy included watercolor paintings seemingly by author Galileo Galilei, one of the greatest scientific minds of all time.

A discovery that set the rare book market abuzz, the proof copy, if genuine, would be worth millions. Published in 1610, Sidereus Nuncius set in motion a scientific revolution. The first published scientific work based on observations made through a telescope, Galileo’s work challenged the belief that the Earth was the center of the universe.

Five hundred and fifty copies of the book were originally printed and roughly 150 of those editions are known to exist today. In 2005, when a seemingly original copy with the astronomer’s signature and watercolor paintings hit the market, Sidereus Nunciuscaused a worldwide sensation 400 years after its publication.

In 2012, however, this discovery was proven to be a fake and rocked the book market to its core.

In Secrets of the Dead: Galileo’s Moon, a team of experts uncover the truth behind the alleged proof copy of the revolutionary Sidereus Nuncius, featuring historian Nick Wilding, whose suspicions and dogged research exposed the fraud.

How easy it was for the Vikings to cross the Atlantic,5985,52367m,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/52367m/how_easy_it_was_for_the_vikings_to_cross_the/,506,1473544233.0,"I was always curious about how much of an effort the Vikings had to put down to cross the Atlantic. Turns out to be quite doable IMO. By using Opentopomap and Freemaptool's Horizonfinder I made this map (http://imgur.com/gallery/3smde) to show how far the Vikings had to venture into the unknown before land in the horizon disappeared behind them and before new land would appear in the horizon in front of them.

I have plotted the visible horizon from the most prominent peaks at the shores of the respective lands. As you can see, there is a lot of prominent peaks visible at great distances offshore all along their assumed trial. Perfectly suited for discovering new land. 

The longest unguided stretch is between the Faroe's and Iceland (picture) and would take roughly 10 hours under favorable conditions (182 km at 10 knots). A wee bit longer than the distance between Amsterdam and Brussels. 

If we take into account high probability of mirages in arctic waters (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirage#Superior_mirage) and the fact that the longships had masts up 16 meters high (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longship#Sail_and_mast)
extending range of 15 km either direction, it is quite possible that they could see land through the entire journeys with favorable conditions. 

During the polar summer the days are long, weather is pleasant and the Vikings probably had plenty of time on their hands, so they could probably tailor their time to explore. Moreover, the wide angle of error possible before missing land could mean 
that precise navigation was not very important. Now if they could sustain themselves during the journey by hunting and fishing it must have been a pretty straightforward task. 

Having sailed from Shetland to Norway myself in less than 24 hours during summer (350 km), I can say that it is surprisingly lenient. Additionally, I found some pictures of Snæfjell taken from Reykjavik to illustrate how much you can see at the eh.. event-horizon. Reykjavik lies right on the edge of the red circle around Snæfjellsnes. 
It is still clearly visible indeed, and if ""lost"" at sea, a welcome sight. For more fun on calculating horizon distances you could use this simple calculator. (http://members.home.nl/7seas/radcalc.htm)

"""WWII was won with British intelligence, American steel and Russian blood"" - How true is this statement?",5966,88yguv,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/88yguv/wwii_was_won_with_british_intelligence_american/,1670,1522695715.0,"I have heard the above statement attributed to Stalin but to be honest I have no idea as it seems like one of those quotes that has been attributed to the wrong person, or perhaps no one famous said it and someone came up with it and then attributed it to someone important like Stalin.

Either way though my question isn't really about who said it (though that is interesting as well) but more about how true do you think the statement is? I mean obviously it is a huge generalisation but that does not mean the general premise of the idea is not valid.

I know for instance that the US provided massive resources to both the Soviets and British, and it can easily be argued that the Soviets could have lost without American equipment, and it would have been much harder for the British in North Africa without the huge supplies coming from the US, even before the US entered the war.

I also know that most of the fighting was done on the east, and in reality the North Africa campaign and the Normandy campaign, and the move towards Germany from the west was often a sideshow in terms of numbers, size of the battles and importantly the amount of death. In fact most German soldiers as far as I know died in the east against the Soviet's.

As for the British, well they cracked the German codes giving them a massive advantage in both knowing what their enemy was doing but also providing misinformation. In fact the D-Day invasion might have failed if not for the British being able to misdirect the Germans into thinking the Western Allies were going to invade elsewhere. If the Germans had most of their forces closer to Normandy in early June 1944 then D-Day could have been very different. 

So ""WWII was won with British intelligence, American steel and Russian blood""

Such a time period is defined by a more or less sudden catastrophic event, e.g. by a devastating war, epidemic, climate change, or political rebellion, triggering a sudden downfall of societal institutions and rule of law. This presupposes, of course, organized society to being with, degrading into more or less an unorganized one.

Such a society would lack organized police and functioning courts, and with no publicly maintained infrastructure or education system - but maybe with pockets of strong military and advanced education and research within wealthy subcultures (such as a powerful family, tribe, or geographical region, within the otherwise dystopian area). It would furthermore be characterised by stagnation, poverty, very little to no internal manufacturing of goods and lack of added value to economic organisations. 

Even though ""the public"" funding schools is quite a recent phenomena, there has many times existed some organisations (e.g. the catochilc church in medieval Europe) funding and supporting education. I am thus referring to a situation during which the local society and culture would have been drastically changed for the worse, greatly reducing conditions for quality of life for the common man, as compared to _before_ the dystopian regime.

In order to qualify as a ""dystopian time period"", I'm thinking a duration of atleast 75-125 years. Hence, I'm not asking about temporary anarchy (examples of those are more easy to find online).

Did any such time period exist anywhere in the world? Where/When? How long did it take to come out the stagnation and if it did, what would have been the most important factors inducing the change for the better?",2018-04-12 06:12:00

Our story begins with the army of the Medes (Persian neighbors and predecessors) meeting the army of the Lydians (credited with first creating silver/gold coinage) at the Halys River in modern day Turkey. The two nations had been engaged in a 6-year long war, and this battle was shaping up to be quite large and potentially decisive. 

Fighting broke out across the lines, and it was unclear which side would gain the upper hand until oddly enough, the sun went out.
To a very superstitious and religion-oriented people, eclipses were messages from the gods, or an omen at the very least. Herodotus, an ancient Greek historian writes that the two fighting armies ceased their fighting at sight of the eclipse, and brokered a truce through Babylon. 

Just thought I'd share with today's events and all. Funny how much our opinion of natural phenomena can change over the course of a few thousand years!

What do you think is the most historically important event(s) for an American citizen to know?,5703,67g9qp,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/67g9qp/what_do_you_think_is_the_most_historically/,1875,1493152779.0,"Let me elaborate. I need your help 'saving' my marriage. My husband knows startlingly little about history. (And geography and biology and ... well, you get the idea.)

""Who won the American civil war?""
                     The..... South?

""Who were the Axis powers in World War II?""
                     Germany... And China.

""Find India on this map.""
                      I can't.

He has no idea what the Dust Bowl was. Completely in the dark about the Great Depression. He wasn't even sure what the Civil Rights movement was. 

He graduated public school in Louisiana with a 4.0 GPA. But that's beyond the point.

I believe being a good citizen and well rounded individual means having at least a basic understanding of history. (Especially the history of the country you reside in.) So, I have decided to try to get him up to speed with history. (He's on board, too, I'm not just pushing history down his throat. :P)

So my question is: What are the most important historical events that every voting, tax paying adult should know? (In American history or worldwide.) 

Bonus: Any good books that deals with the aforementioned historical event(s) in engaging and accurate ways. 

Bonus Bonus: Any good history teaching tips.

How much did the U.S. know about the Holocaust before reaching the concentration camps?,5673,80duiw,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/80duiw/how_much_did_the_us_know_about_the_holocaust/,686,1519688116.0,"Hi, me and a few friends recently got into a debate about whether the U.S. knew about the mass killings going on in Germany during WWII. A quick google search showed the the United States know about the persecution of Jews going on in Germany, as evidenced by the immigration of hundreds of thousands of Jews into the U.S, however persecution is a broad word which doesn't make clear how much was known. I thought that this would be an interesting topic since it is important for putting into context the U.S's decision not to enter the war until provoked and it is generally important for furthering my, and hopefully others, knowledge of one of the most horrible events in human history.

One more question I have if the U.S. did not know about the full extent of Jewish persecution is, how did the Nazi's hide what they were doing from the rest of the world?

The missionaries that Asoka sent to China, Japan and other far-eastern countries in the 2nd century B.C. were a major contributing factor to the buddhist and pacifist lifestyles of their people that we see today. And from China, it spread to the west of course, in the end.

"Life in medieval village of Montaillou, described in detail (names and personal lives) thanks to the recordings of a local inquisition chief and his interviews with locals",5568,7m75o9,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/7m75o9/life_in_medieval_village_of_montaillou_described/,237,1514314030.0," I will try to summarily describe the context of my title as well as the book, it being the incredible insight in lives of locals.
The man, Jacques Fournier, was obsessed with recording nearly everything, and during his few years of chasing heretics in southern France (early 14th century) , he conducted hundreds of interviews/interrogations with locals, ranging from peasants to clergy and nobles, recorded nearly every word on paper and later brought those texts with him when he became the Pope, so they survived.
In 1975, using those texts as a basis a French historian wrote a very fun book called ''Montaillou'', by the name of the village that is the focus of the story. Book doesn't have a fictional story, it simply follows the village over those years, using Fourniers texts as a basis.  Amazing thing is that the said village still exists, with the same name and the same place (as do all surrounding villages). Right next to it are remains of a small castle/fort which was mentioned a lot in the book.

The reason why Montaillu is the subject of a modern book is because 25 of the interviewed people came from that village - a village numbering less than 200 people. That gave as an incredible insight in lives of ordinary people, who were ironically immortalized by the man that they were afraid the most - by immortalized, i mean that we know their names, their occupations, their private problems, their opinions of their neighbors, their world view, religious view, the course of their life over those 10 or so years.

For example, we know that the village had a castellan from the local noble family of Foix, he and his wife being the only nobles in the village. Community being small, he was practically the ''jack of all services'' doing various work, both policing and helping the local populace in anything needed. His wife was a lot younger and after he died she left the village and moved to the one next to it. She had quite a few lovers, including a local clergyman. Interesting thing is that she had quite a normal friendships with local peasant women, e.g. she would meet a girl she knows and they would hug in the middle of the street and chat like any modern neighbors.

People almost never spent time inside their own house except during night - when not working, which was quite often because of mad number of free days, people would visit each other, spending time in other houses or simply in the field or street, chatting all day. Also, it is described that a lot of people lacked certain things in their own homes (which were practically one room houses with no furniture), so those that had things like oven or certain tools, freely landed them to their neighbors.

A village had a small tavern with a barmaid who brought beer and occasionally wine at the doorstep of her customers, by order. Folks used to travel quite a lot (which is surprise to me since i always thought medieval peasants never went anywhere), visiting festivals and fares in towns up to 50 miles away. They also took their grain to the local town (Ax-les-Termes, still exists)  some 20 miles away nearly weekly, since the village didn't have a mill. Some men occasionally visited the same town because of prostitutes - the town possessed a nearest brothel, and inquisition seemingly had no problem with it.

The political opinion of locals is well described by one of the heretics ''There are four evils in this world - the satan, the king of France, the Pope and our local bishop'', quite describing that their world view was somehow very limited. In other details it can be concluded that their knowledge of the world didnt expand further than 100 mile radius.

Atheism was of course punishable, but there were few people here and there who publicly gave some atheistic claims, like:

A witness told Fournier that Raimond deserved to be put to death for saying that Christ was not created through divine intervention, but ""just through screwing, like everybody else.""

Guillemette of Ornolac, was brought in for interrogation because she doubted the existence of the soul. She expressed the opinion that what is referred to as the “soul” is nothing more than blood and that death is final. When Fournier asked her if anyone had taught her these ideas, she answered: “No, I thought it over and believed it myself.''

Mortality of course was very high, and was viewed by locals as an absolutely normal thing. Death of a child was nowhere near traumatic as it is for modern women. Hunger was periodic - there were practically alternating periods when they ate a lot and were practically getting fat, and then periods when they would be on the verge of starvation - this happened within the year, with early spring being the worst period.

And so on and so on, for more details there's the book,   anyway i recommend this book to any history fanatic, but to anyone else too really - it's much more fun than it sounds, and it kind of humanizes the famous peasants of medieval times, showing us that they weren't nearly as stupid or ape-like as portrayed in movies. They weren't too different from some highlanders that right now live in semi-isolated places of Appalachian mountains or northern Scotland etc.

Village today (the church is very well preserved from the time of the story and still functioning, while the castle is just a ruin)

Walked away with a new understanding of slavery in America by visiting a National monument.,5569,4xltpf,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/4xltpf/walked_away_with_a_new_understanding_of_slavery/,951,1471163275.0,"I was on a road trip and stopped at the Booker T. Washington National Monument in Virginia. While reading one of the information posts, one sentence resonated with me in such a way that I walked away with a new understanding of what slavery in the United States was like. Addressing the slave trade, it read along the lines of, ""While physical punishment was certainly a factor that kept slaves working to produce high-quality crops, an even larger factor was the possibility of family members being sold away if crops did not yield enough money for the plantation owners. Slaves worked to keep their families together.""

That really just portrays the horror of slavery in a way that no textbook has ever been able to for me.

What was a going on here? Why did they think one thing and then do the complete opposite?

Did they just think their own political careers and wanted to keep the war out of people's minds so it wouldn't damage their own futures?

also on the pbs website: http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/camp/view/#lower

Update 3: Some additional information about the film thanks to u/Khnagar:
""Memory of the camps"" is indeed Hitchock's documentary about the camps, but it was not ""hidden from the public"" for fourty years. After the war interest in the footage waned, there were plenty of similar documentaries around, and the footage used for ""Memory of the camps"" was available in various film archives and institutions, not at all hidden away. Hitchcock was involved with the documentary, but it was not his creation alone, and it seems that his involvement had mostly to do with how the material was structured.
In 1980 someone discovered the old reels (though the sixth reel was missing), and it was shown at the Berlin Film Festival in 1984, and broadcast on American PBS in 1985. The youtube uploader seems to have ripped this from a 1993 VCD.
I remember reading earlier this year that The Imperial War Museum is restoring the whole original movie, with the missing sixth reel, and it will be shown on the BBC in 2015, for the 70th anniversary for the liberation of Europe.

I never knew that any such warning was given, and thought this was interesting so I thought I'd type it out the text from the  almost 72 year old document from a photo I snapped:
__________________________________________

Part I - Psychological Warfare

1. Below is a copy of the first leaflet (AB-11) which was dropped on Japanese cities in conjunction with the Atomic Bomb. 

2. A translation of the above leaflet follows:

TO THE JAPANESE PEOPLE:

""America asks that you take immediate heed of what we say in this leaflet.

We are in possession of the most destructive explosive ever devised by man. A single one of our newly developed atomic bombs is actually the equivalent in explosive power to what 2000 of our giant B-29's can carry on a single mission. This awful fact is one for you to ponder and we solemnly assure you it is grimly accurate.

We have just begun to use this weapon against your homeland. If you still have any doubt, make inquiry as to what happened to Hiroshima when just one atomic bomb fell on that city. 

Before using this bomb to destroy every resource of the military by which they are prolonging this useless war, we ask that you now petition your Emperor to end the war. Our President has outlined for you the thirteen consequences of an honorable surrender: We urge that you accept these consequences and begin the work of building a new, better, and peace-loving Japan. 

You should take steps now to cease military resistance. Otherwise, we shall resolutely employ this bomb and all our other superior weapons to promptly and forcefully end the war. 

EVACUATE YOUR CITIES

*end of document*

Edit: Didn't expect my post to get this much attention. Thanks /u/Georgy_K_Zhukov for clarifying the unfortunate timing of when these were dropped. Right after the second, but before potential additional bombs, apparently. IIRC there was another lined up to be ready a few weeks later. Fortunately the Japanese Empire surrendered when they did. 

In any case I've seen a lot of interesting discussion here on morality in war and justified use of force. Thanks for everyone's (civil) input.

Unlike polytheistic religions that almost went extinct and its believers relatively easily converted to Christianity or Islam. Whether it was in Africa, Europe, Indonesia, Philipines and what not. What made Monotheism so successful?
And why didn't this change succeed in India?
Many have tried to convert the Indians. The Muslim Mughal empire ruled over India for 300 years, and even before it there was the Muslim Delhi sultanate. And after the Mughals, the British empire ruled over India, with many Missionaries such as Mother Teresa trying to Convert the Indians to Christianity.

My great grandfather Kurt Wittig and his life and death in the Wehrmacht [Updated],5207,7p9e2m,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/7p9e2m/my_great_grandfather_kurt_wittig_and_his_life_and/,312,1515553730.0,"Almost two years ago, I made a post about my great grandfather Kurt Wittig whose [photo collection](https://imgur.com/a/R1T92) from his time in the Wehrmacht I inherited. Quite a few people were interested in it and I just got some crucial information about him and wanted to post an updated version of my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/4a53d0/my_great_grandfather_kurt_wittig_and_his_life_and/):

My great grandfather was Kurt Wittig, born in 1912 in Berlin. He died on 9 March 1945 fighting the Red Army near Henryków Lubański. 

I started poking around in our family history in 2015 and amazingly my grandpa handed me a collection of ca. 150 photos his father Kurt took during his entire military career. I think they give you a very unique perspective into the life of a Wehrmacht soldier. This is the album of the most interesting photos: https://imgur.com/a/R1T92

What you can see in the pictures: 

* [Reichsarbeitsdienst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichsarbeitsdienst)
* Bootcamp near Potsdam
* One or more pictures of the [Westfeldzug in France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_France)
* pictures from Poland right before the Attack on the USSR
* pictures from [Operation Barbarossa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Barbarossa) and subsequent operations in Ukraine

He took some notes on the back of the pictures which I included in the description. The furthest locations I got were in Eastern Ukraine/Southern Russia. 

Here is what I know about his military career based on information of the German [WASt](https://www.dd-wast.de/de/startseite.html):

* basic training with 4. / Infanterie-Ersatz-Battalion 9 in Potsdam until 30.05.1940
* transfer to Infanterie-Regiment 477 and assigned to 257. Infanterie-Division from 04.06.1940
 * deployment at [Maginot Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maginot_Line) in June 1940
 * deployment in Poland in preparation for Operation Barbarossa in July 1940
 * marching into Ukraine in July 1941
 * transfer to France in August 1942 (rotation for resting maybe?)
 * deployment in Southern Russia in April 1943
* wounded (left thigh) in Donez (today Isjum) and promoted to Unteroffizier on 09.09.1943
* hospital leave till 25.11.1943 (in Reservelazarett 133 and XXI (Vienna))
* deployment around Kriwoi-Rog (today Krywyj Rih)
* KIA 09.03.1945 near Henryków Lubański from a ""Rohrkrepierer"" (I think in English that's a squib round) (assigned to Festungs-Infanterie-Bataillon 1458)

His detailed records don't exist anymore or are at least not present in the official archives. His regiment seems to have been wiped out in August 1944 after retreating across the Dniepr and Bug rivers in the months prior.

If you spot anything or have any questions, I am happy to help but I would be also grateful if you see anything that gives you hints about locations, unit, time. I already added a great deal of infos people helped me with. But maybe there is more. 

The intent of my post is not to glorify a man I never knew and that neither my parents of grandparents knew. I am simply researching one of my relatives and his live and death in the most horrible conflict the world has ever witnessed and if anything I want to encourage other people to do the same. My next project might be researching my other great grandfather who died in Italy in February 1945. ",2018-01-10 11:08:50

Wikipedia cites the above-mentioned historians as follows: 

*They conclude that Edison's version was able to outstrip the others because of a combination of three factors: an effective incandescent material, a higher vacuum than others were able to achieve (by use of the Sprengel pump) and a high resistance that made power distribution from a centralized source economically viable.*

For another example, the Lee-Enfield rifle was at first manufactured with a magazine cutoff, again to stop soldiers ‘wasting ammunition’. My question is, why was this doctrine dominant among some western militaries, and why were they so afraid of soldiers burning through all their ammunition?

Most soldiers who fired their weapon aimed over the heads of their enemies to purposely miss because they couldn't handle killing another human being. He cited the world wars and the Vietnam war. He gave statistics that only about 15% were actually trying to shoot the enemy.

When I was in the army, they taught us to aim low because most soldiers aim too high. It was implied that this was done by accident rather than intentionally.

Some of them were  hardened criminals who were convicted in a court, and the judge  gave them the choice "" Join the army or go to jail "". Others were drunks or those who wanted to get away from a messy marriage or debts.

During the course of the war, the US military executed 161 men, mostly for rape, and or murder. Some took place in the US, some in Britain and in the case that I am about to outline, in Europe, after the D Day landings. 


Each case was investigated, a courts marshal trial was conducted and a verdict of guilty was returned. The order of execution was approved  by  either General Eisenhower or in some cases by the Commanding General of that theatre of the war.

Now to the hidden part. All of the 96 men were buried at the same place, a French civilian graveyard. All of the graves have only a number, from 1 to 96 on the headstones. No names, no unit, no serial number. Each of them had been hung, by a US army executioner, ( who lied to get the job by saying that he had been the State executioner in Georgia ) who botched quite  a few of the hangings because he was drunk. 

No body else wanted the job so he stayed in the job until the end of the war.

These men were hidden by the US military.

The reason ? Their victims were civilians, and that was hushed up.

Hey Everyone,


I was reading about the history of Somalia during world war 2. I knew a bit about the war so I was just refreshing my memory. However, I come across mention of a naval battle off the coast of Somalia. Apparently, bombers forced U-852 to beach on the coastline during a naval battle.  The text is below: 

>As U-852 broke the surface, her gun crews swarmed out and manned the anti-aircraft guns. Even as the crewman were reaching their battle stations, the Wellingtons were starting their second strafing run. The planes roared overhead and smothered the boat with fire. Oberleutnant Georg Colditz and Matrosenobergefreiter Josef Hofer both died on the bridge. 

>U-852 was down by the stern, unable to dive and under attack. By this time, it was clear to Eck that his boat was finished. While he could not save his boat, he was determined to save his crew, and his only hope of accomplishing this was to beach U-852 on the Somaliland coast before the British sank her. 

>Although doomed, the U-Boat managed to hold off the British throughout much of the day, her gunners beating off each aerial attack. Several of the crewmen were killed or wounded during the repeated strafing runs, but causalities were surprisingly light given the circumstances. That afternoon, while still under attack, Eck managed to save the bulk of his crew by beaching his battered boat off the Somaliland coast at Ras Hafun. 
>Source:  Theodore P. Savas - Silent Hunters: German U-Boat Commanders of World War II

Intrigued, I dug a bit deeper but couldn't find much information on what happened to the wreck. What I did find was that the Captain was unable to scuttle the ship. So the British were able to loot the boat. 

Since I am in Somalia, I decided to google the town ""Ras Hafun"" (In Somali: Xaafuun). I then zoomed in and went along the coast. **I was shocked to find what resembles a wreckage.** 

I am not 100% sure but the rock formations resemble those in the few photos that remain of the wreckage. Here is what I found:

[Wikipedia for U-852](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_submarine_U-852) 

Photos of the wrecked boat from WW2 [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mikeclicks/3536461275) and [here](https://legionmagazine.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/HallidayInset21.jpg) **notice the rock formations** 

(Google map of the wreckage)[https://www.google.so/maps/place/Xaafuun/@10.4033218,51.2693899,205m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x3da35bfe9a01caa1:0x8dddae942f710314!8m2!3d10.4232604!4d51.2612177!6m1!1e1] 

This could obviously be the wreckage of any ship, or it could be nothing at all. I was hoping for you guys to look at this and to get your opinions on the following:

1) Does this resemble the wreckage of a Uboat? 

2) Is the location of the wreck sufficient with the historical material?

3) Do you notice similar wrecks in the area? 

If there is enough interest, I can make a trip to the region (It will take atleast 2 days and some planning) to check out the site and confirm. 

Please let me know what you think. 

Edit: Map showing location of U-852 [here](http://i.imgur.com/uAKuuFg.png)

Edit2: Some sources say it was beached near Bandarbeyla (far away from Ras Hafun). I search this coast and was unable to find much. Can some people check out the coast here?

Edit3: I found an RAF report that says the wreckage was ""just south"" of Ras Hafun. This would coorespond with the wreckage found on google maps. https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-RAF-III/UK-RAF-III-11.html

In addition, I found a classified Australian military report on the incident. It is quite detailed. Just ctrl f ""852"" http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/Naval%20Warfare%20Nov-1944.pdf

Edit 4: **Is anyone in the UK?** There are numerous photos, oral, and written accounts of the battle and search for U-852. However, they take quite a while to respond to me and charge a large fee to get the documents digitally. Can someone go to the Imperial War Museum in London in order to get copies of those documents?


Edit 5: Can someone look at 9.576783 50.803232 and tell me if it resembles a submarine? I see two distinct shapes. It is 100km from the original site though. So I am wondering if I should venture out.

I knew my grandfather and grandmother fought in a war in China, but never knew it was as far back as World War II until today. Were were eating lunch and she suddenly went into her bedroom and brought out some thing to show us.

She brought out some newspaper clippings and pictures that my aunt took during a ceremony she was in back in April. She told me they, the people sponsoring the event, found about about her through the internet; which amazed me. She showed me the clippings her neighbors brought her. There were 7 or 8 people that they were presenting and she was the only female.

&nbsp;

Grandma never talked about what happened, that's why I never knew, except today she decided to open up a bit. She said my grandfather was in the medical corp and they were together, doctor and nurse, during WWII. She showed me the picture of my grandpa in the military and mentioned how handsome he was and how he's wearing his uniform with the medical badge.

&nbsp;

Then she brought up stories on how they would have to travel on foot to escape the Japanese, begging for food and shelter. How they have to travel at certain times to prevent capture, blood soaked foot wrapped in hay and more... A lot of the shelters were burned down to prevent the Japanese soldiers from utilizing it when they had to abandon it. She would be walking over dead bodies everywhere, making the trail to Jinmen, China for the battle. That's when the story ended and we talked about her upcoming birthday in November.

Bruno Lüdke: Germany's worst serial killer during the Weimar Republic and The Third Reich - who actually never killed a single person,5023,4twa7c,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/4twa7c/bruno_lüdke_germanys_worst_serial_killer_during/,411,1469124447.0,"This is Bruno Lüdke after his arrest in 1943: https://imgur.com/a/Lu86O

Up until quite recently he was considered the worst serial killer in German history who supposedly killed 53 people (and confessed the murder of 84 actually). After modern examination of the cases, he most likely never killed a single person. And that story tells a lot about the Police in the Third Reich and the continuation of police work after WW2 in Germany.

Bruno Lüdke had a mild mental disability, someone who was considered ""unwertes Leben"" (unworthy life) according to the laws of Nazi Germany. After a few petty thefts, he was known to the police and actually sterilised in 1939.

In January 1943, the body of Frieda Rösner was found in Köpenick (South Eastern Borough of Berlin) and Bruno - who was from Köpenick - was found near the crime scene. Even though he was considered harmless, he started to confess the murder of Rösner and countless other murder victims dating as far back as the 20s.

It turned out that he had a complex interdependency with the police investigator.

Bruno Lüdke was both a blessing and a curse for the police and the propaganda apparatus: He fit the stereotype of a degenerate criminal perfectly but on the other hand he was living ""proof"" that someone could kill 53 people under the eyes of the police. Furthermore, he was a blessing to the police because they could produce results and confessions for unsolved cases which was the only thing they were supposed to do, there was no internal affairs department or compliance committee. There were policemen from other cities that objected to the obviously fabricated confessions: 
- how could a poor ""simpleton"" travel across Germany?
- how could he memorise complex geographical and criminological facts over a 20 year period if he didn't even know how many minutes an hour had?

But these protests were silenced, a detective from Hamburg was even sent to the Eastern Front where he died in 1944.

Lüdke was sent to Vienna eventually where medical tests were conducted and during one such test involving under-inflation they cut of his oxygen supply and he died. This was likely an ""elegant"" way to dispose of him.

During the Nuremberg trials, the Reich Police was not considered a criminal investigation which meant that a lot of policemen where vouching for each other that they were ""clean"" and could continue working in the police force. These policemen started working on the legend of Bruno Lüdke to justify their work and that they did a proper job even in an unjust system.

Only in the 90s, questions were asked and the files were examined.",2016-07-22 02:07:27
Examples of the ignoble death of Kings?,5019,cwp8yo,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/cwp8yo/examples_of_the_ignoble_death_of_kings/,1020,1567047940.0,"Went down a bit of a rabbit hole. Was reading about [Charles VIII of France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_VIII_of_France). Interesting dude, lead a powerful French army, kicked off the Italian Wars, big impact on history. Died by smashing his head on the lintel of a door on his way to watch a tennis match. 

Such a bad way to die. But it jogged a memory. He wasn’t the only French king to die by smashing his head on a doorway. That lead me to [Louis III of France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_III_of_France), who, as the story goes, died when he mounted his horse to chase down a frightened girl, & smashed his head on a low door way. 

Two kings of France killed because they didn’t duck. What are the odds. 

Then that got me curious about the deaths of other French Monarchs. Which led me to [Philip of France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_of_France_(1116%E2%80%931131)); killed when his horse tripped over a pig while he was riding along a river. And [Charles II of Navarre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_II_of_Navarre), who died when his doctor prescribed that he be wrapped in linen soaked in alcohol. The linen promptly caught fire; caused either by a careless maid with a candle, or a pan of coals to heat his bed. And, of course, [Henry II of France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_II_of_France) who died in a jousting accident, when the splinters of his opponent’s lance got through his visor & punctured his eye. 

That’s quite the list of accident prone monarchs. Dangerous being the king, and that’s not counting all the wars & assassins & that sort. 

So that got me thinking.  What are some other great examples of monarchs with ignoble deaths?",2019-08-29 11:05:40
How did Roman military generals command so much power?,5007,5mwi39,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/5mwi39/how_did_roman_military_generals_command_so_much/,511,1483977861.0,"I've always been interested in ancient history, so naturally The Ancient Roman Empire is fascinating to me.

I've been listening to a podcast that chronologically covers the written history, and one question keeps popping up in my head. It seems like during unstable times, almost any general who commanded an army(number of legions) could potentially march on Rome. 

How do these generals have so much pull over the soldiers they command? Is the answer as simple as ""because he's the general of those particular legions""? It seems like there would be more checks and balances to prevent this, but from what I'm gathering, many generals basically had their own armies that were under their sole command. Are the soldiers not loyal to Rome first?

Thanks for your time!

"The most famous historical figures of the second millennium by decade, according to Wikipedia [international edition]",4931,6zmmto,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/6zmmto/the_most_famous_historical_figures_of_the_second/,408,1505248180.0,"**TL;DR**

Pretty pictures [here](http://tinyimg.io/i/GMlV3gK.jpg) [*[mirror](https://i.imgur.com/FAmB5Qk.jpg)*] and [here](http://tinyimg.io/i/mqvpCbp.png) [*[mirror](https://i.imgur.com/DhjWeE6.png)*].

*Update*: also [here](http://tinyimg.io/i/NwNB9ly.jpg) (see comment at end).

*Clarification*: people are listed under the decade they were *born*, not then they were active. 

**Background**

I recently posted a graphic on /r/history showing [the most famous historical figures born each decade of the second millenium](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/6x6hly/the_most_famous_historical_figure_born_each/), using an algorithmic measure of 'fame' based on each figure's English-language Wikipedia page (a combination of article length, number of revisions and pageviews). By far the most common feedback I got was about the strong (and expected) Anglo-Saxon bias inherent in using English Wikipedia. The most glaring example of this was the appearance in the list of some lesser-known US presidents (Van Buren, Buchanan, Grant) at the expense of more famous international figures.

To counterbalance this, I decided to also analyse a number of other large Wikipedias: **French**, **German**, **Spanish**, **Russian**, **Japanese** and **Chinese**. I originally planned to do Arabic too, but being a fair bit smaller than the others it seemed more susceptible to random noise. Rather than scraping new names for each Wikipedia I just reanalysed the names I scraped from the English Wikipedia (using Wikidata to find the corresponding non-English articles), my reasoning being that anyone famous enough to top a decade internationally should at least have a Wikipedia entry in English. To save time I also stopped at 1900 (this sub's 20-year-rule made the 20th century births mostly arbitrary anyway).

**Results**

A comparison of the **[most famous person born each century](http://tinyimg.io/i/mqvpCbp.png)** in different languages nicely shows the various biases (e.g. Goethe/Washington/Napoleon/Bolivar/Pushkin topping their respective languages in the 1700s). The Japanese and Chinese columns also highlight the huge Western bias in the European-language Wikipedias.

An **[updated decade graphic that takes all the languages into account](http://tinyimg.io/i/GMlV3gK.jpg)** also seems a definite improvement. While 71 of the 90 decade-toppers were unchanged from before, the 19 changes are mostly improvements: (old winner on left, new winner on right)

- 1890s: Dwight Eisenhower → Mao Zedong
- 1850s: Teddy Roosevelt → Vincent Van Gogh
- 1820s: Ulysses S. Grant → Fyodor Dostoyevsky
- 1790s: James Buchanan → Alexander Pushkin
- 1780s: Martin Van Buren → Simón Bolívar
- 1750s: Alexander Hamilton → Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart
- 1620s: Blaise Pascal → Molière
- 1590s: Oliver Cromwell → René Descartes
- 1570s: Guy Fawkes → Johannes Kepler
- 1550s: Walter Raleigh → Henry IV of France
- 1500s: Anne Bolyen → Charles V
- 1400s: Skanderbeg → Gilles de Rais
- 1380s: Henry V → Donatello
- 1350s: Owain Glyndŵr → Dmitry Donskoy
- 1320s: John Wycliffe → Hongwu Emperor
- 1240s: Eleanor of Castile → Pope John XXII
- 1190s: Anthony of Padua → Frederick II
- 1140s: Nizami Ganjavi → Minamoto no Yoritomo
- 1110s: Bhaskara II → Manuel I Komnenos

**Update**

As suggested by /u/haveamission, here's **[yet another version](http://tinyimg.io/i/NwNB9ly.jpg)** with the various Wikipedia metrics  normalised to avoid weighting the English Wikipedia higher on account of its greater popularity. The most obvious change is the higher number of French and HRE monarchs and mostly Italian artists.

**Update #2**

For a list of the top 250 people in the combined list, regardless of birth date, see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/6zmmto/the_most_famous_historical_figures_of_the_second/dmxuw1x/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/6zmmto/the_most_famous_historical_figures_of_the_second/dmxuwo0/). These use the non-normalised data so still contains some bias towards Anglo-Saxon figures.",2017-09-13 04:29:40

How have combat units in major modern wars not all end up deaf?,4922,6tmast,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/6tmast/how_have_combat_units_in_major_modern_wars_not/,817,1502745131.0,"I've thought about this many times.

I have an 8mm Mauser that I made the mistake of firing one time without earplugs and my ears rang for a long time- and that's an example of a typical rifle that there would have been dozens of in a firefight, not to mention explosions, etc.

We've all seen the movies where guys have a firefight and then have low-voiced conversations afterward, is that all BS? Those guys couldn't have been able to hear anything.
