Joe's Talking Trees,124,dnd3to,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/dnd3to/joes_talking_trees/,15,1572120908.0,"Joe was a simple and serious man. He was a carpenter in a small village named Arge Oaks where he owned the store ""Joe's Carpentry."" 

For years Joe impressed his fellow neighbors with the highest quality carpentry work. Some people in town complained he was a bit too expensive, but no one ever questioned the quality of his work. He was the best and business was good. 

In fact, it was so good that the other carpenters in town, jealous of his success, started to rename their stores to things like ""Joe's Woodworking"" and ""Joe's furniture"" in an attempt to steal his business. 

Furious with his fellow carpenters, and more than a little hurt, Joe formulated a plan. 

""I'll show them."" Joe said, muttering to himself. ""I'll go to the deepest part of the forest to find the best and most rare wood! Once I have it, I'll craft the most amazing piece of furniture ever built!!! I'll put it right outside my shop, so everyone knows who the rightful Joe is!"" 

Determined, Joe set off the next day at dawn. He went deeper into the forest than ever before, and then deeper still. After several days of hiking he came upon a clearing with three trees in the center. Amazed, he approached the trees with wonder; the wood was better quality than anything he had ever seen. 

""They're magnificent, these are exactly what I needed!!"" Joe exclaimed while reaching for his axe. 

""Why thank you Joe."" Said a gravelly voice. ""We have watched you for some time."" 

""Uh... wh.. who's there?"" Asked Joe, brandishing his axe and shaking with fear. 

""We are the Ents of the forest Joe, we tend to all the trees throughout our domain."" Said another voice, the same yet distinct from the first. 

Joe looked up into the trees, trying to find the source of the voices. Gazing into the branches he saw what appeared to be faces in the bark of each of the trees... angry faces. Their eyes were smouldering red, and they had furious scowls that only gnarled wood could produce. 

""You've been carving up our brethren Joe. YOU WILL SUFFER."" Said the Ents in unison and they attacked Joe with all their fury. 

""I didn't know!!! Please, spare me!"" Cried Joe, but to no avail. 

He was bludgeoned, scratched and beaten, but not defeated. Joe knew wood, he knew it well, and he had all the tools to chop down the toughest of trees. So he mustered his strength, and attacked with everything he had. Chopping, hacking, sawing, and breaking. All the while the Ents screamed at him with wild fury, seemingly possessed. Once Joe had gotten over his initial shock, he realized the trees were fairly slow, and it wasnt hard to avoid their attacks. Finally, after what seemed like days, the battle turned in his favor, yet the Ents continued their attack, even in the face of defeat. 

""Please, just calm down."" Joe said, exhausted. ""I dont want to hurt you anymo-"" A branch smacked him in the face, and he chopped it back. ""STOP! You guys are living miracles, I dont want to kill yo-"" *Whap* A small twig hit him right in the family jewels. Enraged and exhausted Joe's mind snapped. 

""I said, CALM DOWN! *chop* CALM DOWN! *chop* CALM DOWN! *chop*"" Every time he said calm down he chopped again and again with the axe, til nothing was left moving. 

""There,"" he whispered with a crazed look in his eyes ""you're calm now."" 

He started crying and whispering to the dead wood, begging it to talk again and apologizing while kissing the mangled branches. 

""You're ok, you're just calm now. I'll take you back home my friends."" Joe whispered maniacally. 

For weeks Joe dragged the dead Ents back to Arge Oaks. With each passing day he fell deeper into madness, whispering to the wood. 

When he finally returned to town, Joe rebuilt the Ents as much as he could and left them in front of his store. They were glorious works of art and the whole town gathered to ask Joe about his trees with faces. 

""They aren't trees!"" He snapped, his eyes roving crazily around. ""They are ents, and they can talk!!"" 

The crowd looked around uncertainly. 

""Well, why aren't they talking?"" Yelled a man in the back. 

""They are just calm."" Said Joe, kissing a trunk and whispering madness. Unnerved, the crowd dispersed. 

Joe kept making amazing furniture, better even than he used to, but he kept whispering to the ents and kissing them. Soon enough the people of the town stopped caring about his quirky way with the ents, ""It's just part of his wood-working genius"" they would say. Life got back to normal. 

About a month later a rich land owner came to the small village to commission the famous Joe for a elegant table. Looking around the village he saw three separate carpentry stores with Joe in the name. Baffled, he asked a local where he could find the actual Joe. 

The local raised an eyebrow and pointing towards Joe (who was stroking and kissing the rebuilt ents) the local said,
""Here in Arge Oaks, everyone knows that' the real Joe kissin the calm ents.""",124

The frog,227,dn9raw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/dn9raw/the_frog/,11,1572097190.0,"
There was this little boy about 12 years old walking down the sidewalk dragging a flattened frog on a string behind him. He came up to the doorstep of a house of ill repute and knocked on the door. When the Madam answered it, she saw the little boy and asked what he wanted. 

He said, ""I want to have sex with one of the women inside. I have the money to buy it, and I'm not leaving until I get it.""

The Madam figured, why not, so she told him to come in. Once in, she told him to pick any of the girls he liked.

He asked, ""Do any of the girls have any diseases?""

Of course the Madam said no.

He said, ""I heard all the men talking about having to get shots after making love with Amber. THAT'S the girl I want.""

Since the little boy was so adamant and had the money to pay for it, the Madam told him to go to the first room on the right.

He headed down the hall dragging the squashed frog behind him. Ten minutes later he came back, still dragging the frog, paid the Madam, and headed out the door. The Madam stopped him and asked, ""Why did you pick the only girl in the place with a disease, instead of one of the others?""

He said, ""Well, if you must know, tonight when I get home, my parents are going out to a restaurant for dinner, leaving me at home with a baby-sitter. After they leave, my baby-sitter will have sex with me because she just happens to be very fond of cute little boys. She will then get the disease that I just caught. When Mom and Dad get back, Dad will take the baby-sitter home. On the way, he'll jump the baby-sitter's bones, and he'll catch the disease. Then when Dad gets home from the baby-sitters, he and Mom will go to bed and have sex, and Mom will catch it. In the morning when Dad goes to work, the Milkman will deliver the milk, have a quickie with Mom and catch the disease, and HE'S the son-of-a-bitch who ran over my FROG!""",227

I went up to at least 100 different people in China and asked them a couple of math questions

The first was “What is 109 squared?”. Around 68% of them answered correctly, which I was shocked about.

Then I asked “If 2 lengths of a triangle are 37 and 29.5 then what is the other length?” Again, to my surprise, 73% answered correctly.

So I kept on asking and asking with some consistent results.

Running out of ideas I decided to do an easier question.”If 10 people are standing in a quadrilateral and half of them walked out, how many people are still in there?”

Unexpectedly everybody didn’t answer, in fact nobody even attempted, just straight up denied they knew the answer to this one simple question. This was defiantly a big surprise because even some 6 year olds could work that one out.

So in conclusion it seems that Asian people can be good at math, but refuse to recognise the Ten Men Square Problem",6

A gambler gets a notice from IRS that he is being audited.

As  they are waiting in the office, the IRS agent looks over his paperwork  and says:

“The reason for your audit is that you have a relatively  lavish lifestyle, but not much income to justify it, can you tell me  what you do for living?”

Gambler says “I am a professional gambler.”

“A gambler?” said the IRS agent with slightly puzzled and surprised look on his face.

“Yes, I make my money by betting, would you like a demonstration?”

“Sure” said the IRS agent “let’s have a demonstration”

“I will bet you $1,000; that I can bite my eye” said the gambler.

“OK,  you have a bet” replied IRS agent with a smirk on his face. The gambler  pops out his glass eye and bites it. IRS agent is shocked as he did not  see that coming, and he did agree to a $1,000 bet in from of gamblers  attorney.

“All right, all right, this was not really fair” said  the gambler. “I will give you a chance to win your money back. I will  bet you another $1,000 that I can bite my other eye.”

IRS agent  looks over the guys paperwork and see that he is not legally blind and  takes the bet. The gambler takes out his dentures and bites his other  eye. The IRS agent is now visibly stressed and sweating for being on the  hook for $2,000.

“I tell you what. Double or nothing, I will  stand on the edge of your desk, close my eyes and piss into the garbage  can on the other side of the room without spilling a drop, what do you  say?”

IRS agent is a little perplex, but does not see how that  would be possible and takes the bet. The gambler stands on the agents  desks, unzip his pants, closes his eyes and pisses all over the agents  desk.

“YES!!!” exclaimed the IRS agent knowing he won the bet and does not own the gambler any money.

“Ahh, shiiiit” said the attorney.

“What’s the matter?” asked the IRS agent.

“Well, he bet me $20,000 that he will come to your office today, piss all over your desk, and you would be happy about it.”",49

Realizing that nothing was going to happen that night, I went to sleep.
The next day I took off of work to spend time with her.

We went out to a nice lunch and then went shopping at a big department store.
I walked around with her as she tried on several very expensive outfits. She couldn’t decide which one to take, so I told her we’d just buy them all.

She wanted new shoes to go with her new clothes, so I said, “Lets get a pair for each outfit.” We went on to the jewelry counter where she picked out a pair of diamond earrings. She was so
excited. I started to think she was testing me because she asked for a tennis bracelet. I threw
her for a loop when I said, “That’s fine, honey.”

She was nearing sexual satisfaction from all of the excitement. Smiling with excited anticipation, she finally said, “I think this is all dear, let’s go to the cashier.”

I could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, “No baby, I don’t feel like it.”

I said, “Honey! I just want you to HOLD this stuff for a while. You’re just not in touch with my financial needs as a man enough for me to satisfy your shopping needs as a woman.”

said Clint. He smiled, and Natasha did too. Life as an Avenger was tough at the best of times, living with the constant danger, with the heavy responsibility, seemingly with only the responsibility for Nat, whilst others wielded the power. And these last few years, these were the worst of times. Since Thanos had snapped his oversized purple fingers and erased from existence 50% of the universe, people had spent five years trying to move on. Some did, but not Nat, and not Clint. And yet they found each other, again, just like in Budapest all those years ago, and maybe they had found hope. Hope for the future, found in the past; as they were currently in 2014, travelling in a spaceship across a foreign galaxy in search of a power as old as time itself. They were, very literally, a long way from Budapest, and it was exhilarating. Clint hadn’t been this far from home since Sokovia, when it was a flying rock in the sky. Nat hadn’t been closer to a home since, well, since she actually had a home. And they were flying a spaceship through space. Perhaps none of this makes sense. But the excitement was palpable, and for the first time in a long time, their smiles were borne of genuine joy.


“Better strap in, we’re making the jump.”


They could see the hexagon coming closer. It was bright, not blindingly so, but enough to illuminate the surrounding emptiness in the void of space. And then more appeared, locked in on each side like a honeycomb, but these were dimmer, as if Space itself knew of their trajectory. Maybe it did, maybe that’s what Nebula meant when she said that their route was fixed. Nat wouldn’t know. Clint didn’t care. They were almost there. They were at the end of the tunnel, and the light had reached them.


And then it was white, and then it was black.


“That felt a bit underwhelming.” Clint thought to himself, before realising that he hadn’t actually been breathing. Letting out a weak laugh to compose himself, he glanced at Nat, who was also panting ever so slightly. They’d just travelled through a wormhole, and for these two, that would always be as crazy as it sounds. Nat reached out and Clint grasped her hand, holding on tightly, as if she might slip away if he loosened his grip. But he wasn’t going to let go. They were closer than ever before.


A warning sound rudely interrupted the moment, and Clint looked ahead. They had arrived, and the ship was preparing to descend. Soon they were cutting through clouds, which Clint swore had not been there a moment earlier, and then they were surrounded by an eerie light, seemingly with no source. There was no ‘Sun’ over here. This was Vormir, they had been told, and it was the dominion of death, whatever that meant. Clint had seen plenty of death. He was responsible for a lot of it recently. But whatever lay in store for them here, they would face it together.


The ship landed with a thud, and Clint again found himself in awe at the astounding technology and engineering that made this possible. They stepped out, and boy was it a sight to behold. Below them were the lakes, scattered between dunes of some sort of solid material. It was like a desert, if the sand was black and the land had been flooded with a copious amount of orange fluid. Mesmerising, but quite creepy. Clint made a mental note never to bring his family here on holiday. When he gets them back, that is. If he gets them back.


“Hey. I think it’s up there.”


Nat’s voice broke Clint out of his latest daydream. He turned around, and in front of him was a giant mountain, seemingly as steep and high as Everest itself, although Clint knew that to be false since he could clearly see the enormous fortress-like thing on its summit. It looked harsh, gloomy, and not at all welcoming. But it stood out, like a beacon of light for two lost souls in search of redemption.


“I bet the raccoon didn’t have to climb a mountain.” Nat rolled her eyes. They were almost at the top, and she was tired.


“Technically, he’s not a raccoon.” Clint was tired too, but he didn’t want to show it. They were so close. They were going to make it, and they can be tired together after.


“Whatever, he eats garbage -” Suddenly they were on alert, gun out for her, arrow at the ready for him. Black Widow and Hawkeye, founding members of Earth’s greatest defenders, ready to face off against the shadow that now blocked their path.


“Welcome,” he hissed, in a soft voice. Clint thought it sounded familiar, maybe from a movie he had watched before. Which was it, Lord of the Rings? The Matrix? Clint couldn’t remember. “Natasha, daughter of Ivan. Clint, son of Edith.”


Clint and Nat exchanged confused looks. This was freaky. “Who are you?”


“Consider me a guide. To you, and to all who seek the Soul Stone.”


“Okay, you tell us where it is, then we’ll be on our way.”


The shadow smiled wryly. It was an ugly smile, as if full of pain and regret. “If only it were that easy. The stone is there, for one of you. For the other… an everlasting exchange. A soul, for a soul.”


He pointed behind him. A long, winding track led to an elevated platform beside a cliff. At the centre of the platform, at the centre of the planet at the centre of the universe, standing tall but no longer steady after eons of wind and rain, was a lever.


Silence fell between the trio as there was no longer any need to explain. It was obvious, only one could pull the lever, and the other would take the stone. It was a trigger, a death sentence for oneself, but hope for the rest of humanity. A steep price to pay, the only question was who would pay it.


Clint caught Nat staring at him. From the depths of his heart he cared for Nat. They had this bond, more so than lovers, more so even than family. It was a special relationship, and Clint knew it. He would never let her get hurt. Whatever it takes.


“I guess we both know who it’s gotta be.”


“I guess we do.” Nat’s voice was soft, but determined. She had a steely gaze in her eyes. And then she took a step forward. And another. Clint frowned.


“I’m starting to think we mean different people here, Natasha.”


But Natasha didn’t stop. She picked up speed, and Clint started running too. He threw one of his grappling hooks, but Nat parried it away with her blade. He whipped out his bow and fired a stun arrow, but Nat anticipated it and dived away. He realised that Nat knew him too well, knew his tricks and knew his thoughts. He couldn’t outwit her here. And the lever was fast approaching.


Clint realised with horror that he wouldn’t be able to catch her. They were equals in strength and ability, but Nat had the head start, and he was carrying more weight. She would get there first, and she would sacrifice herself to save him, to save everyone. But a noble death was still death, and Clint had seen enough of death. He was not going to watch Nat die in front of him. He couldn’t bring himself to do it. Not even for the world.


He forced himself to focus, to think clearly, call upon the fabled split-second decision making of a legendary marksman and think! Nat was going to kill herself. She was going to pull the lever. She was going to die. And suddenly it occurred to him that there was only one way to save Nat – the lever. He couldn’t get there first. But his arrows could.


With one swift motion, honed beyond perfection through years of action, his left hand sought out the bomb arrow and his right hand drew the bow. He dived to one side without breaking stride, and as the unobstructed angle came into view, the arrow soared from its resting point and a split second later, the lever was gone in a cloud of dust and rock.


Nat turned and stared at Clint in disbelief. Clint sat on the ground, drained, not physically but mentally crushed by the realisation of the consequences of his action. Somewhere in the distance, the shadow observed. Many had sought the Soul Stone in his tenure as its guardian. This one was different, and, it would seem, the last. He floated over, and in the same wispy voice asked, “Why, Clint? Why did you do it?”


Clint was too dazed to think. All he could say was the last thing that was on his mind before his hand pulled the trigger, in a brittle whisper, voice shaking: “Better Nat than lever.”",0

The Thing About How Charged Your Phone Is...,0,dnhfuw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/dnhfuw/the_thing_about_how_charged_your_phone_is/,3,1572141969.0,"We all have smartphones, that's an undeniable fact.

We all have phone chargers. Some are 3 feet long, some are 20 feet long, and some are 2 *inches* long.

Our phones and our chargers are just two of the many many MANY different things we HAVE TO KEEP TRACK OF in a society full of dangerous or helpful situations where you would need a charged phone in order to survive. Situations like calling emergency services, calling family members to say hello, and calling an Uber because your designated driver Jerry decided to go to the bar and down 20 shots of Everclear during Last Call.

In any case, as we all know, in order for our phones to stay on, we have to charge them once in a while. 

Now for a lot of us, the way we keep track of how much charge our phone has, is by a percentage that's displayed next to a battery logo. It's highly recommended that you locate your phone's charger when the battery reaches 15% of it's total charge.

Some people, like me, don't *immediately* reach for the charger when the battery reaches that percentage. That's because those people have a tendency to attach themselves to their phone and put off reaching for their phone charger until the very last minute when they actually need it.

These people are known as ""Charger Procrastinaters.""

The psychology of a Charger Procrastinater (CP for short) is a fairly simple and easy to understand concept that affects SO MANY PEOPLE, that I'm willing to bet many of you reading suffer from a mild or major form of this.

For the CP, at 15% charge, they will usually acknowledge the fact that their phone may need to be charged, but will make no attempt to connect their charger, even when they are sitting RIGHT NEXT TO IT.

At about 12-13%, the CP may consider locating the charger (if they haven't already), but will still make no attempt to connect it to their phone.

At 8-10%, the CP may consider connecting the charger, however, they will usually decline in favor of watching a few more YouTube videos or browsing a few more Reddit threads.

At 5%, the CP heavily considers plugging the phone charger into their phone, but the video isn't over yet, and they think they'll plug their phone in once its over, or there's more entertaining comments on the thread and they wanted to see a few more.

At 4%, the video is over, but the CP clicks on another to watch it in it's entirety, or they click out of a thread to find a way cooler one just a few scrolls down.

At 3%, the CP completely forgets that they were about to plug in the charger in the first place and keep themselves entertained...

And at 2%, a phenomenon happens that changes the CP's mind almost instantly and forces them to plug in the phone charger......



Many scientific studies have been published about this phenomenon, but none can quite explain it's incredible existence. Science has yet to solve and fix it, and even now the process is ongoing and moving at a very slow pace.

Scientists have coined a name for this experience...





They've called it ""The Oh $#!? Moment.""


At 2%, the CP scrambles to locate their charger in order to plug it into thier phone before it meets its untimely demise. If the CP is successful, they breathe a sigh of relief. If not, the CP defeatedly plugs in their phone and waits until the phone has enough charge to turn on.

The Charger Procrastinater is an interesting creature due to the fact that it's sole flaw is its inability to plug in its phone to its phone charger. Science isn't advanced enough to understand the existence of this phenomenon, and it probably never will, but I believe that with time, the Charger Procrastinater will eventually die out, and a new generation of reasonable plug inserters will look back in fond remembrance of the Charger Procrastinater and all its 2 percenting glory.

Now if you'll excuse me, I'm at 2% right now and I can't seem to find my charger...

Thank you.",0

The Creature in the Hotel Room,0,dng462,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/dng462/the_creature_in_the_hotel_room/,0,1572136137.0,"A guy is driving back home to Edinburgh late from work one night. He's still got a long way to go - about 150 miles in fact, but he's already feeling incredibly tired. These last few nights have all been the same, to be honest. Every night he finds himself dragging his slumped body into bed for about four hours sleep, waking up and travelling to work again. It won't be for much longer, though, as he's already decided to quit and start somewhere new. But until then he's got to deal with the long hours and late nights.

But he's sick of it, and he decides that tonight he's not going to drive home. Tonight, he decides, he's just going to find a hotel and stay the night. Fortunately, almost by chance, the next turn off marks that there's a hotel.

After a winding country road that seems to go on forever, the road stops suddenly and the faint lights of a grand, five storey building glow atop a hill. None of this makes sense to the man; he's been driving this road for years and never knew there was a hotel here, nevertheless something as large and beautiful as this. The car park is empty, and the night is too still for his liking, but he's too tired to argue with the voice in his head that tells him something doesn't seem right.

He enters the grand foyer where a lone man stands to greet him.

""Hello, weary traveller. I imagine that you wish for a room. You are free to stay the night at no cost in one of our best suites. But there is one thing that you must do for me in return.""

The man, powerless to argue and his mind already imagining a nice warm King size bed, nods and asks what the thing is.

""Oh, nothing much my friend. You must simply refrain from doing what your impulses will want you to do when you enter the room. Inside the room is a cage, and inside the cage is something that you nor I can fully understand. But, and this is the important part, no matter how much you want to do it; you must not touch it. I repeat; DO NOT TOUCH IT.""

The man, startled, agrees and is shown to his room.

The room is lavish, indeed. Gold and oak flooring, columns of ivory notched marble, and a four poster bed. But, in the shadows where the lights dare not approach, is the silhouette of a hulking mass wrapped behind bars. Breathing. And watching.

The man goes to the bed and falls to his sleep, too tired to care. But, an hour or so later he awakes to hear the sounds of rattling. He turns and sees that the shadows in the cage are active - thrashing back and forth, rocking the cage. A voice in the man's head tells him to approach. He feels powerless because the urge to reach out and touch the creature is too great. And so he does.

The creature ROARS with might and rips the cage apart. The man has time to grab his car keys and run. He runs down the stairs as the grunting of the beast aporoaches.

ROOOOOOAAAAAARRR

He runs out of the front door. The roar fainter but nevertheless still chasing behind him. The creatures feet thump heavily as it snaps and bends the flooring below it.

RoooooaaaaaAAAR

He goes for his car. He gets in and starts the engine.

Rooooaaaarrrrrr calls out the beast, charging for his car 

He tears down the road, and for a moment he thinks he is safe.

RoooOOOOAAAAARRRRR

The beast jumps on top of his car and starts pounding. The man panics and turns his car off of the cliff edge onto the rocks below. As he drags his broken body out of the car and clambers over sea water and rock, he hears the noise that has been haunting him for what now seems like a lifetime.

ROOAAAARRRRRRR

The man turns to see the creature drop from the cliff above and stare at him. It begins to charge his way. The man, crying and begging for mercy, puts his arms out to protect himself, but he knows it is pointless. The creature towers over him and takes its prize.

ROOOOOOAAAAAAARRRRRR..... Tag, you're it!!! *Runs Away*",0

So he got in his car and drove down to the local hostel, when he arrived there the secretary asked him what he was looking for, now him and his wife were quite sexually active and have tried a lot so the guy asks her for something very different. The woman tells him about this one woman who can give a perfect blowjob while singing in the most amazing voice even better than Beyonce. So he agrees and pays the secretary and walks up the stairs to go see the prostitute. When he gets up there she tells him that she will do her job but the lights must be turned off until I say so. She turns off the lights and gives him the most tight amazing blowjob he has ever had while also singing loudly and clearly. He goes home and thinks about it for ages and tries to work out how she did it. So he goes back the next day and the exact same thing happens and he goes home and thinks about it again but he decides to go back the next day and turn on the lights half way through.

The Cheerio Story,0,dn9mnm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/dn9mnm/the_cheerio_story/,2,1572096268.0,"They call it... the Cheerio Story

So there's this Cheerio walking down the street one day when he finds a magic lamp. He gives it a rub, and a genie popa out and says
> Mortal Cheerio, for freeing me from my prison, I shall grant you three wishes.

The cheerio thinks on this... and he thinks... and he says: ""Genie, I have lived my entire life as a boring, plain, everyday, ordinary Cheerio, and things have not been going very well. I feel I could do better if I were just... something else. Genie, I wish to be.... a Honey Nut Cheerio.""

And so, the Genie turns our normal, boring, plain, everyday, ordinary Cheerio into a Honey Nut Cheerio, and his life instantly improves—albeit marginally. People take a liking to him, and he starts to gain friends for the first time in his life. Sadly, this is the extent of the changes. Thus, our Cheerio returns to the Genie, and the Genie asks:
> Mortal Cheerio, have you decided on tour other two wishes yet?

Our Cheerio responds: ""Yes, Genie, you see... having now lived as a Honey Nut Cheerio, things have improved, but not as much as I had hoped. I feel as though I thought too small and wasted my wish... Genie, I think yet more could be out there for me if I were something else; I wish to be... a Chocolate Cheerio.""

And so, the Genie turns our Cheerio into a Chocolate Cheerio. He takes up a newfound interest in self-improvement and athleticism. He trains and trains for years, mastering every sport he learns. Eventually, he becomes an Olympian and wins all Gold for his nation. This fame and fortune is better than his life before, but he still feels something is missing in his life, yet he cannot determine just what it is. He returns to the Genie, and the Genie says:
> Mortal Cheerio, have you decided on your third and final wish.

""Yes, Genie,"" our Cheerio replies, ""I have. I lived first as a boring, everyday, ordinary, plain Cheerio, and things were awful. Things had imrpoved as a Honey Nut Cheerio, and still improved further as a Chocolate Cheerio, but Genie.... I feel there is yet more out there for me if I were someone else. Genie, I wish to be... a Froot Loop.""

The Genie grants our Cheerio's third and final wish and naffs off on his own life, and our Cheerio's life changes one last time. He loses interest in athleticism and instead takes up acting. Using his fame and fortune from before, he quickly establishes himself in the industry and proves he has what it takes to be the top actor. Years pass, and he becomes the leading star in the big summer blockbuster movie. After the premiere, he attends the afterparty and talks to each of the guests. He sees the Genie at the party and thinks about talking to him, but first, he gets thirsty. So he walks over to get some water, hut there is a line at the water. So he goes to get some lemonade, but there is a line there, too. At last, he goes to get some punch, and there is no punchline.",0

I was driving in the desert in my 1989 Jeep Wrangler.,110,dmpyyj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/dmpyyj/i_was_driving_in_the_desert_in_my_1989_jeep/,26,1571994199.0,"I was going for a drive in the vast, dry deserts of Nevada. I had just gotten in a fight with my wife, and yes, I might have had a little too much to drink and a little too poor a sense of direction to be doing what I was doing. Cacti and tumbleweeds blurred past me as I tried my best to ignore the clunking sound coming out from under the old Wrangler's hood. One stretch of road blended into the next. As the road got bumpier, I realized I wasn't even on a road after all, but rather wandering the desert on an uncharted course.

*SLORTCH!* A sickening crunch sent me and my battered mount spiraling and screeching over the coarse, sandy dunes. Sand got everywhere. The Jeep rammed into a dune with a *THUD* and I blacked out.

*""FOOL OF A CROOK!""* I heard in a thunderous voice. I looked around, panicked. My legs were caught under some Jeep guts that had spilled all over me. I couldn't move. *""Are all you humans this stupid, or are you an extra rare shiny specimen?""*

""What?! Who's there? What's going on?"" was all I could spew from my confused mouth.

*""I am Na'thwhqangq'yi, though those of your kind often call me Nathaniel. Do you not know what you nearly crashed into?""*

Still looking around, I shrugged. ""A wedding party?"" I offered. Out of the corner of my eye, a slimy silver snake slithered silently into view. 

""Ahem. Do you see any extravagant mate pairings in the vicinity? You're hardly doing anyone any favors.""

Staring into his beady little eyes, I was shocked to realize that the voice was coming from the snake! It seemed to be some kind of telepathic ability. Not only that, he had lowered his voice now that he was closer.

""Well, *Nate the Snake,*"" I quipped, ""it's not like you've exactly been handing out favors either! What are you, anyway? Some kind of Area 51 experiment?""

Despite the stupidity of my remarks, I heard something like a muffled chuckle. ""Nate the Snake... I like that. What I am is very old, and beyond your mortal understanding. But I have been imprisoned within this serpentine body for the purpose of guarding the Terminus Obelisk. It is one spoke of a wheel that, when turned, will ignite ancient flames within this planet that will destroy everything on it. And above it. And outside it, in dimensions you cannot imagine.""

""Huh... and what are the other spokes of this wheel? What does that metaphor even mean?"" I asked.

Nate the Snake scoffed. ""It's literally a wheel, pal. See that stick over there? In the mud?""

I looked over at some kind of branch-looking thing protruding from a mud pit nearby. A stick in the mud. 

""I'm not your pal, guy! The name's Jesse. So... you're telling me if I had hit that switch over there, the entire universe and beyond would have ended?""

Nate nodded sagely. ""A stick. A switch. An on/off button for existence, if you will, but more of a lever than a button.""

I snapped ""I'm not Will, I'm Jesse! Pay attention, geez.""

Again, that stupid sexy chuckle. ""Well I'm not Geez, either! Nate the Snake, remember?""

""Right. By the way, help a pal out and get my legs free, please? I'm not a badass snake like you. I really need to pee.""

The car parts holding me down dimly glowed and were lifted from my legs. I thanked Nate heartily and tried to get the Jeep started. No luck.

Finding I was stuck here, in the middle of the desert, I did what any sane man would do: make conversation with Nate the Snake. I found out he'd been guarding this Obelisk thing for centuries. It really didn't look like an ""obelisk"" to me, though, so I just started calling it the Lever of Doom, and it stuck. 

When I got thirsty, Nate was kind enough to lead me to a nearby spring hidden just under a dune that I would have completely missed otherwise. As I drank greedily from the spring, I talked to Nate about my life and my problems.

Despite coming off as a bit of a jerk at first blush, Nate was actually pretty interested in my life. Turns out women in lakes handing out swords is no basis for government, but ancient spirits in snakes handing out advice is an excellent basis for turning your life around. We talked for hours and hours about my wife, Jamie, how all the little times I pissed her off had added up, how she rearranged my things only because she loved me and wanted to clean up the place.

Days passed as I tried to fix the Jeep and failed. No cell reception. I had no idea where the nearest town was. Nate the Snake took pity on me and helped guide me to some wild berries that kept me fed near that mysterious hidden spring. We talked more - about how I felt I was at a dead end at my job, about the career I wanted to pursue and how my manager seemed so much more selfish than other managers in my division. We talked about his abilities, and he showed me some more of the mystical secrets of the desert. He gave me a killer flan recipe. It was all information that I would later take to improve my life immeasurably.

Eventually, I found out what was stopping the Wrangler from starting. With a few zaps from Nate, the engine roared to life.

""I'm going to miss you, Nate the Snake. I feel like we really connected these past few weeks.""

""And I you,"" Nate replied. ""But this needn't be goodbye forever. Return to this desert, take a left, then a right, and repeat. When you are wandering, when you are lost, you can find me and we can chat once more. However, you must promise ne that you will never tell anyone about the Lever of Doom."" 

I took his blessing and warning to heart. Can't believe I even got the old coot to call it the Lever of Doom, too.

And return to him I did. Over the years, as he said, whenever I felt lost in life, I would return to the desert, play the left-right game, and find warm-blooded counsel from Nate. He helped me find solace after my first divorce; he held me stable when the market crashed and I felt totally responsible for it; I bought some guns and helped him defend the Lever of Doom from void-faced legions from Hell. Nate became my dearest friend in life.

One last day, in my hairs of gray, I took one last drive in the deserts of Nevada. I drove my 1989 Jeep Wrangler, repaired multiple times over the years, like I had many times before. As always, I played the left-right game.

I was glad to see Nate's figure in the distance as my Jeep approached. Old friend, one final visit from me.

*Clunk!* 

Uh oh.

That was not a sound my Jeep should have made.

I slammed on the brakes, but nothing happened. The engine roared faster and faster. I was directly on a collision course with the Terminus Obelisk! That stupid little stick in the mud that could destroy the universe. Sweating, I knew I had to make a split second decision... but I knew Nathaniel would never forgive me if I didn't do it.

At the last minute, I swerved into my dearest friend, killing him instantly, and yelled,

*BETTER NATE THAN LEVER!*",110

This tribe are described as being performers of a legendary song and dance unlike any other that has only ever been observed once before. Excited, he studies the remaining few notes of the tribe's whereabouts in the report. After about a month he finally estimates where in Africa this tribe is located and that they should be still around today. A further month of planning comes with him arranging transport, supplies and equipment necessary to document these mysterious people. Then when the day comes and he is on the plane bound for Africa, his mind rushes around thinking about what this strange song and dance these people do. Unfortunately, the plane has an engine malfunction and starts to catch fire in flight!

The anthropologist is lucky enough to grab a parachute and escape through the exit, landing in the middle of nowhere. Days pass and he struggles to find food and water, and his mouth becomes drier and drier and his stomach groans louder and louder. Finally, when it feels like his final hour, he collapses in front of a village, which he recognizes as that of the mysterious tribe! He sees them all stand in the village center ready to perform their act, and despite him feeling his heart beat its final beats, a smile is spread on his face knowing his last moment will be a extraordinary one. The tribe form a circle and begin to sing ""you put your left leg in, your left leg out...""",0

There was this beautiful women assistant behind the counter, and she could see that I was new at it. She handed me a package and asked if I knew how to wear one. I honestly answered, “No, this is my first time.” So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty. “Just a minute,” she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. “Do these excite you?” She asked. Well, I was dumb-struck that all I could do it nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on the desk. “Well come on,” she said , we don’t have much time.” So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.  She looked at me with a bit of a frown. “Did u put that condom on ?” She asked . I said , I sure did”, and held my thumb up to show her.",52

It was the last day of training, right before graduation, when the news came down, one of the cadets was being kicked out. 

By this point they were all already officers, so they let him pick any duty assignment in the air force he wanted... Anything but being a pilot. 

So, given the choice of any post, he considered a post at a large Air Force Base in the desert, with a pool, a movie theater, a gym... Or a post at a smaller base in a big city, where he could go out when off duty and visit the clubs, restaurants, and enjoy the beach...

Finally, he decided. He wanted to be a mobile deployment officer. 

Shocked, they asked him, ""Why? You'll spend all your time either setting up camp, positioning equipment, or breaking down camp and packing up equipment. You'll sleep in tents, and you won't even have a proper shower for weeks.""

He smiled and replied, ""Because thats where the surface to air missiles are. If I'm not gonna fly, no one is.""",23

An atheist dies and goes to hell

The devil welcomes him and says:""Let me show you around a little bit."" They walk through a nice park with green trees and the devil shows him a huge palace. ""This is your house now, here are your keys."" The man is happy and thanks the devil. The devil says:""No need to say thank you, everyone gets a nice place to live in when they come down here!""

They continue walking through the nice park, flowers everywhere, and the devil shows the atheist a garage full of beautiful cars. ""These are your cars now!"" and hands the man all the car keys. Again, the atheist tries to thank the devil, but he only says ""Everyone down here gets some cool cars! How would you drive around without having cars?"".

They walk on and the area gets even nicer. There are birds chirping, squirrels running around, kittens everywhere. They arrive at a fountain, where the most beautiful woman the atheist has ever seen sits on a bench. She looks at him and they instantly fall in love with each other. The man couldn´t be any happier. The devil says ""Everyone gets to have their soulmate down here, we don´t want anyone to be lonely!""

As they walk on, the atheist notices a high fence. He peeks to the other side and is totally shocked. There are people in pools of lava, screaming in pain, while little devils run around and stab them with their tridents. Other devils are skinning people alive, heads are spiked, and many more terrible things are happening. A stench of sulfur is in the air.

Terrified, the man stumbles backwards, and asks the devil ""What is going on there?"" The devil just shrugs and says: ""Those are the christians, I don´t know why, but they prefer it that way"".",4918

The year 2192,5,dmsvps,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/dmsvps/the_year_2192/,2,1572010257.0,"The year is 2192. The British Prime Minister visits Brussels to ask for an extension of the Brexit deadline.  He leaves a ceremonial letter. For reasons lost in time, this letter is always unsigned. Ceremonial garb includes a suit that looks like it was made for a someone of an entirely different size and possibly species, and a blond nylon wig that was placed in a tumble dryer for 30 minutes on the hottest setting. No one remembers where this tradition originated, but every year it attracts many tourists from all over the world.

Increasing the resolution of the picture we see:
Wearing the ceremonial blonde wig and a traditional black outfit with white stockings and with white shirt hanging out the back as though he has only just woken up, the British Prime Minister strides up to the main gates of the EU Council complex in Brussels. The main gates of the complex are shining brightly with gold leaf in the afternoon sun. The EU Council complex sprawls over 95% of the ancient city of Brussels and is resplendent from its pre-occupation renovation; just one of 32 city sized EU Council complexes, one for each of the member states of the Greater Federal European Union, which are occupied for 6 months  once every 16 years. The British Prime Minister carries a large black stick and a scroll tied with a red ribbon. The Prime Minister bangs hard on the gates three times which then swing open to reveal the President of the European Commission, the European Union's Chief Negotiator for the United Kingdom Exiting the European Union and the President of the European Council all wearing their formal and expensively tailored Three Wise Men outfits. The British Prime Minister hands over the scroll, an unsigned letter, requesting an extension to the Brexit deadline for another six months. The Three Wise Men consider the letter carefully and then announce that they will only grant an extension if there is a good reason for it, whereupon they ask the PM for the reason for an extension. The PM formally shrugs his shoulders and says that he doesn’t think there is a good reason. The Three Wise Men consider this carefully and then grant an extension for a further 6 months. The crowd of onlookers  from around the globe cheer loudly and have a great laugh. The crowds of tourists then go and buy food and drink and commemorative presents for their relatives and friends back home. The income from this goes some small way towards offsetting the colossal expense of moving the EU council to a new location every 6 months.

TLDR; Brexit is a joke

So my friend Sam got a job with a large oil company to work oil fields in the Middle East.,8,dmrhnd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/dmrhnd/so_my_friend_sam_got_a_job_with_a_large_oil/,0,1572002260.0,"Once he got to his site, he found he was 35km from the nearest town, no one had a personal vehicle, and the crew was 100% men. All was well for a month or two, but Sam was getting very sexually frustrated. He asked another crew member what they did when they were so horny, and the guy gestures to the camels that were kept nearby, and said that’s what the camels were for. My friend was horrified and would not listen to the other crew member describe just how the camels were used. Another few weeks went by, and Sam began really looking at the camels. Most were smelly and huge, but there was one smaller female that caught his eye. She seemed cleaner, very docile, and had these long eyelashes, with a bit of a coquettish look to her face. Another couple of weeks, and Sam found himself spending quite a bit of his off time grooming and, well, fondling this sweet girl. One night the pent up frustration and easy availability of the camels finally convinced him it would not only be ok, but could actually be a beautiful, mind blowing experience. He brought a short ladder, and led the lovely young lady away from the pack, whispered to her was gonna treat her right, and set up his ladder. But as he began his foreplay, just a little tease with his fingers and hand, she bit, kicked, stomped on him and ran off. When the other guys heard the ruckus, they came running to find my friend, heart broken, bleeding and in shock at the rejection.  He asked the crew what he did wrong, and they said, “well, when we get frustrated, we usually just ride the camels to town.”",8

The young woman’s legs were behind her head as her boyfriend went to town.

Caught in the act, the two stop, and the nurse begs the old woman not to tell. “Please! You know they’ll fire me!”

The old woman stops and thinks. She and her husband haven’t had sex in years. A new position like this could really help get things  going again, so she makes the nurse a deal. “I won’t tell, but you’ve got to train me how to do this, so I can try it with my husband.”

The nurse is skeptical, but desperate to keep her job, she agrees.

For months, the old woman and the nurse practice stretching. Finally after huge effort, the old woman manages to get one leg behind her head.

The two continue practicing. Month after month they work on it, stretching, training, slowly getting better. Finally, one day, the old woman manages to get both legs behind her head.

That night, finally ready to surprise her husband with her new ability, the old woman strips down and hops on her bed to get ready for when he returned to their room.

Slowly, slowly she puts one leg behind her head. Slowly, slowly she puts the other one up, too. 

She hears her husband at the door, but in her excitement she slips and rolls on to her back.

Her husband enters the room and finds her in this position and says,

“Oh for godssakes, Margaret, put your teeth back in. You look like an asshole.”",4

“Doctor,” he asked, in total frustration, “is there anything you can do for me?”

The doctor replies, “Medically son, there is nothing I can do.  But, I do know this witch who may be able to help you.”

So the doctor gives him directions to the witch.

The man calls upon the witch and relays his story. “Witch, my penis is 25 inches long and I need help.  Can anything be done to help me?  You’re my last hope!”

The witch stares in amazement, scratches her head, and then replies, “I think I may be able to help you.

Do this.  Go deep into the forest.  You will find a pond.  In this pond, you will find a frog sitting on a log.  This frog has magic.  You say to the frog, will you marry me?  When the frog says no, you will find five inches less to your problem.”

The man’s face lit up and he dashed off into the forest.

He called out to the frog, “Will you marry me?”

The frog looked at him dejectedly and replied, “NO.”

The man looked down and suddenly his penis was 5 inches shorter.

“WOW,” he screamed out loud, “This is great!”

But at 20 inches it was still too long, so he asked the frog again.  “Frog, will you marry me?” the guy shouted.

The man felt another twitch in his penis, looked down, and it was another 5 inches shorter.

The man laughed, “This is fantastic.”

He looked down at his penis again, 15 inches long, and reflected for a moment.  15 inches is still a monster, just a little less would be ideal.

Grinning, he looked across the pond and yelled out, “Frog will you marry me?”

“I’m not eating that!” Says a disgusted Edward. 
“Aye it’s covered in maggots!” Replied Jock. 
Paddy however shrugged and said “beggars can’t be choosers lads!” And devoured the lot. 
After several more hours of trudging through the jungle the men find a nest full of human eyeballs. Edward dry heaves while a shocked Jock proclaims “some bird must have collected them from the dead in the crash” and says a quiet prayer. Paddy however, completely unperturbed, grabbed a handful and gobbled them right up, “well they’re not using them now!” He said. 
The men carry on their search for aid through the jungle and suddenly hear the sound of running water. Elated, a parched Edward and Jock rush towards the sound. Paddy however, rubs his belly thinking he’s getting hungry again, strolls casually behind. He follows the men and comes across Jock kneeling beside a river consoling a screaming Edward. 
“What’s happened here!?” Asks Paddy. 
“Edward went to take a drink from the river! But as soon as he put his hands in a piranha latched onto his finger and bit it off!” Cries Jock. 
Looking around, Paddy sees the fish flopping around on the ground. He walks over, picks up a rock and cracks it over the head. Then without missing a beat he devours the whole thing! 
“YOU BASTARD!” Screams Edward. “My finger was in there!” 
“Sure I thought it was a bit chewy.” Chuckled Paddy. 
Then all of a sudden a jeep burst through the brush with “RED CROSS” plastered across the side of it. Medics jumped out and ran across to tend to the three men. Patching up Edward’s hand, and treating other wounds on them. 
“Alright. Let’s get out of here” said the medic in charge. “You guys must be starving, there’s some food in the jeep!” Jock and Edward begin to cry with delight, thanking the medics.

Looking for Love,6,dmi2sd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/dmi2sd/looking_for_love/,6,1571959982.0,"Alladeen was the third son of a wealthy oil sheikh. When he reached his twentieth year, his father commanded him to take a wife, but after numerous sumptuous matchmaking banquets he still hadn't found a woman that stirred his passion.

Tired of failure, and fearing that his father would make the choice for him if he dallied, Alladeen started mingling with the common people at his father's hotels. Night after night, he trolled the lobbies and casinos, until finally he saw Her.

The instant he laid eyes upon her, he knew he would love no other as long as he lived. She was obviously foreign - blonde and fit, with porcelain skin and a perfect face. Alladeen approached this vision of beauty and they hit it off immediately, laughing and talking late into the night as though they had known each other for years rather than hours.

Samantha was everything he needed, everything he wanted - but she defied every one of Allah's precepts. She wore revealing clothing, confided in Alladeen that she'd had a dozen sexual partners (both men and women) and clearly spent a lot of time every morning styling her hair and applying makeup.

Samantha returned to Alladeen's room every night for weeks.  When his father discovered the relationship, he was furious. He had armed guards drag her out of the hotel, and ordered Alladeen never to see her again.

Alladeen took his private funds and fled. He spent days searching for his lost love, but the city was vast and as days passed his hope dimmed. Eventually, he hired a team of private investigators to track her down.

Girls With Big Tits.,7845,dlf7c6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/dlf7c6/girls_with_big_tits/,199,1571763666.0,"When I was 13, I hoped that one day I would have a  beautiful girlfriend with big tits. When I was 16, I got a girlfriend with big tits, but there was no passion, so I decided I needed a passionate girl with zest for life. 

In college I dated a passionate girl, but she was too emotional. Everything was an emergency; she was a drama queen, cried all the time and threatened suicide. So I decided I needed a girl with stability. 

When I was 25, I found a very stable girl but she was boring. She was totally predictable and never got excited about anything. Life became so dull that I decided I needed a girl with some excitement. 

When I was 28, I found an exciting girl, but I couldn't keep up with her. She rushed from one thing to another, never settling on anything. She did mad impetuous things and made me miserable as often as happy. She was great fun initially and very energetic, but directionless. So I decided to find a girl with some real ambition. 

When I turned 30, I found a smart ambitious girl with her feet planted firmly on the ground, so I married her. She was so ambitious that she divorced me and took everything I owned. 

I am older and wiser now, and I am looking for a beautiful girlfriend with big tits.",7845
