Please stop trying to police users from using our sub to ask their questions and please stop trying to moderate the front page just because you *personally feel* that you’ve seen similar questions recently. We are an open Q&A sub, and we encourage discussion. Users ask questions for a variety of reasons, we aren’t here to shame them for asking their questions or for feeling how they feel and attacking them for stating it. We are here to answer and civilly discuss why we feel the way we do. We are all complex and have our own opinions and understandings of topics, if you can’t contribute anything relevant, scroll past the question. 

Going forward there will be a new report option for reporting comments that violate this rule and **mods will investigate from context if there is any issue**. We still want to encourage users to discuss and sometimes linking outside sources or bringing up other posts interwoven in can make a good discussion a great discussion, we will always value that. We are more so concerned with the users who solely tell other users to search it up or shame users for asking. “Seriously, you’re afraid to ask this??”

Additionally, users who clog the mod mail with messages to us about why we are allowing X post when Y post exists or that it’s easy enough to google have received a warning, but future messages to the mods in this manner will be punished the same as above.

The last 5 years it has put my life in danger because of all the suicidal thoughts I have. I have tried everything. 7 therapists, 3 antidepressants, Xanax, medical marijuana, healthy and unhealthy coping skills (art, writing, impulse shopping, self harm, to name a few) but nothing helps the depression go away, not even a little. Sure, i still laugh and smile, I sometimes feel optimistic, but i am not happy. Smiling and laughing a couple times a day, or having hope for a few minutes, doesnt mean someone is truly happy. I am tired of ephemeral happiness. But maybe I'm just not grateful enough for being able to feel it at all. I could be so much worse...

Talking about my problems in therapy makes me feel worse because I'm trying to focus on the positive, I don't find it helpful to always talk about what's wrong. My therapists haven't been so helpful either, they never seemed to focus on my problems, and if they did, I was shamed or talked over. Antidepressants made my life a living hell and I will never consider going back on them again. Xanax doesn't effect me when I take It, it's as if my body treats it like a sugar pill. Nothing happens. Medicinal marijuana helps with my PTSD, anxiety, insomnia, and chronic pain, but not my depression. Coping skills distract me but the feelings always cone back.

I want the pain to stop. I am so tired everyday, physically and mentally. I am traumatised from recent events, which is making me more depressed, and the fact I cannot stop thinking about what happened to me doesn't help. I can't deal with my own head anymore. I feel like a shell of a human being, a shell that is surviving, and not living. I hardly smile or frown. I move and think slowly. All i want to do is sleep. I can barely eat anymore. I cannot see a future for myself (I'm almost 20), and when I really try hard to see what my life could be like in the next 10 years I see a bad future or I see blackness, nothingness. I have goals but no way to reach them because they're too far fetched for my living & financial situation. I almost don't want to get better, I almost don't want to be happy or even content with life. I just don't want to exist anymore. So many people have told me ""You dont want to truly die, you just don't want to be in pain anymore,"" but there are times where I simply do Not. Want. To. Feel. ANYTHING. Including positive feelings. I constantly think about death, dying, whether it be myself or other people. I can't take it anymore.

How come I was physically and emotionally abused by my parents for the past 20 years but still love them?,2,dq9chf,https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/dq9chf/how_come_i_was_physically_and_emotionally_abused/,10,1572666614.0,"Emotional abuse, physical abuse, you name it I’ve been through it. 

My parents did show me love but they also abused me in their own special way : guilt tripping, threatening to disown me, “if you do X your dad/mom will die of sadness” etc...

Now let’s talk about physical abuse : I remember being 8 years old when I was running during the school break until I tripped and fell, I ended up hurting my knees.


Now how would a normal dad react? Don’t ask me, my dad was waiting outside to take me back home, he pressed on the back of my neck while I was crying in pain (not from the knee wound lol) for 1 mile on the way back home, he didnt stop !


And I remember being hit when I was 11 with a belt for a stupid minor mistake, he hit me as hard as he could, long story short the metallic buckle landed on my balls.

The list goes on and on but you get the point.

I do admit that I wasn’t and I’m still not the perfect child, and that I make mistakes, but I wonder how the hell do I still love my parents and I don’t hate them for everything they’ve done to me? How am I not even considering it abuse? Is this a form of Stockholm syndrome? Do I have to run away ?


P.S : yes they still abuse me, emotionally more than physically. We’re in good terms and “happy smiling loving family” as long as I do what they want me to do.",2

However, John also likes to wear a full face of makeup, dresses, skirts, lipstick, tights, etc. He is also pre-surgery and does not wear a binder.

I try to scream, but I can’t. He loses his balance and falls off my bed to the ground by my wardrobe. I open my eyes (and know I’m awake at this point), and he’s still there.

I constantly meet new people while on the job so reality hits me only when not working.(that I have no single close friend).

No one invites me but honestly Even I don't know when I am free from work...

I constantly confuse myself if I am self-diagnosing wrongly or not..
Being a Capricorn I put work ahead of everything.
Any work I recieve is keeping me away from people that matter---Friends..

How does one object to tip culture without screwing over the workers who rely on it?,6,dpobb7,https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/dpobb7/how_does_one_object_to_tip_culture_without/,52,1572560912.0,"I don't know where to post this. Posting this here because I don't know who to ask this to without seeming like a jerk.

I do not approve of tipping. I feel as though I should not have to tip for basic services of a job description. Tipping is for going above and beyond your job description.

For example, delivery drivers. Your job is to literally transport food fram your place of work to my house. Why should I have to tip for that? That is literally what you were hired to do. This infuriates me even more when there is a delivery fee. I am essentially paying three times to get delivery (cost of product, delivery fee, and tip). Now, if a place does not deliver but ends up delivering to me for whatever reason I would tip the hell out of that because that is going above and beyond.

I do not blame the drivers or waitress staff themselves. A lot of them are paid very little and rely on tips. That is wrong but it currently is the way it is. I do not want to screw over them who are innocent in this tipping conundrum but I do want to object to the tipping culture. A lot of capitalism is 'voting with your wallet' which I feel if I withold the tip I will not hurt the millionaires and billionaires but I will hurt the people barely scraping by.

Run away
Break up immediately
Get counseling because all people with this illness are abusive

I have also been rejected as a candidate for a job because of my illness despite it having no impact on work performance. Since being denied this job, mental health has since never been an interview question (I didn't lie about it, but I would now). So I do not want to google this ever again, I've seen enough.

When I talk about it with my friends they either say that they rarely ever remember their dreams or that they usually just have short dreams before they wake up that are related to their morning routine (I have those too sometimes but I'm not talking about those). If someone does mention their dreams they usually say that some character in their dreams says something mildly strange and kind of out of line but other than that it seems to be a pretty comprehensible experience to them. Meanwhile, I could easily come up with a hand full of dreams that were very vivid and packed with strange stuff and random events that I could never come up with. I am often in very open and threatening scenarios and it often ends with either me dying or someone else close to me dying. I am just thrown in these situations without even questioning it and just proceed to play along but every time I wake up I wanna bang my head against the wall because of how stupid I was for not even noticing what kind of wack bullshit I just went through

Also, is it normal for you that when you're in a dream and you randomly ask yourself the question ""could this be a dream?"" you always come to the conclusion that this is in fact a dream? I used to have a lot of lucid dreams because of that but I couldn't really control them like everyone says. I often try to fly in them but all I can really do is jump a little higher. I am also unable to make other things happen the way I want to. For example (NSFW Incoming) I kinda wanted to have sex in one dream but everybody I wanted to do it with was against me and just walked away from me. I am however able  to sometimes trick my brain in some lucid dreams by pretending to hypnotise the people in the dream to bend more to my will or craft myself a jetpack with which I could jump a lot higher (but not quite fly but it was a pretty freeing experience and I managed to remember that trick for two other dreams). Strange stuff still continues to happen though and in some cases (doesn't even have to be a lucid dream) I run into pitch black places and scream, which makes me wake up. I kind of have the feeling that maybe I don't 100% trust that I am in a lucid dream and therefor also can't 100% decide what happens but that's just an idea honestly.

Could someone with similar experience or someone who knows more about this topic offer their opinion on this?

Thanks in advance!

Earlier it was on Sept. last week when I went to my previous gym. There I didn't hired any personal trainer and scheduled my workout routine according to the best I could find over the Internet. I also got sick on Sept. so I didn't had much experience in the gym.

So yesterday when I went to this new gym (it's free trial for 3 days), I decided to do push exercises (which involves pushing using chest, shoulders and Triceps). I first met a trainer, he was calm and polite. He asked me which body part I'm gonna hit today? I said chest, shoulders, and triceps. He was a bit surprised and replied that will I be able to hit all those muscle groups on a single day. I said yes bcoz I had been doing this when I was going to my last gym.

Then he told me some warm ups. Then I did bench press. Now I never did bench press with a barbell I only did it with dumbbells. And the weight of barbell rod alone was 20kgs which I never lifted before. But I wanted to try. I did the bench press. Then I went for decline bench press. While doing the second set I got so tired that I was not able to put the rod on place. Another trainer saw me and helped me. Then I did other workouts and this other trainer was constantly staring me. Finishing chest, I already had my triceps sore and then I went for shoulders. I saw the machine but didn't knew how to adjust it for shoulder press. The other trainer came and I asked for adjusting the machine. He told me how to adjust it. I then started working out but he was standing near by. I unfortunately didn't lifted much as my triceps were already sore. He then said I was before doing chest, now shoulder, why? I said that's the target to hit each muscle group twice a week. He asked who told me this. I said I heard it. ( didn't wanted to get into much detail of what I learnt on YouTube). He asked me about my previous gym. He then asked my why I left. I explained about the crowd. He then asked me how long did I lift. I said 2 months. He said how long it had been since I last lifted. I said 1 month. He asked why. I said I had to go to other city. He asked me why I went to other city. I said to meet my brother. He said where I my brother. I told the city. He asked what is he doing there. I told Mtech. He asked Institute. I told the institute. Then he started telling me that I should not hit two muscles. Like look you can't even lift. Then he said you came to this gym, here we won't give you any supplements, injections. ( I didn't said but neither did my previous gym do this). Then he preached me a lot. I was sitting on the machine turned my head and listening to him. He told that he don't want to demotivate me but he was telling it in a way that made me feel bad. Then I told why can't we hit chest and Triceps together bcoz afterall when you hit chest you also activate triceps. He laughed like I'm a fool. He said keep on doing what Im doing and meet him later. I felt as if I said something very silly and so he laughed in a way to indirectly communicate that I'm silly.
I then did some exercises but as my triceps were sore I stopped and took my bag from the locker. He then stopped me to talk. He took me to reception. Then he said me to go and see the chart which on the wall. Then he said did you read how to exercise. I just nodded as I was not interested to listen to him. He then said went you will gain enough strength then you go for hitting two muscle groups a day. I found his way of talking very dominating and as if like he wanted only himself to speak not to listen to me. Then I just went from the gym. And since then I found myself sad and unhappy and unmotivated.
I'm 19/M.

If you read till here, then I'm very thankful of you.
Can you please tell me should I join this gym or not?

What I found was a significant portion of the comments (from black women) encouraging black women to explore relationships outside their black community.

I was sitting in cooking class watching master chef because we had nothing else to do. Then, this one guy just lays down on the ground... Behind my desk. It was strange, but I didn't think much of it. I had a math quiz the next class, so I had to study rather than wonder why the hell someone is laying on the floor behind me.

Then the weird part happened. I felt a little tap on my caboose, and I jolted forward. I didn't expect it to happen. I looked behind, and I saw the same guy pull his arm back as fast as he could, but I SAW HIM!

I said quietly ""What the fuck? I don't feel comfortable sitting here anymore. I'm gonna go to that seat over there"". I shouldn't have said that, right now, I have a huge feeling that I should've stomped on his nose and jam it into his skull, I mean, it only takes 2 pounds of force to do so, and I can stomp on someone way more powerful than 2 pounds. I work out on a treadmill at maximum incline every day, I'm not saying I'm buff, in fact, I'm kinda flabby, but one thing I do know is that my legs are slightly above average. My arms need work though.

PUTTING THAT ASIDE... I felt so embarrassed, and I felt violated. I was a coward for just sitting at another desk. I'm usually the kind of person to face his problems head on no matter the consequences, not ignore the situation.

What should I do? This guy has done creepy things to me in a few different ways. The one I remember the most is when I was sitting on a bench after P.E. alone in the hallway, he decided to sneak up on me and sit on my lap making ""noises"". I ended up hitting him in the back of the head, I've never punched anyone so hard, actually. But that was in seventh grade! It's not like he's frequently doing weird things to me.",5

He gets so close I always kinda lean backwards so my face is further away, it's not super close but definitely not my comfortable zone - about 50 cm or less, also he is overweight and his stomach ends up touching me. He also does that while we sit in classes, he takes most of the space and when I tell him to move a little bit he does it and then goes back unintentionally I think. Today we were standing and talking on a break, usually we talk near windowsills( where I lean backwards since there is no space to move away ) but this time we were in middle of the corridor, when he got close I stepped away and he almost instantly got close again, I did it few more times and we got to the windowsills. Also many times before I told him to move away and that he is too close but it wasn't 100% direct, something like - "" can you move away a little "".

 I don't know what can I do at this point to make him notice that it makes me and most people uncomfortable how close he gets and it's better to keep around 1m distance, even if you're good friends it doesn't mean that you literally have to stick to each other when talking ...",1

We left the bar together as she was going home and I was heading downtown to another bar, with a few friends. Not sure if she was interested in anything more right then and there, but what may have been due to my lack of experience with girls and being a bit drunk we ended up parting ways. 

She'd told me she was going to be at the campus bar's last open day, which I'd wanted to go to, but since I had an exam the next day I couldn't. 

I wasn't going to be in town during the summer and since I live on the other end of the country I figured there wasn't any point in adding her then. Now it's October and I've been back for a few months, but I've literally had no spare time, so I'd been thinking it's best to wait. 

I finally have some freetime and expect the next couple of classes to be a bit easier on the schedule, leaving room for potential dating.

But the question is if I've waited for too long and if it would just be weird to try and get in touch with her, 5 months later?

TL;DR

Spent 2 hours talking to a girl at the campus bar.
Haven't seen her for 5 months.

And surely there would be a counterpart to sexual objectification, but this time it refers to their personality. 

Nobody in the history of the world would ever say that women LITERALLY don’t have a personality. When appreciating sexualized advertising, every single person knows there is a personality behind it, but it’s just completely irrelevant. To me, sexual objectification would be “yeah she’s nice but I don’t give a shit I just want to fuck her brains out”. So what am I missing?

I have thyroid issues as it is but before I was diagnosed with that, I had a very bad relationship with a guy who felt like I owed him sex and he had the right to step out if I didn't give it to him how he wanted it.

Anyway, that was for six years and we broke up almost three years ago. Every since I first started having sex with him, I feel as though I've lost my ability to become aroused (so, going on 10 years now). Although I have become aroused a few times (I mean a few), I have not been able to determine where it came from. I'm usually alone when I'm aroused and when I do have sex, I find it very hard to not let my mind wander to other things while having sex, and do not feel like I can focus on if the sex feels good or not. 

I know that I need to talk to a doctor about this, and have tried. But the extent of what I am saying is not something I feel is possible with a gynecologist or even a GP. Even the sex therapists I've seen have told me they don't think I am going to get much out of therapy (because I clam up). I can't help it, I don't know how to say these things to people, even professionals. I give up and just deal with it.

The last time I went to the doctor, it was because my vagina was bleeding after sex. I had sex with my now husband (fiance at the time) and even though I used lube, it felt like nothing. I felt like my vagina just sucked it up or something. That's sounds so weird but it didn't help at all. The next day, I tried again and it hurt so bad that I couldn't do it. It was worse than losing my virginity. It felt like the hole was too small to be penetrated. My doctor gave me some antibiotic cream and told me not to have sex for a week, etc.

Since then, no major issues but I experience the rubbed raw sensation every time we have sex, and that actually isn't often. Maybe like one a month if even. Anyway, besides talking to my doctor, what's going on? It's causing me terrible distress and unfulfillment. I know my hormones are off but I am at a loss. I don't really know what to do.",4

Women’s Halloween costumes and their “sexy” this or that outfits. Recently someone I know dressed up as a black cat (classic ik) in a rather showy outfit. Tight fitting, really low cut dress with cat tights, Tall boots, etc. Before she decided the cat idea, she didn’t have any ideas and figured to dress up as a “slut” as she said. But I couldn’t help but think how her boyfriend would think. 

I’m not against women who want to be confident and sexy for Halloween. I know she didn’t show to the event purposefully to hook up with guys. And I’m aware clothes don’t mean consent or are invitations to being open to relationships, etc. 

However, as a woman who’s in a relationship to a guy, I would not dare to dress up “sexy” in front of others as I haven’t even done something bold like that for my bf. Maybe it’s just because I don’t like dressing up in that way and have less confidence; I’m not a person to wear things that stick out or reveal a lot of skin, esp publicly.

So I find it hard to wrap my head around this. I don’t think as her boyfriend he should be mad and demand “you can’t do that.” But for me; its just the impression that’s given off by wearing something sexy, is conflicting to me. Could it just be for self confidence?  Just “cause”? Or “for fun”?

* Psychotherapy is talk therapy, and I've heard it's very effective. So what do they say? What makes talking to them different than talking to someone who isn't a psychiatrist?
* I'm sometimes too blunt or unaware of things you shouldn't say, etc. Is how to not do that covered, or does that just mean psychiatry is not for me?
* What's the doctor-patient relationship like? How would the psychiatrist usually react if a patient died?
* Do psychiatrists listen to your breathing, test your reflexes/vision etc like the doctor would when you go for a checkup? Do nurses see you at first when you go for a session?

And before you reply with ""Future? We already live in it"", read the rest of the post.
Yes, one way or another it has always been the few and powerful to be in command. But up until, I wanna say, the last 20 years, people in a first world country could, with effort, topple a government they didn't want.

But think about the future. The wealth gap between social classes will only get larger, while automation will ensure that the means of productions will be controlled by fewer and fewer people. Meanwhile, military technology progresses foward. 30 years ago a mob armed with firearms was a threat. Now a first world dictator could wipe it out with a drone strike before it even assembles. He wouldn't even need an army.

Also, quality of life in the west, has reached a point where we can pretty much take our sustenance and safety for granted. This means that uprisings against an unjust or totalitarian government due to desperate conditions will be less likely. Even in a full on dystopia people will be cozy and comfortable.

What I'm saying is that the average citized will have less and less power to act in defense of its own rights, thanks to the ever increasing wealth gap and the technology that can be put to use with it, together with its own complacency and other frustration outlets.

So, is this the destiny of our society? I'm honestly scared to ask this. Hoping I can be proven wrong.",4

I ask because I've never been in a relationship and I'm not sure what is normal. Do couples message constantly through out the day, one or twice a day? What is considered too much or too little? I know every relationship is different and people are different. Another reason I ask is because when I start talking to someone, at first its constant messaging back and forth, but then it slows down. I know the constant back and forth can't go on forever, but is it normal for it to slow down that much. For example I was talking to a girl and for the first month we talked everyday all day long. Even when she was a work or whatever she had going on she would message me up until she or I fell asleep at night. Now she does text me still, but it's less frequently. And she stops texting me at night pretty early. I guess I feel like she's lost interest or is just not that into it anymore. Again, I've never had a relationship before so I'm not sure what normal is with a lot of stuff pertaining to relationships. Because of that and other stuff that's happened in the past I feel like I'll always be interesting to somebody initially, but not interesting enough for  an actual relationship. Every encounter I've had has only lasted at most a couple months. After that they seem to lose interest. That with a few other things has taken a toll on my self esteem.

What's crackalackin' everybody?,6,dp1bpe,https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/dp1bpe/whats_crackalackin_everybody/,5,1572435082.0,"Sorry for the off topic title, I just didn't know how to start this post. Figured I'd try to get the people who don't end up clicking the post to smile.

I need help. I'm not depressed or sad or anything. I'm 16 and I'm trying to live my best life, but since I took on that philosophy 5 years ago, it seems like that has begun to be more and more impossible. I started by indulgence, you know, food, video games, other stuff. It was good while it lasted, but, of course, it didn't last long. I came to this wierd resting place where indulgence didn't have any effect on me anymore, but I also had no idea what to do. I later came to the conclusion that my life, despite its inherent meaninglessness, would only become worth living if I had some form of a direction, so I started doing lots of schoolwork to go to college and eventually try to contribute something to society. I briefly became obsessed with being remembered, but decided that it didn't matter that much or that it was all the same in the end. That led me to where I am now, where I'm in a pursuit of meaning, and the temporary one I have strapped to myself is trying to do as much good as I possibly can, but also deciding what is really good or bad. I've been led to believe that I am not good, even though I'm really trying to be, and that I don't deserve what I have. 

In line with all of this, my brain has seemed to converge on suicide. When I was 12, I think I considered it maybe once, but now it seems to be a weekly occurrence. What's really holding me back is the FOMO, but also what unnecessary sadness I might cause. So my final question is why don't I, if I die in 50 years or in 50 days, what does it all matter if I decide to die today?

I feel like I should clarify that I'm not trying to act pretentious or like I have some hidden knowledge. I just want an opinion on whether or not it would be worth it, kind of like reaffirmation that maybe I'll one day be happy or have a reason to live. Thank you.",6

I don't have many friends in the hobbies i participate in because i'm a recluse and don't put too much effort into going places, so i only end up going to the gym and at work.  I don't go to bars, clubs, etc.

I work as an aide in a health department and got into an interesting discussion with one of the patients.  She was maybe 50 years old and i'm 30.  I like to make light to deep conversation during the work day because it makes it go by faster and it also satiates my need to connect with people.  I don't have any ulterior motives.  I remember this lady said mid convo ""i have kids your age......."" and it seemed to come out of nowhere, but it didn't occur to me until later that she might've thought that i was hitting on her which is a common reaction that i get from women when i  honestly am just into the discussion.  I'm not flirting/winking/touching, literally just asking questions and talking about interests.  I have the same convo with guys as well, IDGAF, but guys seem more open to this than women (at least with me and not noticing the pure intention).  Her son does the same kind of music i do (so she told me), so me being passionate about music, wanted to get his contact info from her.

So the next time i see her, i gave her my business card and told her to email me or text me her sons contact info and she kinda paused and never ended up contacting me.  I decided to give her my card because i didn't want to be too invasive asking for her number.

Another incident, me and another female were having an interesting conversation about music and i asked her if she dances to which she staunchly and very seriously replied, ""NO."" just then, another female coworker slips in the fact that she has a boyfriend in the conversation and i realized they probably thought i was gonna ask her out to go dancing or something, when i was just discussing another passion of mine that was connected to music (which we were talking about).

I am at the point where I may just stop even having these discussions with females in the work place, because it seems like i'm either giving off the wrong vibes or they're interpreting me wrong and I don't want to see HR over harmless discussions.  Am i oblivious or just misunderstood?  How should I go about this to make them KNOW i am not hitting on them?  Should I slip in the fake fact that i have a girlfriend in the convos so they know i'm taken and not trying anything?  The fact that I may not be able to have these conversations in the same place where i spend the majority of my time kinda depresses me and kills my soul a bit to be honest.",2

People are quick to write off a candidate purely based on the party they are running with or lack of exposure. They say “this person doesn’t have a chance, im not even gonna bother listening to what they have to say”.

I’m asking this because I follow a bunch of rate me type subs (rateme, truerateme, amiugly), etc, and I’ve noticed a pattern. 


Normally when I look at a post of someone, I kind of guess what others would rate them based on things like acne, hair, proportion, symmetry, bone structure, etc. And more times than not, I can guess pretty decently close to the average of the comments.


Sometimes I’m off, but it’s understandable since beauty is in the eyes of the beholder and others might see people as more beautiful as I do. 


BUT, every time a black guy makes a post, It’s ALWAYS higher than I think. Now please keep note, I have nothing against black people, nor do I always think “oh he’s black, he must be ugly”, BUT a lot of the time, just like anyone else, they might be lacking certain features that would bring them up to a certain letter. Sometimes they have a big forehead, low or not pronounced cheek bones, not a strong brow bone, lacking symmetry, but somehow they get the same rating as someone who has all of those features. 


I would like to repeat, I’m not racist and try to look at every post objectively as possible, but it seems being black brings up your attractiveness - so much to the point if your black and have a bland face, you’ll get rated the same as someone who’s white with a structures and developed face.


Maybe because everyone has their own judgements and opinions, mine is just different, but even truerateme, who’s supposed to be extremely objective and strict, this still happens.

"I want to be enlightened: What rationale separates whitewashing roles formerly played by people of color, from casting POC in formerly white roles and to call it representation?",0,dowgto,https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/dowgto/i_want_to_be_enlightened_what_rationale_separates/,3,1572412811.0,"I realize this has a tendency to be a hot-button issue, I'm just really eager to learn from others the line of reasoning in the public responses to these instances of casting against a character's original race.

I have observed the issue divide to be present in the form of praising choices of casting POC actors in roles originally recognized as white.

see: Halle Bailey as Ariel in the new *The Little Mermaid*; Michael B. Jordan as Johnny Storm in *Fantastic Four (2015)*; one could even pose the argument for Noma Dumezweni as Hermione in the theatrical production of *The Cursed Child*.

My own beliefs are firmly in the camp of celebrating instances like these, where racial ""barriers"", so to speak, can be brought down and any actor can have a shot at engaging with a role in their own way. 

What I am eager to learn more about is the seemingly contradictory public reaction when the situation is paralleled. That is to say, when white actors are cast in roles originally recognized as persons of color.

see: Scarlett Johansson in *Ghost in the Shell (2017)*; Tom Cruise in *Edge of Tomorrow (2014)*, who portrays a character originally of Japanese descent in the novel; Natalie Portman and Jennifer Jason Leigh in *Annihilation (2018)*, who are both Ashkenazi Jewish playing characters described in the books as Asian and half Native American, respectively.

I think it's worth noting that I understand the praise and protest to these casting choices respectively, as individually they are either instances of casting for diversity and representation, or whitewashing of characters originally recognized as persons of color. 

I guess my lack of understanding comes to down to the issue of the same principle in casting decisions being this: ""Actor of [A] ethnicity is cast as a character of [B] ethnicity. This is a good thing / this is a bad thing"".

As I type this out, I feel like I somehow already know the answer to my question, but I would love to hear the input of someone who can maybe structure the explanation in a more comprehensive way than I can in my own head.

Please don't mistake my ignorance on the issue as disagreement that whitewashing is a bad thing. I think I'm just trying to find a better way to formally express the beliefs I've described above in a comprehensive way.",0

Should we break up?,2,doqan9,https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/doqan9/should_we_break_up/,10,1572386765.0,"I (23f) am dating someone (33f) and I've caught myself being, what i think, is emotionally abusive. I don't mean to but I'm always being set off by the tiniest things. Things I think are important but she doesn't. 

I've just moved 5 hours from my partner for family reasons and I think this is a red flag for me to work on myself. My partner has not been coping with it, which I understand, it was hard for us both. To the point where my partner has been reaching out to others and telling them an abridged version of what happen. I found out today my partner has been saying that I'm shit and I abandoned her and followed it by telling me she hurt herself. 

I was scared, worried for my partner but so angry about it but I didn't say much, just offered some scarce words of encouragement. I couldn't bring myself to sympathise and I feel horrible, my commitment was only 4 words of encouragement and an apology. 

I sat on it and what i would say to her. I rehearsed scenarios over in my head until i felt sick. I spoke to her on the phone and it wasn't true. She'd never hurt herself. She'd told me she quit her job, it wasnt true.

My biggest fear is knowing she is in a terrible place emotionally.

I got angry again and I feel like a child. I made her cry, I kept digging and digging at it. I couldn't drop it, all my anger just exploded. Knowing how emotionally unstable she is, why couldn't I just shut up? 

All her friends are distrustful of me despite never having met me but mine dislike her and it's turned into a mess. I feel like it's time to break up but she's just in this place where I feel like it's my responsibility to pull her through but isn't that just going to make it worse?

Should I cut my losses and fuck everyone up now or do I stay and potentially find myself repeating the cycle of hurt or am I the problem?",2

Do Asian people know boundaries and personal space?,4,domrld,https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/domrld/do_asian_people_know_boundaries_and_personal_space/,6,1572365486.0,"My sample size is quite large so I am not just claiming something from a few cases. I am not generalizing or being racist either. So let's just move on from that. It's just something I don't understand and I need to know if it's just those that I have experience with or if this is something I am not aware of as I am not asian.

A little explanation; I'm from england and I am currently an immigrant in europe. I have been in immigration integration courses for about 2 years and it's wonderful, I love learning and meeting new people, learning the language alongside people from all over the world. And this is where my question comes in. 

A lot of asian immigrants that I have spent time around, don't seem to respect boundaries. I have met Vietnamese, Japanese, Chinese, Indian Iraqi and Pakistanis, so I am truly trying not to generalise or offend. 

I have noticed that these particular people don't have as strong boundary or privacy beliefs that I have. They will stand behind me when I am working at my desk, far too close and for far too long, just looking over my shoulder at my work. When I am in conversation with someone else i will notice that they stand uncomfortably close and just stare at the conversation. If I am in conversation with someone who is asian, they will stand too close, be far too loud and touch me in some ways. I have noticed that once I become friendly with someone like this, they begin to touch me and invade my privacy more, random hugs or arms around my shoulders, head touches and the like. 

Is this some sort of cultural difference I am not aware of? As a British person, I sometimes cannot handle this and want to just push them away or tell them to stop, but i don't want to be insensitive and make them feel judged for something they probably don't see a problem with. If this is normal behaviour then i shall hold back. I just need some sort of reasoning or explanation as this is baffling to me....",4

Every little detail has to be exactly how I imagine it in my head. Obviously, that means I waste a lot of time finding these things.

I also get off to committing crimes. I mean if you and I were to rob a bank right now and get away with it, I'd be absolutely thrilled (and pleasured). I have literally vandalized buildings and stolen things that are completely meaningless to me, just because it was challenging and I could get off to it.

UPDATE: I saw a psychiatrist or whatever. She said though I show signs of Psychopathy, PTSD, and OCD, I am not being diagnosed with any of those things!

He’s so good in bed but he can’t commit. Last summer I went London, to holiday &amp;amp; somehow “visit him”. We had good time, I stay at his place all the time, you can see my post, it’s all about him. I am into this man. Really. But back then when we were together he gave me sign that he won’t get married, won’t have kids. He’s 40-ish by the way. Sigh. And I’m on my early adults. I’m fresh 21. Yes, I’m a bit turned off by his statement that he won’t getting married etc BUT it’s clear that we FWB. Period. We are a FUCK buddy. Period. I’m 100% OKAY with that. With our age distance &amp;amp; principal in life... I’m ok. 
He just don’t want to admit. 
• 
Yesterday he called me, and say thank you for being nice that I NEVER getting mad whenever he’s not there... in means that he always off, he barely text me, he’s a man that barely text, you know, he can be gone for 2-3 weeks.. and call me just one day, asking how am I doing, bla bla... (because he’s always traveling). 
He told me I’m the nicest woman in the world, because never being poses about where he is.... lol. I’m not that type because I know where we stand, I’m still young better filled my time with useful things in life rather than worrying about love, man, &amp; bullshits.
• 
He’s not my ride or die, he left me all the time, barely help me on my worse days....
I never asked him to be always there, but he must understand, I have my life too. I think it’s “our” fault because we never talk about it - as I don’t know where is this going and just assume.
Yesterday He kept asking when we will meet next.  I do want to meet him, but his schedule and crazy expectations for me to travel Cairo, Dubai at my age with my own expanses is CRAZY. 
I don’t know what I’m thinking, just BOOM, I told him, I’m seeing someone - with expectation he understand &amp;amp; still want to do this thing (I mean we can casually have sex, with safety for sure....)
But the his reaction was surprised and sound mad because I’m seeing someone. Not so long he said he want to take nap &amp;amp; end the call.

Totally, with his face (he’s very good looking) and A+ skill in bed he got plenty. I ever saw his phone filled with sexy girls too (back in May we went HK and I really open his phone and check!) but he keep denying 😂

"Why do women ask for my cell, but never call back?",2,doldup,https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/doldup/why_do_women_ask_for_my_cell_but_never_call_back/,2,1572355026.0,"I’m a dude. And it’s not often a woman asks for my cell. But I’ve noticed when they do they never call back or text me. It could be poor communication practices, overwhelmed with all the dating app attention, weak networking skills, forgetfulness, etc.

But if the reason is that they aren’t interested, why ask for my cell in the first place? 

It is some weird flex or subtle power move?

Recent Example - met some cool cats in the sauna. Next thing we are all singing together in the sauna. As I am walking upstairs one of the women (23 Yrs old) ask for my cell. I seem familiar to her. She tells me I could do a lot of good work in Colorado. I give her my cell.

Totally platonic. 

I never hit on her at all. If anything, I was hitting on another woman in the sauna we were in. But she left and didn’t ask for my number (despite her telling me she would connect me with some healers she knew. She was 43.) 

Another older woman left her cell at the front desk. I texted, she offered to let me stay in her house for free, and I made her and her daughter dinner. Totally platonic. She was 50 and divorced. 

Then another fellow after the 23 year old woman. He is impressed with my travels (like she is) asks for my cell. He texts back, we meet for coffee, and have a solid conversation about life. I share what I know to suit his situation in life. 

The other times I’ve had this happen I’m always perplexed. I get the culture is that a man initiates and the woman could be shy to text, but why even ask for the cell in the first place?",2

Is it normal to feel extra critical of drivers after getting hit by a car on a crosswalk?,4,doikbb,https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/doikbb/is_it_normal_to_feel_extra_critical_of_drivers/,2,1572339680.0,"Like the title says, I was hit by a car while riding my bike to work last week. After it happened, I cannot cross the street without being overly critical of the people driving. I can’t help it but for whatever reason, I become angry and irritated when someone does not stop to check for a pedestrian when passing through an intersection , ones where daily commuters actively cross. 

Getting hit by a car was jarring, I had right of way to cross the street ,I made eye contact with the driver, and all signs indicated safe. A man was getting off the freeway turning right and completely took my trust away. Pulled up to the light, gave a brief glance to me, the biker, and proceeded to blow through the red light, running me over. He jumped out of his car as soon as he realized what he had done, and he began spitting off excuse after excuse for why this happened. I wasn’t terribly hurt of anything, but my bike is toast. I took his license and insurance info and filed a report with the police. 


Walking to work now, I feel like I have an extra sense. Every car I cross in front of I am just analyzing for any movement. More specifically, the right hand turn lane, No maneuver shows complete lack of care in my eyes than a driver blowing through a right hand turn on a red light. It’s not uncommon for people just to slow down, then hit the throttle once their “line of sight is clear”. nobody ever stops to check unless they have to. 

I feel like I’m too cognizant of everybody and their driving habits, and I feel super shitty crossing the street. Because I know not everyone is a bad driver, but how can I know for sure? Even when I look into a drivers eyes, I still think “ are they genuinely acknowledging that I am currently crossing?”. It’s tough for me. Any way to circumvent this to feel somewhat safer to cross the street?

I think it's perfectly acceptable to recognize your heritage and try and explore that culture. But I think it's weird when people act like being American is somehow lame and basic so they cling on to the genetic shreds left by their ancestors who moved to America hundreds of years ago.

I have a specific friend who sort of acts like he's Swedish even though he has no family there, doesn't speak the language, and has never even been there, yet he often parades around the flag as if he were a Swede.

Is it fundamentally and ethically okay to watch Anime?,0,dooi1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/dooi1b/is_it_fundamentally_and_ethically_okay_to_watch/,26,1572377498.0,"Yo, im posting this question here so i hopefully dont get any biased answers. I just wanna know if I should continue to engage with anime, or if I should stay out of it.

I like ethics, and the theories behind it. So it is from that standpoint I wanna know from the people out there if You believe anime is okay and is not influencing me badly.

I dont want any ”just watch whatever you want, its not hurting anyone”. I wanna know if me watching anime will affect me negativly.

I have watched a few of the popular animes with english dubs and ive enjoyed them, but im debating whether to continue or not.

My main problem are; The ”pedofilia” aka the young children in anime being sexualised and the weird loli culture etcetra. Not saying every anime fan is like that, but I dont wanna engage in them sort of behaviours.

My second problem is the ”Japan culture”. It is imo a very weird obsession many seemingly anime fans has with Japan, and it is not something I wanna become. I dont wanna become obsessed with a culture in another continent since I feel it will affect my social life and social abilities. 

So my main question is, based on my concerns, should I continue to watch anime and go into the more ”non-normie” styled ones or should I stop watching it, since it will make me become someone I dont wanna become?

No personal attacks pls, like ”youre pathetic” since that doesnt add much to the conversation. I wanna hear personal opinions, not just ”do what you want” since I dont really know what I want. 

Thanks in advance",0

How do Europeans differentiate between regular nudity and sexual nudity?,1,dof6ym,https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/dof6ym/how_do_europeans_differentiate_between_regular/,16,1572324856.0,"I have gone over this post a thousand times in my head, trying to be respectful about it. I apologize if I still fail at it, but frankly I'm quite annoyed and I really, truly, sincerely want to understand what I'm missing here.

All the time, I see people on Reddit being super critical of America for being so ""prudish"" about nudity. Thread after thread, comment after comment, constantly people are coming down on the US for allegedly being prudish about nudity. And, I just really don't understand it. I speak and read English, so I literally understand what they're saying, but in terms of comprehending and agreeing with it I do not understand it.

First, they say Americans are prudish about nudity. Then, they turn around and say, ""Everything is so sexual in America! Why is everything so sexual?!"" It happens all the time in the entertainment world. Video games, movies, you name it. I never see Europeans defending scantily clad video game or movie characters, I only see people complaining that they're half-naked, so there's no consistency to it at all. 

Wait. I thought you said Americans were prudish about these things? Apparently though, sex and nudity are different things. So our rating laws are all backwards, apparently? Because of the purtian background? They're not literally having sex, so it's different somehow?

Okay, fair enough. You can't argue with historical facts. I don't fully understand where you draw the line on this though. I've done tons of reading on this and gotten lots of perspectives from different people, and what I've gathered is that, basically, Europeans don't see nudity as being inherently sexual. A woman should be able to be topless just as a man does, according to them. Well, I also see people saying that **everyone** should be able to be nude. Men, women, children, you should be able to see nudity in all forms and not be bothered by it if it's not sexual. Well, I hate to be gross or ask a stupid question, but how do you define child pornography then? Could a pedophile with photos of naked children not just say, ""Not all nudity is sexual. These are just photos of naked people. Checkmate!""

No. Unless I'm mistaken, laws on child pornography are no different in Europe than in the states.

Wait. I thought you said nudity wasn't inherently sexual. So, are photographs more sexual than our eyeballs? To be clear, I'm not advocating for child pornography, I'm just trying to understand what I'm reading on Reddit from people overseas. 

Are men in Europe from a different species than American men, so that they're not attracted to breasts, or naked women? I see no shortage of people enjoying NSFW content on Reddit in the form of nudity, or anywhere else on the internet for that matter. When is it logical to be attracted to naked people, and when is it not? Is it weird that I'm turned on around naked people? Is that what you're telling me?

None of this adds up to me. All I see is a lot of double standards and judgemental attitude towards Americans. If nudity is such a non-issue, if you're so nonchalant about it, why do people even wear clothes at all? Why not just go nude all the time, except for your shoes to protect your feet? I thought we evolved as a species, so now we wear clothes instead of loincloths, but now you're telling me Americans are backwards for insisting on wearing clothes? But we're also too sexualized for our nudity that we've tried to apply a fair rating system too?

My brain hurts. I'm not dense, I can see the cultural significance in some cases. For example, I understand that in Japan, bathing is often something that families do together. I'm guessing that many people in the West are probably still uncomfortable doing that. But still, that's within a family, there's a different dynamic there. Even I used to shower and bathe with my brother as kids for several years until we both got older. But in the West, culturally? The judgemental attitude about Americans just makes no sense to me. I'm sick and tired of being made to feel bad because I like boobs, for crying out loud.",1

To do that i need the internet and privacy otherwise it is literally constant distractions but my parents just constantly enter distracting where i am when i am studying. It really distracts me. I spite her at times when studying when she says ""I hope your not on games"".

It grew so that my parents do not trust me to be alone to study. If I do not block the door to my room they burst in if not just shout at me to unlock the door as they believe i can only go on to games/youtube or be the cause for there to be a computer virus on the computer. They also want to check out my search history after i use the laptop alone to study which i hate them snooping around. My parents feel that if they can't see my search history then the laptop has to go, leaving me with the computer which in an area with no privacy and constantly freezes resulting in me procrastinating more with the tv as i feel i need the laptop, the internet to study.

On top of this my mum is toxic too at times after if i ever say i need the laptop to study the conversation now results in ""I hope you fail your exams"", ""Idiot"". Also belittling too asking me to ""Apologise"" or says ""How dare you speak to me like that"". Losing temper too is a result with her starting to try to pinch me, throw her arms around and scratch me ,poking and prodding and yelling at me.

Would shooting trash up into the upper(?) atmosphere where it could burn up affect the composition of the atmosphere itself?,3,do6skt,https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/do6skt/would_shooting_trash_up_into_the_upper_atmosphere/,4,1572286065.0,"I just watched a video about the International Space Station, and the astronaut mentioned that during reentry to earth’s atmosphere the Soyuz can release trash so it burns up. Could the same be done the opposite way? For example, sending up a vehicle of some sort with landfill trash and having it burn up in the atmosphere somehow. I’m not a physicist obviously haha so I’m just curious to know what happens to the gases produced. It would be an expensive solution for sure but would it have any effect on the gases of the atmosphere? (Or cause any other negative effects other than financial)",3

How do Men blackout at parties/social gatherings without fear,0,doaal0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/doaal0/how_do_men_blackout_at_partiessocial_gatherings/,7,1572304931.0," At first, it started off with me being a creep towards girls and touching them inappropriately without their permission(I have no recollection of this complete blackout). What led to me vowing to never blackout again one day I acted like such a creep I went up to the same group of 4 girls over and over trying to dance and when they would reject me I would go back and when my friends tried holding me back from going to the girls I would push them to the side(again no recollection at all of any of this), I then knocked over 20 people on the dance floor because of how fucked up I was. I then almost got into a fight with a large group of black men(which my friends again got me out of;I am Indian btw not a FOB). I kept trying to tap one of the black men on the shoulder to tell him everything was fine which got him increasingly agitated. Apparently my friend was horrified that I would say the N-word(I say it amongst ourselves but I wouldn't be stupid enough to say it to a large group of black men sober). I never did the situation was handled and I was kicked out of the club for simply being passed out on a Sofa. So I waited passed out outside the club for my friends who came out 30 minutes later. The kicker for the end of a horrible night I HAD NO RECOLLECTION OF; I LOST MY FUCKIN PHONE TOO. In addition, I have a friend in a Fraternity who blacked out one night and got alleged by a girl that he was sexually harassing her. This lead to him being put on social probation from the frat for a quarter and he believes he has been ostracized and will be dropping the frat soon. This has shaped me to never blackout in my life again. A lot of women don't like to because they don't want to be taken advantage of by men. Men also shouldn't want to because they are put in compromising situations with women and dangerous situations in general that they have no control over.",0
