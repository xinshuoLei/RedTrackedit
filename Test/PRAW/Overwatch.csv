Blizzard please do not treat any heroes in the future like you have with Sombra,44224,585qsj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/585qsj/blizzard_please_do_not_treat_any_heroes_in_the/,3191,1476847179.0,"**Note:** To those coming from /r/all user /u/Panromir gave this quick summary if you're unfamiliar with the situation
>To everyone coming from /r/all (where this is #1 right now):

>Blizzard have started a so called ARG (Alternate Reality Game) teasing a new hero for their game Overwatch. In that ARG the hero ""hacked"" the blizzard forums leaving clues that the players could decode. Overall that was a fun experience.

>Now they left those who followed the event a website (amomentincrime.com) with a very slow going countdown that ended today (after several weeks). At the end of the countdown we got: Nothing. People here are fed up.


Let me start by saying some of the ARG stuff is cool. Like the website or small hints in game. However all this Sombra ""hype"" has reached a point where I'm completely sick and tired of hearing about her. Sure, I'm excited for a new hero. But at this point Sombra has become more of a meme than an actual character. And nothing they introduce with her will be able to live up to the, frankly frustrating, amount of hype she's been given. It seems like every time we're FINALLY going to see a release, it turns out to be yet another teaser.

I guess the short answer is I'm sick of hearing about her. And if this is how every hero is going to be treated from now on, I worry every character will be released to disappointment rather than excitement. 

EDIT: Only 20 minutes in and this has already hit number 36 on /r/all. I tweeted this link to the Overwatch twitter, hopefully they'll take this as notice that this has been a horribly handled hero release and maybe we'll get hero reveals more like Ana in the future.

EDIT 2: Annnd number 1 on the front page of /r/all. I think that's all the proof Blizzard needs.

Also a kind stranger gave gold and I felt their message was just too good to keep for myself:

> ""I really really hope someone at Blizzard reads your post. You've said what most of the community is thinking, and hopefully Blizzard won't do this again. With the way Blizzard is treating her, Sombra better be able to shoot lasers out of her ass and turn aluminum into gold.""


**Final Edit**: So I've gotten an inbox full (about 45+ PMs) of people asking me why this post is being massively downvoted. At one point it was up to 11k and now it's half that. My best guess is that once it hit the front page it got hit with bots or something to that effect. It really does not bother me that this post is losing fake internet points. I think the point has been made and hopefully Blizzard heard it! Please don't send me any more messages about the downvotes, thanks!",2016-10-19 11:19:39

Blizzard we have 24 heroes now....,37778,5yfx06,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/5yfx06/blizzard_we_have_24_heroes_now/,1983,1489104650.0,"12v12 deathmatch. Large scale arena. I'm thinking a nice circular map with a lot of open space in the center for some intrigue and a more cluttered/covered outer ring. 
  
Edit: **Wow gilded *five* times. Thanks everybody I'm so glad that I was able to provide a discussion we all feel passionate about. I love this community. We all love this game and we all want it succeed so we can keep on playing!! If you are reading this edit, keep talking about this game! Keep discussing how things can improve and what changes you like or would like because this game is worth it (Side note I wasn't trying to spark a revolution here just inspire more discussion). We are a component to this game's life. The developers have made that very clear. Thanks again!**  
I think this discussion proves that there is definite interest in larger scale matches and/or larger scale elimination matches. CTF was a success (even if it isn't a game mode added to the rotation of Quickplay or Competitive). Its something that we can enjoy in the game because the community responded so positively to it. Adding even a 6v6 deathmatch or maybe, in the future, an 8v8/10v10/12v12 match option seems to be what people want or at least what a large majority want.
As a lot of posters have said, some PCs probably would not be able to handle something so large scale. However, this is a niche mode that has a lot backing by the community and I think we would all like to see Blizzard give it a try.  
Personally, I'd love to see a mode where each and every hero comes to play in one match. ",2017-03-10 08:10:50

####Bug 1.

Unstopped Ghost Punch - it is when DF goes through the target all the way till the RP stops by itself, the full distance is traveled.

Examples:

* 1.1 https://gfycat.com/FirmSomberItaliangreyhound
* 1.2 https://gfycat.com/SmoothRealCassowary

* 1.6 https://clips.twitch.tv/DeafExuberantManateeANELE
* 1.7 https://clips.twitch.tv/BluePlainRingBrainSlug - this is a combination of 3 bugs in one punch actually. First, doomfist bounces off the right wall, second, he ghosts through reinhardt(unstopped), third, he doesn't break the railing before falling into the water.
* 1.8 https://gfycat.com/FlawedComplexJabiru?speed=0.5

* 1.10 https://clips.twitch.tv/ResoluteCreativePeppermintPartyTime
* 1.11 https://clips.twitch.tv/BoldFastGrasshopperMikeHogu

&nbsp;


####Bug 2.

Stopped Ghost Punch - it is when DF goes through the target and the animation of punching is played as if DF punched the target, but DF is stopped shortly after w/o traveling the full punch distance, and nobody was actually punched.

Examples:

* 2.1 https://gfycat.com/RecentSparklingEthiopianwolf
* 2.2 https://gfycat.com/TightExemplaryAlbacoretuna
* 2.3 https://youtu.be/YR3vFJorg1Y?t=211 - 3 examples of a stopped ghost punch
* 2.4 https://clips.twitch.tv/ClumsyStrongDonkeyBloodTrail



&nbsp;


####Bug 3.

Wall slides - it is when you punch the target into a wall but it doesn't take impact damage and slides off of it instead.

Examples:

* 3.1 https://giant.gfycat.com/VigorousLightheartedBeauceron.webm
* 3.2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quXP1_gDNV8
* 3.3 https://streamable.com/7onk6 - Slide off of thin air

* 3.25 https://gfycat.com/InsecureWindyIchthyostega

&nbsp;


####Bug 4.

The Bouncy Bug - Introduced with the Mercy/Dva rework patch. Doomfist bounces off the walls and misses his target which he aimed for, usually resulting in death.

Examples:

* 4.1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWy_YdBml5Q&t= - Extensive testing and showcasing.
* 4.2 https://youtu.be/hBHIYM0pHpA?t=459 - bounced by the left wall
* 4.3 https://gfycat.com/EnviousClosedAsiansmallclawedotter - In-game
* 4.4 https://gfycat.com/ImpossibleThatAdouri - In-game
* 4.5 https://gfycat.com/DapperInformalAtlanticbluetang - DF bounced off the wall on the right
* 4.6 https://gfycat.com/GaseousLivelyCollardlizard - DF bounced off the wall on the right
* 4.7 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhDz3iJP1zc - **proof it wasn't like this before.**

* 4.12 https://gfycat.com/ImpartialInfamousCrow - bounced vertically from the table
* 4.13 https://clips.twitch.tv/NurturingDarlingYakinikuStinkyCheese


&nbsp;



####Bug 5.

Rocket Punch Stun Ignore - some characters like zarya and reaper can sometimes activate their shift midway through the punch knockback.

Examples:

* 5.1 https://clips.twitch.tv/SarcasticSmilingFloofTheRinger - Reaper. Activates the shift miliseconds after being punched, when the stun should be still active. Even if we assume he did it after the stun, which doesn't ware off that fast, but lets assume, the wall splat animation was played. If he was in shift, why did the splat animation got played? if he wasn't in shift when it played, why didn't he take any damage? no matter how you look at it, makes no sense.
* 5.2 https://clips.twitch.tv/VibrantSneakyClipzItsBoshyTime - Zarya
* 5.3 https://gfycat.com/ShamelessKindlyFanworms - going through it frame by frame, moira gets hit by RP, slams into a wall and plays the splat animation, but shifts afterwards and takes no damage from the wall splat.
* 5.4 https://clips.twitch.tv/StupidHedonisticSwallowOptimizePrime - genji uses dash after his supposed death


&nbsp;


####Bug 6.

Delayed Rocket Punch - Doomfist just stops midair for some duration of the rocket jump instead of going forward, or the full duration of it.

Examples:

* 6.1 https://gfycat.com/HarmlessCheapKilldeer
* 6.2 https://gfycat.com/BiodegradableDopeyBluet
* 6.3 https://gfycat.com/WetGoldenBlackpanther
* 6.4 https://gfycat.com/NeglectedCloseChuckwalla
* 6.5 https://clips.twitch.tv/JollyNastyMonkeyVoteYea
* 6.6 https://clips.twitch.tv/AbstemiousDarkClamSoBayed
* 6.7 https://clips.twitch.tv/SleepyAgileEchidnaSeemsGood
* 6.8 https://clips.twitch.tv/BlightedGlutenFreeCodJonCarnage
* 6.9 https://youtu.be/xFx28LN8ofw

&nbsp;


####Bug 7.

Rocket punch does not break destructable objects.

Examples: 

* 7.1 https://gfycat.com/TemptingTerrificAfricanporcupine - in actual match. Slow it down at the impact moment if it isn't obvious.
* 7.2 https://gfycat.com/ImpureFeminineJenny


&nbsp;


####Bug 8.

Mei's Wall <-> RP Interaction - often rocket punch won't punch the person in front of the wall, but will hit the wall behind the person and stop.

Examples:

* 8.1 https://youtu.be/YR3vFJorg1Y?t=273
* 8.2 https://giant.gfycat.com/EveryWindingGartersnake.webm
* 8.3 https://clips.twitch.tv/ElatedFuriousAnteaterDoubleRainbow

&nbsp;


####Bug 9.

Genji's Dash <-> RP Interaction - Genji's dash ignores the stun and the knockback effect, and continues to travel until it stops by itself.

Example:

* 9.1 https://streamable.com/dlyoh - dash ignores the stun and the knockback continuing along its path
* 9.2 https://streamable.com/f5jct - genji pins himself into a wall after ignoring the punch stun and knockback, because his dash ended near a wall
* 9.3 https://gfycat.com/BlackandwhiteIllinformedBats - same as 9.2
* 9.4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6djoZxoF2s - similar to 9.1 but from genji's pov
* 9.5 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdwf7bqZVFM - similar to 9.2 but from genji's pov


&nbsp;


####Bug 10.

Reinahrdt Charge <-> RP Ineraction = often Doomfist gets stunned by punching a charging reinhardt from an angle that shouldn't be considered as a pin angle for reinhard, like punching rein from a side/back.

Examples:

* 10.1 https://gfycat.com/CorruptAccurateImago?speed=0.125 - i don't even know if this is a case of ghost punch or a bug with interaction with the charge. Somehow doomfist gets pinned while hitting(didn't actually hit anything btw) rein from the back. 
* 10.2 https://gfycat.com/OptimisticIdioticBear - Doomfist gets stunned by punching a charging rein more than 90 degrees from his face



&nbsp;



-----------------------------------------------
##Seismic Slam Bugs

####Bug 11.

Seismic Slam no damage registration - when the target is in your seismic slam area of damage, it doesn't take any damage as if it didn't get hit at all.

Examples:

* 11.1 https://gfycat.com/CavernousAnxiousGossamerwingedbutterfly
* 11.2 https://gfycat.com/ImperfectFondAquaticleech
* 11.3 https://clips.twitch.tv/MagnificentPuzzledBulgogiBlargNaut

* 11.8 https://clips.twitch.tv/DignifiedSpikyVelociraptorWOOP
* 11.9 https://clips.twitch.tv/ZanyHungryOxBatChest


&nbsp;



####Bug 12.

Seismic Slam Cancellation - Slam sometimes is randomly canceled completely and puts it on cooldown, w/o triggering the wave at all.

Examples:

* 12.1 https://streamable.com/2f28b
* 12.2 https://clips.twitch.tv/TawdrySullenSwallowBrokeBack
* 12.3 https://clips.twitch.tv/ArborealCautiousScallionCharlieBitMe
* 12.4 https://youtu.be/-XMQDBFTz_E?t=15
* 12.5 https://clips.twitch.tv/SingleZealousGrassKAPOW

&nbsp;


####Bug 13.

Instant Seismic Slam - in certain circumstances, the skill activates instantly, no honing/small jump, just isntantly, and usually for 11 damage.

Examples:

* 13.1 https://gfycat.com/IncompatibleOldFairybluebird
* 13.2 https://gfycat.com/RealisticAgreeableGreyhounddog
* 13.3 https://gfycat.com/ReliableWarpedKakapo - instant slam on the head
* 13.4 https://clips.twitch.tv/FunRepleteStarGivePLZ

* 13.6 https://clips.twitch.tv/SpineySuaveIcecreamDeIlluminati
* 13.7 https://clips.twitch.tv/HonestRenownedGalagoKeepo
* 13.8 https://clips.twitch.tv/CarefulSavoryAnacondaSuperVinlin


&nbsp;


####Bug 14.

Grounded Slam Output With Aerial Slam Indicator - often when the indicator for a honing slam appears, Doomfist does a grounded slam instead.

Examples:

* 14.1 https://gfycat.com/SolidEdibleAustralianfreshwatercrocodile


&nbsp;


####Bug 15.

Grounded Slam Output From High Altitude - happens if there is a character below doomfist, despite both being at high altitude above the ground.

Examples:

* 15.1 https://clips.twitch.tv/CalmAmazonianTriangleFeelsBadMan - Slam bugs and gives a grounded version because dva is below doomfist.


&nbsp;

####Bug 19.

Slam Crosshair ""Teleportation"" - Seismic Slam Crosshair ""teleports"" back if moved during the impact

Examples:

* 19.1 https://gfycat.com/ViciousPositiveBullmastiff - Seismic Slam Crosshair ""teleports"" back if moved during the impact
* 19.2 https://youtu.be/oG9ksWV0ooY - another example of Slam Crosshair Bug

-----------------------------------------------
##Uppercut Bugs

####Bug 16.

No Launch Uppercut - Sometimes the uppercut doesn't launch the enemy up, or in the direction you uppercut.

Examples:

* 16.2 https://clips.twitch.tv/LovelyOilyHorseKappaClaus


&nbsp;


####Bug 17.

Grounded Uppercut - You uppercut but don't go up. I've seen it one time.

Examples:

* 17.1 https://clips.twitch.tv/RockyJoyousTomatoSquadGoals - i don't even know how to explain it. No packet loss, no jittering, low ping. What the hell happened?
* 17.2 https://youtu.be/-XMQDBFTz_E?t=5

&nbsp;

##Meteor Strike Bugs.

####Bug 18.

Incorrect Ult Landing - Ult lands on an unperchable ledge despite being centered below.

##Compilations

This section containt videos that compiled bugs from different categories.

* 19.A.1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aEvi9A8gB0
* 19.A.2 https://youtu.be/YR3vFJorg1Y?t=44
* 19.A.3 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRMUbUD7VKY
* 19.A.4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wQC456kDvI



&nbsp;


-----------------------------------------------
##Other Bugs 

I don't even know in which category to put due to their rarity/unclarity/similarity with other bugs.

* 20.A.1 https://clips.twitch.tv/YummyPlausibleMacaroniRiPepperonis - Slam got stuck on the door somehow. Usually these kind of slams get cancelled completely, which is also a bug, but this one didn't, which isn't normal too. Doomfist shouldn't get stuck on objects.
* 20.A.2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2MZm3ox3Cs - after being uppercuted, genji can dash from midair before reaching ground, which will lock his movement until he touches ground. Not sure if bug or feature, but i'll list it just in case.
* 20.A.3 https://clips.twitch.tv/RealAgreeableFiddleheadsDAESuppy - Junkrat is unaffected by the RP while ulting. Not sure if bug or feature, but intuition tells me that junkrat should get knocked back by the punch, so i'll list it just in case.
* 20.A.4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hj2EO1k_rs - i don't know. Looks like Mercy just ignored the RP stun and knockback.
* 20.A.5 https://youtu.be/lI0nFB1FQhE - looks like a more crazy version of bug 20.A.1. Seems like slam was targeted in the back area inside the ship, but it went under and behind the ship, close to the targeted position but not on the correct side of the wall. 
* 20.A.6 https://imgur.com/a/7pkrB - looks like a case of kings row car, being hit through some object.
* 20.A.7 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Hu-LtGB4 - using Seismic slam (E) through a teleporter sometimes causes Doomfist to come gliding out of the teleporter at the other side.
* 20.A.8 https://gfycat.com/BlankTalkativeHalibut - a very questionable hit
* 20.A.9 https://youtu.be/4Y5epzAT8gk - something really weird.
* 20.A.10 https://youtu.be/EowluaHRxIY - McCree roll + RP interaction bug


&nbsp;


-----------------------------------------------
##Lowering Seismic Slam Frustration Factor

There is also one more thing i would like to address, it is not a bug, but it is a massive source of frustration. This suggestion is a tl;dr version of this thread(https://redd.it/7dru1l), where i go with a little bit more explanation.


&nbsp;


I'm talking about the situation where Slam lands directly into an enemy and completely whiffs, despite being right on top of him. I suggest making a small area around doomfist, in the point of landing, to also be considered the slam area.

Example:

* 21.A.1  https://clips.twitch.tv/DelightfulArtisticGrouseTwitchRPG

Here is an imagine of what i mean: https://i.imgur.com/2OanzWw.png

-----------------------------------------------
##Removing Inconsistency From the Shotgun

Doomfist's shotgun has a completely RNG spread, and it makes it inconsistent for no reason. The RNG is so big that it makes the shotgun have high variance in results.

&nbsp;



See this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J18bsHeoRc4

&nbsp;



RNG introduces a variance in the TTK, from 2 shots to kill to 4, which is double the shots. This is bad and leads to inconsistent results. Nobody plays doomfist atm because his bugs make him inconsistent and frustrating to play, having a built in inconsistent tool is just beyond me. There is no good reason to have this RNG, especially in a eSports oriented game. 

&nbsp;



The RNG spread should be removed and made into predetermined spread, that is always the same, with every shot.



&nbsp;


-----------------------------------------------
I will be adding more examples with time, if you have more bugs not posted here or more examples, please post and i will add it.

He either plays mei and door blocks or picks mercy and dies repeatedly. I followed the account and found a community which he's a part of which does just throws. I also watched the stream, on which he selects ""Prefer this player"" for the people who react to him by t-bagging or talking shit against him on the voice chat.

**1. ""It's not fair that the skin won't belong only to me and a small percent to the community.""**

This is the biggest argument i've seen and the most entitled and pathetic one. If you bought overwatch after the summer games, would you still hold this idea? Nope. You get a year of exclusivity and that's way more than enough.

**2.""I spent money trying to get this skin and blizzard is spitting in my face.""**

Nobody forced you to pay. They're cosmetics. It's not fair to keep them locked out to everyone else because you shelled out some money. Besides, if they bring back the skins they'd get lots of money. They're a company. 

**3."" The skins should retain their rarity"".**

They did, for an entire year. If blizzard allowed no way to  get them again it would be a slap in the face to most of the community.

TL;DR stop being entitled and go play some lucioball.

A solution to Sombra's DPS issues:,26798,5mv60p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/5mv60p/a_solution_to_sombras_dps_issues/,1643,1483959273.0,"^^^^^^^` A lot of people have complained about Sombra's DPS. Some say that she isn't supposed to win straight-up fights, that you have to use stealth and hack to gain the upper hand. That's true, but no matter how good your positioning is, she still struggles to secure kills (unless you have godlike tracking).

^^^^^^^^`
Both sides have a point: Sombra is an offense hero, and needs decent DPS. At the same time, raising her DPS overall would encourage people to play her as a skirmisher--a knockoff tracer--instead of the stealth flanker she was designed to be.

^^^^^^^^`
I think the solution is a compromise between the two views: **increase Sombra's damage to hacked targets.**

^^^^^^^^`
In the PTR, Sombra's hack cast time has been reduced to .8s, making it more reliable. This is a good start; it encourages players to flank instead of going in guns blazing. But it needs more:

^^^^^^^^`
When you hack, you've expended the element of surprise hacking instead of doing damage. Sure, they don't have access to their abilities now. But Sombra doesn't have any combat abilities *either.* **All you've done by ""outplaying"" them and securing the hack is to even the playing field: Their left click vs. your left click.**

^^^^^^^^`
So, to be a decent Attack hero, Sombra's left click needs to be able to win fights--if she has earned it. She earns the upper hand by landing the hack, just as Roadhog earns the upper hand by landing the hook.

^^^^^^^^`
If Sombra plays correctly, flanking and hacking as intended, she is rewarded with extra damage to secure kills without changing her playstyle to that of Tracer. Note that this damage increase is only for Sombra; it is not a global debuff like Discord.

^^^^^^^^`

"Blizzard, we need to talk. Everyone is calling your new hero ""Hammond""... The name ""Wrecking Ball"" is uninspired... Perhaps consider a rename before release?",24330,8vgwy7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/8vgwy7/blizzard_we_need_to_talk_everyone_is_calling_your/,2666,1530547088.0,"The hero name ""Wrecking Ball"" feels really off and based on all the ""Hammond"" posts online, the community is feeling it (and not just because of the prior Hammond expectation).

Put simply: Wrecking Ball is generic and uninspired; like a WIP name with no real charisma or individuality. It would be like naming Bastion ""Tank"", D.Va ""Mech"" or Zenyatta ""Robot"".

Your hero names have always been personal and full of character. This is part of your ethos as a game development company. The characters and game world is just as important as the game itself.

So, please, do Hammy justice. Consider renaming Wrecking Ball to Hammond prior to official release. 

*If you want to keep consistent with mech/pilot, a la D.Va/Hana Song, either: a) do some lore rejigging to justify why Hammond the hamster has unified with his mech; maybe as Hammond never leaves the mech - unlike D.Va... or b) Leave ""Hammond"" as the hamster name and give his mech an entirely new personal name that isn't <insert generic words here>*

TL;DR - ""Wrecking Ball"" is a weird name that doesn't really fit with the rest of Overwatch lore. A rename to ""Hammond"" before hero release isn't too late!",2018-07-02 23:58:08

so one last time my deepest gratitude toward all of you wonderful peeps who helped  bringing this tho blizz's attention, thanks to you i'll remain able to enjoy overwatch, thank you


i'll be up front about this, this is a post relating to disability, accessibility so it will most likely apply to no one but me but i'd still like to post this

as you can guess i'm a disabled guy, normally i'm not really able to play any shooter, (or at least not in anyway decent) because i'm incapable of using wasd on a keyboard consistently or aim with a controller. but! overwatch is weird in that it allows me to use both a controller, (which replaces a keybords wasd) and a mouse (which replaces a controllers crappy aiming )in tandem because it allows for seemsless switching between input modes. that means what basically happens is the games is constantly switching between controller and keyboard so fast it registers both.

so using this weird amalgam of controll methods i have been been actually able to enjoy overwatch, usually playing mercy beaming and boosting with the mouse

however, the latest update has made it so that the game stops registering right click mouse input as soon as the controller activates.... so basically the boost beam is unusable now (unless standing still being easy pickin's ) 

i know this is extremely specific and nitpicky but i'm just afraid that if this was just an oversight  they'll eventually patch it out completely and that would mean the end of my overwatch fun

TLDR i'm disabled, thus use a really weird controll scheme that may have been an oversight and the latest patch made mercy not really playable with that scheme, and i'm kinda afraid they'll eventually patch it out completely
 
EDIT: Ok i didn't expect this kind of reaction, thanks y'all, 
i've been messing about with the options like toggle beam, played a few matches it's clunky and makes me even more inacurate ,(before this update the beam had the tendency to stick to a target sometimes and not let go, maybe this was a side effect from my weird setup) but **at least i'm able to buff again, and hey i'll take what i can get :D ** Aside from that i've been checking out other heroes with a similar button held ability (rein walking with shield, zarya's beam and symmetra's primary fire, ) and none of them have this so it's a weird mercy only thing (it seems) anyway thanks to you all and although i realise it's a bit nitpicky seeing as sticky beam (kinda solves it, i still hope its something that can be fixed, and that they don't patch this out intirely

again thanks for the support everyone",2017-03-24 07:19:30

There are so many times when my team is losing and I *know* I could probably save it by switching from Lucio or Zen. You don’t have to tell us. We know.

I apologize, but at this point you couldn’t pay me to play Mercy anymore, I’m sick to death of it. If you really want a Mercy to win you’re free to switch to her. You don’t want to, but neither do I. The fact that I chose a healer doesn’t make “being Mercy” my responsibility.

Well, As you must have seen by now the points have been addressed and some have been fixed. However we all know the posts that said **FIX DOOMFIST** coming up everyday, but it was addressed properly when a user put time and effort into their post.  
  
**TL;DR**: If you are going to make a post on how a character needs balancing or needs bug fixes... structure it properly and provide examples of the problems, do not simply say **OMG FIX PLS**, because if you do structure your post correctly you have a **much** higher chance of your post having an impact.

With just 5 hours to go, I was grinding my way back to Diamond Rank before season 11 ends. Middle of the game, everyone begins disconnecting. I soon realise Blizzard have pushed out a compulsory update for D.va cosmetics in the middle of my competitive game.

We now all lose 50 SR for leaving the game, despite Blizzard pushing this loss onto us themselves.

This is not fair and completely nonsensical. Wait until the competitive season ends before you push out an update and crash the servers by advertising it all over Twitter.

Is this a rant post? Definitely. Do I want Blizzard to learn from this as it is utterly hypocritical and unfair? Yes.

**Edit:**   


**This post made the front page, so there's a good chance Blizzard will see this.

We have tons of creative people in this community, so we could also do contributor cards for best Overwatch related OC like fan art, cosplay, song, or video.

We could also give out some prizes. I know it's kind of late, but it would be really cool even if its just a gift card to the battle.net store for some loot boxes. 

If it catches on, we could have much nicer prizes next year!

**Edit:**

#I have created the [[Overwatch Play of the Year Discord.]](https://discord.gg/9KpdVsT)

 Join up if you'd like to be involved in planning this event out! I sure as hell don't know what I'm doing!

Some points/suggestions from people in the comments:
-------
* Have categories for highlights so that a funny clip doesn't beat out something really unique

* Have a weekly or monthly contest so that the end of the year event next year has a smaller, but still quality pool of nominees.

* Some people are very mad that I suggested this because there are too many PotG's to choose from, and/or they don't trust the community to vote. (I don't know what you want from me. I have gold elims.)

* I agree that there a ton to choose from, so, at least for this year, maybe we should limit nominations in certain ways? Maybe people who at least have reddit accounts? Also, that they can verify their account in the nomination thread. Also, we should have a nomination thread.

* Mod's will probably have to get involved.

* a good place to start looking for [**Play of the Year might be in the /top/ tab**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/top/)  ",2016-12-04 06:24:18

He asked us to please not kick him because he was really trying to do better.

So we tried to help, advise him to move a bit more, pick certain characters. We ended up staying in a five/six stack and I’m just really grateful to that bunch of people. I think we made that guy’s day. We won half of the 12 games we played together! One of our healers was especially awesome with the directing.

"Blizzard, please, fix the colorblind mode",20545,5uw5cs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/5uw5cs/blizzard_please_fix_the_colorblind_mode/,976,1487500165.0,"**EDIT: I posted on BNET too because Blizzard is more likely to see it there I guess. https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20753358429#post-1**


Hello, I'm Kolorblind. I'm a colorblind Bastion player and currently ranked #1 in competitive, and was the first Bastion only account to reach top 500 with Solo Q.

I'm here to beg for a fix for the colorblind mode in this game, it's awful.

I have protonopia, which means I can't see red hardly at all- it looks gray for me.
Take a second to imagine how hard this game would be if the enemies didn't have outlines at all, just dark characters against a dark background.

It'd kind of suck wouldn't it? That's how it is for me, and it fucking sucks.

""But Kolor, this game already has colorblind support! It's in the video options, Blizzard thought of everything!""
Yes, I know, but those options fucking suck.
Why do they suck? Because they're filters, not colorblind modes.

----------------------

Here's what a good colorblind mode would do, it would change the colors of enemies outlines, UI effects, and in game effects such as Mei's ice wall, Winston's bubble, and so on.

That would be radical, and would let me play the game correctly without walking past a widow just standing against a wall because I couldn't see her.

What does the colorblind mode in this game do? It's a filter, so it changes every single color on your screen do a different color- for example, one of the colorblind modes it called the Tritanopia mode, in theory, it makes the bad guys purple, and makes the good guys a vivid green; perfect, right?

If only; because it doesn't just change the enemies to purple, it changes all red in the ENTIRE GAME to purple- meaning outlines, UI, and the entire fucking map. Everything. It also changes all blue to green, so the game looks like a totally radical acid trip.

Example: http://i.imgur.com/chG6kb1.jpg (credit to /u/minisusoend)

--------------------

Using this mode is very disorianting and chatotic, I've used it for a few months just because using the normal mode is legit impossible for me because I can't see red. I'm forced to play like this, and I hate it.
I want to see the game like it should be, I want to see the green grass and blue skies and radical skins without it being fucked up by all this purple and green. 

Not to mention it means I still have trouble because yeah, the bad guys are purple, but so is everything else in the map- so it's still hard as fuck to see them.


Blizzard, you're OW development team is fucking amazing at fixing bugs, patching up shit, and getting updates out all the time, so why have you ignored the colorblind support since launch?

I'm begging you, please at least tell us why you refuse to fix it.

~~And since this post will almost definitely be buried,~~ I guess I'm just here to ask if anyone is bored enough to draw a cute mock-up - and what other halloween ideas you guys have :)

**Edit 2:** Here are a few of the arts people made. Linking to the comments as not all of them are signed.

Drop me a line if I missed yours.

Also u/ASmileOnTop suggested a separate sub for talking OW skins and created r/hallowatch so drop by any time you want to geek out about OW ideas.


**Edit:** okay so I guess the post didn't get buried. A lot of people are commenting on Copyrights - Cinderella is a public domain character however Disney's design isn't. Bibbity Bobbity Boom wouldn't be allowed, but the rest should be fine. 

I also really don't expect this to be in for this year, Halloween skins are likely already planned/mostly developed. I'm glad so many people like the idea though! Will be updating again with some art shortly.",2017-08-31 05:19:18
