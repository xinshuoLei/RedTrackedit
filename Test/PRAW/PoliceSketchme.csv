"[Request] 18M Caucasian: Saw this sub on AskReddit, decided to give it a shot",12017,df8i0c,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliceSketchme/comments/df8i0c/request_18m_caucasian_saw_this_sub_on_askreddit/,1246,1570606857.0,"**EDIT** I have posted reference pictures at the end of this post. If you're an artist interested in sketching faces, I suggest you check out some of the new posts on r/PoliceSketchme.

This seems like a really cool sub idea-- I hope it gets revived and, to help, I'm putting my own drawing request out there! If I see other new posts, I'll try to contribute my own drawings as well.

Anyways, on to the post:

**Gender:** Male

**Height/build:** 6'2"", very skinny.

**Head shape/jaw:** Head is medium-thin, taller than it is wide-- the sides of my jaw are decently angular.

**Eyes:** My eye shape is pretty standard, maybe slightly on the squinty side-- and my upper eyelid covers much more of my eye than my lower eyelid. My eyes have a little bit of a ""relaxed"" look. I also have medium-long, dark eyelashes.

**Eye color:** My driver's liscense says hazel, but they're more hazel on the inside and green on the outside.

**Eyebrows:** Very dark brown. Also very full (to the point that I would easily develop a unibrow if I were to stop shaving) and pretty angular.

**Chin:** On the less ""bold"" side. Maybe slightly recessed, although that is not especially visible from the front. Looking from the front, it follows the angular shape of the rest of the jaw, but it is not pointy.

**Mouth:** Pretty standard-- the corners roughly match up with my pupils-- my lower lip is slightly taller than my upper lip. The shape defaults to neither a smile nor a frown.

**Nose:** Standard as far as width, but points slightly farther out from my face. It's also angled up *very* slightly.

**Ears:** Neither pointy nor large. Pretty average in terms of shape.

**Hair color:** Dark brown.

**Hair style:** Medium length and slightly wavy (in terms of male haircuts). The style is not unusual: the hair on the top of my head is combed up/back and to the right, like a wave, and the hair on the left side of my head is combed downwards and away from my face. My hair is also on the denser/coarser side.

**Facial hair:** Very faint beard on end of chin.

**Skin tone:** White

**Piercings:** None

**Tattoos:** None

**Miscellaneous:** Very slight acne, and people often say that I look a bit nerdy. I'm also usually mistaken as being in my very late teens or very early 20s.

~~EDIT TO ADD: I'm getting a lot of people commenting the !remindme command or asking when I'm going to be releasing the reference pics-- since there are still lots of people submitting responses, I am going to be holding off on releasing any reference pictures until this post reaches 1 day old, which will be 8:00 PM, Eastern Standard Time. Once that happens, I'll edit this post with a link to the reference pictures.~~

~~I've definitely seen plenty of really good guesses so far, so keep up the good work!~~









**EDIT:** Wow, so that was pretty crazy.

I've for the most part stopped receiving image submissions, and people are getting antsy, so I'm giving to go ahead and release the reference pictures. [Here I am.](https://imgur.com/gallery/dy1Lisg) (I think you guys drew me as way more attractive than I actually am, lol)

But also, I just want to send a huge thank you to everyone who participated! In total, I counted 44 submissions(!) which I've tried to gather all together in [this Imgur post](http://imgur.com/gallery/duYXesr). It was crazy seeing all the insanely talented artists who contributed to this thread, and it was especially mind blowing to see how a description of my face can be rendered in so many art styles!

I'll let you guys be the real judges of who had the most accurate police sketch here, but I want to include [a list of the top 5 faces I felt most closely resembled mine](http://imgur.com/gallery/hBvg0ua). Huge kudos to u/hapaxlegomenonon, u/spucc, u/rainey11, u/Madam_Bomb, and u/TisITheGreatNoodle for their accuracy!

If you did take part in this thread, I strongly encourage you to continue to participate in r/PoliceSketchme! Pretty much overnight, we went from a dead community of less than 1700 members to a community of over 22k and growing-- for reference, [that little line on the right side of this chart shows how much we've grown in the past 24 hours](https://imgur.com/gallery/8FDhynT). Hopefully we can continue to follow this line of intense growth and keep this sub in a thriving state!

I've never had so many people this excited to see my face, but, of course, this has been a really fun and wild experience all around. Again, I can't thank all of you talented people enough for joining me, and I hope to continue to see you around in r/PoliceSketchme!",2019-10-09 15:40:57

Always wanted to see what a police sketch of me would look like, but don't want to murder anyone. Here goes! :)

Gender: Female

Head shape/jaw: Oval shaped face, jaw is quite angular. My forehead is quite prominent and I have a subtle widow's peak.

Eyes: Regular sized but quite round (almond shaped?), and double eyelids (so not monolids like some other asians have)

Eye color: Dark brown, almost black when not in direct sunlight

Eyebrows: Black. quite full, and flat (not arched) with a soft downward slope at the end.

Chin: given that my jaw is kind of angular, my chin is quite tapered and prominent

Mouth: Dull pink. Small and rounded. Very short philtrum. Down-turned if I'm not smiling.

Nose: Prominent, round and a very flat nose bridge. 

Ears: Average sized and prominent lobes that have one piercing on each side. Not very visible from front profile though.

Hair color: Black

Hair style: hair falls just under my collarbones, parted to the left and frames that side of my face. Other side is tucked behind ear. I have a small strip above both ears shaved which joins into an undercut, but it's not very visible with front profile.

Facial hair: None

Skin tone: Olive

Piercings: Just the ears

Tattoos: None

Miscellaneous: Light acne scars on both cheeks, which also gives them a slightly redder appearance. I wear big, circular glasses that are gold coloured.

If anyone does get around to drawing this, I will post a photo of myself to compare! :)

EDIT: omg I'm so glad I found this sub! You guys did so well! You can find what I actually look like in the comments! :)",2019-10-09 17:11:55

Eyes: average, but also kinda wide.

Eye color: Blue to green, there are brownish gold rings around my pupils.

[REQUEST] Male (20) Caucasian with freckles,300,df9hhp,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliceSketchme/comments/df9hhp/request_male_20_caucasian_with_freckles/,52,1570611246.0,"I came here via ask reddit. I tried my best to be as clear as possible but I’m not an English native so it may be a bit unclear at some points. If someone is willing to make a sketch I’ll post a picture of my face.

**Gender:** Male

**Height/build:** 6’3 (191 cm), skinny/muscular. 

**Head shape/jaw:** Pretty strong/wide jawline, slightly asymmetrical meaning meaning my jawline is a little less prominent on the right side of my face.

**Eyes:** on the smaller side, my top eyelid covers 30% of my iris

**Eye color:** blue

**Eyebrows:** my eyebrows in terms of hair growth are pretty average. The colour of the hairs are blonde. They are slightly visible, but you don’t see the “complete outline” of my eyebrow, just the hairs in the middle. 

**Chin:** I have a longer than average chin, and it’s not pointy nor wide

**Mouth:** the corners of my mouth stretch a bit further than the corners of my nose. They are fuller than most people of my skin colour.

**Nose:** Average, maybe slightly below average in size. It is angled up a little which means you can kind of look “into” my nostrils from a front view. 

**Ears:** ears are pretty normal only the top part of my ears bend outwards a little. 

**Hair color:** some people call me ginger, most people don’t. I personally think my hair is more brown than red but I guess it’s somewhere in between. It’s a pretty boring hair colour imo.

**Hair style:** it’s a bit wavy and I put gel in it. Its not like a fade, but the higher you go the longer my hair gets. In my neck and behind my ears it’s about 2/3cm long, on top about 6/7cm. The hear on top I wear to the right and it very slightly covers my forehead.

**Facial hair:** None

**Skin tone:** Very white + I have freckles all over my face. My freckles are orange and even though my face is covered they don’t stand out that much, but again surely visible.

**Piercings:** None

**Tattoos:** None

**Miscellaneous:** None

Chin: Mild buttchin, only thing that really keeps my face from looking like a basketball. 

Mouth: average, not especially big or small. Bottom and upper lips are same size 

Nose: From the side I have a hook or bridge on my nose, you probably know what I’m talking about. The rest of my nose facing me is actually pretty thin and not wide at all.

Hair color: Very dark brown, almost to the point where it’s black.

**Eyebrows:** strong, bushy eyebrows

 **Chin:** fleshy, slightly protruding

**Head shape/jaw:** large, long oval face. Also pretty wide, but longer than wide. Think of an egg or watermelon. Jaw is semi noticeable, but emphasized by a full beard and mustache. However, the beard and mustache do not connect :( slight, nearly unnoticeable traces of acne scars covered by beard. 

 **Eyes:** dark brown eyes. Not big or small, but average. Calm but serious looking with long eyelashes. Slightly sad. Also have a white patch of skin that is a birthmark running down the corner of my right eye to just above my cheek (the corner of my eye next to my nose). Also white birthmarks on both eyelids that make it look like I'm wearing white eyeshadow (so my eyelids are ghostly white). Fairly round pudgy cheeks. 

**Eye color:** dark brown. 

 **Eyebrows:** bushy but not overly so. Angular and compliment my eyes to give a more serious and mean look. Would have a unibrow if I did not pluck. 

**Chin:** Semi angular, it would be the pointy side of an egg. 

**Mouth:** fairly large lips but not crazy. Pronounced lower lip by a bit. Slightly above average sized mouth. 

 **Nose:** big wide Shrek nose. But fairly subdued nostrils. Nose does not stick out, however. 

**Ears:** very long and also pretty wide, but they do not protrude. They are therefore not super noticeable. 

 **Hair color:** black. 

**Hair style:** buzzcut. My angular hairline reduces the watermelon shape of my head.

About an inch or two long. Runs from the bottom of my sideburns to my chin and near my bottom lip. Think of Kratos' new beard but shorter and way more ghetto. Also, stache and beard don't connect.

**Head shape/jaw:** Head is oval shaped, my jaws are mostly round except towards the chin where they tuck in just a little

**Eyes:** My eye shape is pretty normal looking, I think they look relaxed, long eyelashes. Underneath my eyes, I think the area is slightly darker than normal, in the inner corners. The inside corners of my eyes roughly line up with the outer part of my nose, so the spacing is about normal.

**Mouth:** My mouth rests at a pretty neutral position. The lips aren't particularly full. The corners of it end just before my pupils.

**Nose:** I think my nose is a little big, but not THAT big. It looks like a 30-60-90 triangle from the side. It points a little upwards, so that it's a little easier to see my nostrils from the front. It's a little wide. My right nostril is higher than the other.

**Ears:** My ears sit normally/flat against my face, but you usually can't see them behind my hair. Pretty average ears.

I thought it would be cool since our anniversary is coming up in a few days. 

My description of SO:
**Gender:** Male. 

**Head Shape/Jaw:** Oval head shape. Skinny face forehead is slightly square shaped and jaw and chin come to a slight point. 

**Eyes:** almond shape. Squints slightly when smiling and otherwise they are big with long eyelashes. His emotion is always seen in his eyes. 

**Eye Color:** Dark brown, light brown in the sun. 

**Eye Brows:** Long and slightly scruffy. Not too thick.

**Chin:** Slightly pointed chin, with chin dimple in the centre which is very prominent.

**Mouth:** Large lips sort of like jay z. Bottom lip covers the bottom row of teeth when he smiles and top lip is a little smaller than the bottom lip. 

**Nose:** Average sized nose, with button shape. No peculiar shape to it, nose does not hang a certain way.

**Ears:** Long-ish ears that come to the tip of the nose

**Hair Color:** Black.

**Hair Style:** Buzz cut in the process of growing out 

**Facial Hair:** A few hairs under the nose

**Skin Tone:** Slightly tan. Generally olive skin tone.

**Other features:** Tiny dimples in cheek area.

SO's description of me:
**Gender:** Female

**Head Shape/Jaw:** Round head shape, forehead is rounded at the top (not too much). Then as you get towards the jaw the sides of the face run straight down sort of parallel, her jaw comes in really nicely, the jaw starts coming in, in line with her mouth. Her jaw is not sharp by any means but it isn't really wide either, it sort of just finishes her head shape off perfectly. 

**Eyes:** Her eyes are football shaped, sharp towards the end. When her eyes are open I'd say that the width is about 1.5 times the size of the height, but when her eyes are open you can just see most of the pupil, not all of it. Light bags under her eyes. 

**Eye Color:** Dark Brown, but kind of glistens in light, kind of like it's covered in shiny fluid.

**Eye Brows:** On Fleeeek! Perfectly shaped all the time since she takes good care of them. Her eyebrows are thin and uniform and they are not bushy.

**Chin:** Chin comes slightly under her jaw, I'd say about half a centimetre under. It's round and full bit doesn't stick out, it's just there like a cherry embedded on her jaw. 

**Mouth:** Thin lips, bottom lip thicker than the top, but still relatively thin. Very contagious smile, when smiling only top row of teeth show, teeth are nicely shaped and her canines are very sharp, they hang on their bottom lip when she smiles.

**Nose:** Average size nose, about a three quarters of a centimetre distance to each eye. Nostrils aren't large and don't stick out. Very levelled nose, doesn't not point up or down and the width from nostril to nostril would be about the width of one of her eyes.

**Ears:** Average sized ears, are angled towards the back of her head

**Hair Color:** Dark Brown

**Hair Style:** Long, wavy hair Hair that reaches around her mid back/lower back, hair hangs towards the left side of her face covering her ear and just touching the end of her eyebrow.

**Facial Hair:** None. 

**Skin Tone:** Golden Carmel-Like skin.

**Other Features:** Small amount of acne on the cheeks. Beauty spot just above her left nostril. Full, Round cheekbones. Dimples when she smiles.

Gender: Male

Head Shape/Jaw: A bit of roundedness to it, jaws defined by facial hair

Eyes: Deeply dark circles under eyes, half lidded constantly. 

Eye Color: Deeply dark brown, can look black in poor lighting.

Eye Brows: Thick, but not bushy. Naturally well sculpted shape. A few stragglers trying to form a unibrow. Thins out toward the nose on the left side, and a horizontal quarter inch scar on the right eyebrow as it attaches to the nose.

Chin: Not well defined, but roundish. Along with the neck only part that sees any shaving. Three day's stubble has it fairly fuzzy though.

Mouth: Thick and even lips.

Nose: Average length nose. Nose 'points' about thirty degrees upward, giving a look to the nostrils from the front. Round tip. Teardrop shaped nostrils roll out from center.

Ears: Go about from middle of eye to top of upper lip. Unattached earlobes. Lie pretty flat to head and are rarely visible through hair/facial hair.

Hair Color: Brown.

Hair Style: Long and loosely curled. Just shy of the collar bone if pulled straight. Fans out and down from head, not quite heavy enough to pull it straighter.

Facial Hair: Unwaxed handlebar mustache that wings out to be about even with the points of the eyebrow, the parts that are directly over the lips are trimmed to not overlap the lip. 'Friendly chops', or sideburns/chops that connect to the mustache, but a shaved chin. The shaving on the chin goes in a straight line down from the corners of the mouth. Neck is shaved until just below the jawbone. Beard/sideburns are rather close kept until the outer edge of the eyes where it gets about two and a half times as long.

It was interesting to think of how to describe myself, thank you for anyone that draws this.",2015-09-05 16:55:37

We'd be able to submit around 10-12 sketches, each from a different student of the same description. We could split the sketches up for each individual artist or as a group, I suppose that would be up to the mods and/or the requester. Thanks for reading guys, have a great day!

Edit: Wow! I'm really happy about all the feedback the community's given, and how in favor everyone seems to be! Thanks a bunch guys!

Just a couple things. First and foremost, thank you so much for following and supporting this sub. A simple and fun idea I posted on /r/showerthoughts and almost a week later and a great team of mods we're at 2,200+ subscribers. Amazing. 

We have reached out to find more artists for the high demand and have people working on sketches daily. Also we have some announcements to make in the near future for some exciting additions to create even more attention to our Subreddit. 

Furthermore, we've had some great sketches. When you consider that an individual is describing their own facial features and the artist is devoting their time and efforts into essentially a blind interpretation sketch, it's been quite impressive to see the translation. Great work! 

To conclude I personally would like to thank everyone for all the posts and sketches. My goal is to get 100% posts sketched when this sub is past it's infancy stage. This will be done. So please stay tuned and continue to spread the word!

Thanks for your patience and support.

I think his jawline is noticeable, but does not have a defining shape. His nose is an average size, and straight (has not been broken). His nostrils are slightly on the large side- ""not in a bad way but in a just... a nostril way.""

Gender: I am a 22yo Female. I am black although, due to my skin tone and some features when people meet me they ALWAYS ask where I’m from - I guess they think I’m ambiguous or exotic haha. When I ask people to guess they think the typical white/black but also question if I’m part Asian or Oriental.  
(I am actually taking a heritage test soon so I will post my results on a relevant sub since I find people’s impressions interesting!)

Head shape/jaw: 
it’s a mix but mostly diamond/heart I think. Quite bold. Jaw is angled - definitely prominent cheekbones and jaw line (think upside down triangle)

Eyes:
my eyes are quite big and kinda almond shape, if my hair is in a bun or pony tail then they have a almost squinty cat eye look. My eyelids are standard. Eyelashes are quite long and curled up 
My left eye I have one lash that always points down over my eye and you can actually see it in some photos 
Directly under my eyes, like in my waterline I have pockets of fat (think George Clooney) I don’t have hollows or eye bags

Eye color: 
hazel a lot of people think they are green but they are hazel - I guess I pictures with flash they can look brighter

Eyebrows:
brows are standard - usually a bit dark considering I have dyed hair. Neither thick nor thin.
 
My left brow is straighter of the two -
And my right brow is similar but with a slight arch 

Chin: chin tapers to a rounded point 

Mouth: 
Top and bottom lips probably the same volume quite full and plump - top lip is brown bottom like is pink - literally like Kim possible haha 
I have a regular philtrum not super sharp but definitely visible 

Nose: kinda button nose I have a standard high bridge,  the tip is slightly bulbous but it’s upturned slightly - from profile view it is a gentle slope down 

Ears: quite small smaller than most ears, not very noticeable 

Hair color: dyed brown with slightlyyy lighter ends  

Hair style: shortish medium / longer than a bob just reaching shoulders 
Straightened from natural curly hair
Currently parted straight in the middle, fringe/bangs over grown and styled so they swoop and frame my face 

Facial hair: N/A I’m a ladeh 

Skin tone: think Halle Berry, Rihanna, Beyoncé 

Piercings: N/A

Tattoos: N/A

Misc.: 

people say they like my cheekbones they are quite prominent but not overly outrageous 


If my hair is tied up my features are sharper and pointed, I typically tie my hair up if I want to go out because I can do better make up 
In general it pulls my brows higher and my eyes look true almond and sometimes jussssst sometimes I can see why people may think my ancestors may be oriental 

HEIGHT / BUILD - short ! 5’2” / slim-athletic

That’s all I can think of ! So excited to see if anyone tries to draw",2019-10-10 11:40:49

Here goes, so my height is 178cms, my weight is roughly 92kgs.
My head shape has been named anything from squircle, sqaure and I have also been called moon head at school going back 15 years tho, not really sure what it would be.
My nose looks fairly straight from a front on pic but may have a slight bend from the side.
My hairline is slightly higher than average and so is my head size in general, slightly receding hairline in the temple area.
Jawline is bigger than average which I think helps form the squircle shape.
My eyes are blue and average distance apart.
My hair is kind of darkish, blondish, light brownish.
Skin in white, lack of sun and vitamin D light, apart from lacking the sun my skin is healthy and clear and clean.
Over the past year or so I had been taking Finasteride and low does of Spironolactone which both block testosterone (stupid self med idea to stop my hairline receding), so my appearance has turned into more of a male who has a testosterone deficiency (not androgynous tho), which has also resulted in me appearing younger then I am, at least in some photos and light.
In the past when posting on amIugly I have had a number of people liken me to ""the Adoring Fan – Oblivion"" and also a number of others liken me to a younger version of ""Vladimir Putin"" as in similar facial features but a bigger skull.
Hair is reasonably short and would guess 1.5-2.5cms, average ears that don't poke out and not pointy at all.
Definitely not one to ever smile and so my face is always reasonably plain/dull looking, probably due to autism.",2016-03-18 00:28:21

I know this place is kind of dead, but I thought I'd give it a shot since this might be kind of a cool request. I have [prosopagnosia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosopagnosia) (also called faceblindness) which is a condition that makes it difficult or impossible for me to recognize people's faces--even my own! So I thought it would be a neat experiment to describe my own features individually and see what people come up with. Show me what I look like, r/PoliceSketchme! 

**Gender:** Female

**Head shape/jaw:** Long-ish heartshaped face, not quite horse face status. Soft lines. Slightly prominent chin but not Jay Leno status. My face ""sinks in"" on the sides beneath my cheekbones close to my ears. I have dimples on my cheeks on both sides but the one on the left side is much more prominent than the one on the right. 

**Eyes:** : Average eye size and spacing. Dark circles/bags underneath them is a permanent feature. My eyes are pretty lively. No glasses or contacts. 

**Eye color:** Gray

**Eyebrows:** Thin, but not overplucked. Slight pointed arch. 

**Chin:** Slightly more prominent than average from the sideview but not really the front. Tapered but not pointy. Makes my face look long.

**Mouth:** Average thickness, very light pink. If I don't wear makeup they're not very distinguishable from my skin color. Slight upturn even when not actively smiling. Creased smile-laugh lines. 

**Nose:** Kind of large and broad for my face, but not long or smushed looking. Average outward prominence. Very rounded at the tip.

**Ears:** Average to small, they lay mostly flat to the sides of my head. My lobes ""hang"" a little bit. They are pierced once each on the lobes. 

**Hair color:** Medium brown, solid colored without highlights/color dimension. 

**Hair style:** Very very long, past my hips. Slight wave but mostly straight. I usually wear it pinned to one side so it's out of my face, or in two braids. Lots of flyaways. It parts naturally down the center if I don't force it into another style. 

**Facial hair:** None 

**Skin tone:** Light-to-medium Caucasian; I tan very easily but get pretty pale in the winter

**Piercings:** Earlobes only

**Tattoos:** None visible

**Miscellaneous:** Average-to-slightly-underweight. Very broad shoulders. Top teeth are mostly straight but bottom teeth are pretty crooked.

Gender: Male    
Head Shape/Jaw: Ovular. He's got a thin face with a sexy ass butt chin. His forehead area's kind of just a tad bit wide.     
Eyes: Perfectly normal shaped? A little big, perfectly proportionate. Longish eyelashes. His right eye's a bit slanted but not too much.    
Eye Color: Dirty green around the edges with an ombre towards hazel at the center.    
Eye Brows: Dirty blonde color, medium thickness. His left eyebrow seems a bit thicker and closer to the middle. More thick right above the eyes, with less frequent hairs as they go off.    
Chin: BUTT. IT'S A BUTT CHIN. Luscious. Oops he just told me it's a cleft chin. Well shit just found that out. It's a sexy superhero's butt chin.    
Mouth: He kind of tightens it more towards his right side. I don't know how to describe it without sounding lopsided. A nice pink. Both the upper and lower lip seem about the same medium thickness. His lips only stretch to a little past the outskirts of his big ass nose when his mouth is closed but I'll get to that in a second.    
Nose: Big. Pointy. Just an eggplant with little testicles on the side. Still sexy.    
Ears: Normal size and shape. The top is just above his eyebrows and the bottom is just above the nose testicles. He's got a tragus on the right, two lobe piercings on the left.    
Hair Color: Brown on the sides to light brown in the middle.    
Hair Style: So here's the story. Not a long story but when I first met him he always had a beanie on. Whatever. It wasn't until I don't remember when but later. Maybe a week because sometimes he forgets to take the beanie off before we go to sleep. He's 27 so it never really crossed my mind that he was balding but well there you go. Jury's still out on whether I'd still have talked to him or not had I known to begin with. Anyway, there's still thin hairs in the middle, lots of hairs on the side. Right now he has it about two-three inches long.    
Facial Hair: He grows the best facial hair. It's pretty thick. The mustache part's kind of thin. It's same brown as his hair with little blonde and orange hairs throughout.    
Side notes- Maybe the features I've described sound like an unattractive person. I don't know. He has very conventionally attractive features and is just a handsome man. Halfway in between looking like a young twentysomething to a wise midthirtysomething. Maybe that's only because of his blading head. Eh.    

**Boyfriend Z**-    
Gender: Male    
Head Shape/Jaw: not so much wide as big. Smoothly downward wide U-shaped jaw with no butt chin. Almost perfectly symmetrical.    
Eyes: about the same size and shape as mine. The top of his right eyelid droops down just slightly lower than the other.     
Eye Color: a greenish-blue ocean kind of color with a small bit of sand color in the middle of his eye and outer edge.    
Eye Brows: Italian thick. Pretty thick and even across but start to taper at the midway point    
Chin: not pointy, but sort of round while still blending in with the jaw line.    
Mouth: Kind of big pouty looking lower lip whereas the upper lip is very pronounced in the M shape in the middle. the top lip is just a tiny bit thinner than the lower lip.    
Nose: sort of like an anime nose (how they curve inwards towards the face) but NOWHERE near as pronounced as the make them in anime cartoons. More closer to a straight line from the bridge to the tip with and EVER so slight inward curve. While it is thin from a forward prospective with the nostrils being slightly visible. It's perfect.    
Ears: normal ears with big lobes. People used to compare him to a monkey when he was a kid. Perfect to grab onto    
Hair Color: Blonde with very light brown roots    
Hair Style: it is shaved on the sides and back and long on top. the sides are his natural hair color while the top is Khaleesi blonde (it is why he started dying it.. he wanted to be a Targaryen... it's cute) his bangs group in clumps of hair like dreadlocks without them being dreadlocks or mangled and ratty.    
Facial Hair: None. cute baby face all day.

Head Shape/Jaw: Regular? It's like the default head shape you'd see for a Mii

Eyes: Maybe a taaaad bit closer than not.

Eye Color: Brown

Eye Brows: Mostly covered by my hair, but they are also brown and, length wise, are as long as my eye ends but go on for a centimeter more past the end of it, no unibrowing and a moderate arch. They, tbh, look very regular.

Hair Color: Brown, maybe a slight bit darker than generic brown, but definitely brown.

Chin: Not super chisled or anything, but you can determine what's chin and what's not, my face doesn't blend into my chin but my chin isn't overly defined. 

Mouth: Normal, pinkish lips.

Nose: One of my best features, as it is very normal, not overbearing and fits in with my face very normally.

Ears: covered by my hair

Hair Style: Combover, but I do it with my fingers as opposed to a comb. Think Ian from Smosh, but the hair going the other way. It comes down to about the middle of my eyebrows.

Facial Hair: I have a beard, I shave off the neck part and the moustache so it's just a beard. It's not 3D or anything, it isn't defined, but it's there and it's brown and it's semi thick. Thick enough to the point that I'm not embarrassed by it, but not ""high school junior trying to grow a beard"" thin.

Skin Tone: Slightly tanner than white. I'm a quarter Assyrian (Modern day Iran) and it shows only a bit. I'd define myself as white, always have, but you can tell I'm not like straight out of Ireland or anything. ",2015-09-05 17:41:41

Height: 6'2""

Weight: 235lbs

Head shape/jaw:  Long oval shaped head. High, but not receding forehead.
I am on the heavier side but have lost a ton of weight, I don’t have a typical fat man face – thankfully, but still have ruddier cheeks. Think sort of like a young Santa Claus. Or like what an actual bear would look like if it were a human. 

Eyes: My eyes are relatively normal sized, almond-ish shape. They are at relatively normal space apart, but probably leaning on the slightly closer together side. When I smile they look a little squinty. 

Eye color: Brown

Eyebrows: Dark brown, with some blonde and a gray hair in my right one. They are big, broad, and fully but not wild looking. They kind of look like this ~ except a more pounced downward side. 

Chin: I have a large square-ish pointed chin and jawline, but it is covered by my beard and my little bit of fat. Have a slight double chin, that is also covered by the beard. 

Mouth: light pink. Wide, normal sized lips. Not thin, not large. Top and bottom are about the same. 

Nose: I have a straight normal to slightly large nose. The nostrils are proportionate. The nose tip points out straight, and is lightly rounded. A relatively normal looking nose. 

Ears: Normal sized. Connected earlobe. Slight rectangular / pointed tops. 

Hair color: Straight dark brown hair, with some slight grays. I use pomade in my hair so it looks darker. Sides are buzzed, so at most a very fine touch of light stubble. 

Hair style: I have the slightly hip hairstyle of buzzed sides and back, with the hair slicked back and to the right side with pomade. Causing it to go up a little in the front. Think the 1940s style hair, but with a beard.  I have a high, but not receding hairline with a widows peek, in other words I have a big forehead. 

Facial hair: I have a neatly trimmed beard, about a 3 on clippers. Disconnected sole patch. Moustache is connected looks almost like this almost [ but of course turned downward. Mostly dark brown, with hints of blonde. 

Skin tone: White, with a slightly pinkish yet slight olive tone. 

Piercings: None

Tattoos: None on my face. 

Miscellaneous: Scar almost smack dab in the middle of my forehead, at a slight slant. It Is old and faded but still noticeable. I have a mole close to the right side of my nose.

I've had a lot of fun doing some sketches here but unfortunately it seems to be dying down a bit. So here's a description of me, and hopefully some of you have fun sketching it! I tried to be as descriptive as possible.



Gender: Female


Age: 22


Race: Caucasian, and quite pale but not ghostly


Head Shape/Jaw: I have a mostly round face shape, like a circle that has been slightly stretched out length-wise so it's not a perfect circle, but not quite an oval either. I am also overweight which adds more roundness to my face (chubby cheeks, soft jawline, etc.) I don't usually have a double chin unless I'm looking down. My forehead is completely average; not big, not small, just there (which has made me flip flop my entire life on whether or not I should try out bangs)


Eyes: A little small in comparison to my face, almond shaped, almost completely hooded (but not monolid), no white on the top of bottom of my iris, not too close together but not far apart either, I'd say maybe 1.5 eye lengths between the eyes, but since they're small it doesn't seem like a huge distance. No dark circles unless I'm abnormally tired, but a little puffy under the eyes, especially if I smile. Thin, sparse eyelashes on top, invisi-lashes on the bottom.


Eye Color: Hazel, but mostly just look like light brown. If you look really close they have some little speckles but you'd have to look pretty close.


Eye Brows: Dark brown, not abnormally thick but pretty full. Not bushy. Begin at my tear duct, end just past my eye. Arched, but not severely. They slant upward until the end of my eye then arch back down. You can see individual hairs at the middle but then they thicken and darken out.


Chin: Just kind of blends into my round jawline. The roundness squares off ever so slightly where my chin is, for about the same width as my mouth.


Mouth: Pretty thick lips, enough to garner comments from people, but not like Angelina Jolie thick. A little wider than my nose, top lip and bottom lip are about the same thickness, but the bottom lip is round and the top lip has a cupid's bow that stretches out and almost disappears when I smile. I have a small freckle that you probably wouldn't notice right above the right side of my lip


Nose: Average width bridge, but the nose itself is quite large, round, and bulbous. It's more bulbous on the right side, with a pronounced ridge where it meets the nostril, my parents say that's from shoving an entire crumpled up napkin up the right nostril when I was little and leaving it there for a month. Nostrils are the same size though, and not particularly wide themselves, and they are not visible from straight on, but are slightly from the side. Not abnormally long, but definitely not flat. From the side looks just slightly larger than average size, just round, not a perfectly straight bridge from the side, curves slightly inward.


Ears: Almost never visible with my hair, at least not entirely. Lobe is aligned with the nostril and is unattached. The top ends at my eyebrows. Flat against my head. One lobe piercing in each, rarely wear earrings though.


Hair Color: Medium-dark brown.


Hair Style: Very thick, naturally varies between straight and wavy. Very long, goes about to my belly button or just above my tailbone. I have some long but barely noticable layers, just enough to make it V in the back instead of being squared off. No bangs. Parted so that more hair is on the right side of my face, the part is pretty deep, lining up with the arch of my right eyebrow.


Other: Black horn rimmed glasses with no frames on the bottom (I'm blind as a bat without them so they are always on), small septum ring. When I wear makeup I wear black winged liner and sometimes dark lipstick",2015-09-13 10:23:21

Head Shape/Jaw: Somewhere between oval and rectangular shaped. I don't really have a square jaw though, it's kind of rounded and tapers in ever so slightly. I don't have an angular chin, it's kind of flat (horizontally) when looking at my face straight on. I guess my lower jaw and chin are slightly larger than normal proportion to the rest of my face. I have a really high forehead (fiveheads club whatup!!), really defined and high cheekbones, but a rather short midface. I don't have chubby cheeks at all, in fact my midface is slightly flattened. 

Eyes: Small in size. Almond shaped, and tilt kind of upwards near the outward ends. Slightly close to one another, but nothing too drastic...I'd say they're still a fairly normal distance apart. They're pretty deep set though with a good amount of space between my eyes and my eyebrows (vertical distance). I have some pretty intense shadowing happening in the spot between my eyes (on each side of the bridge of my nose). Also, dark circles. 

Eye Color: Blue/green

Eye Brows: On the thick side and are kind of flat with a very mild arch. They extend past the outer edge of my eyes. They are normally distanced (no unibrow) and are well kept/tidy.

Chin: Protrudes more outward rather than downward (if you were to look from a side profile). It's not necessarily large with regards to the rest of my facial proportions, but my entire lower jaw in general is sliiiightly more prominent than my upper jaw(midface). No cleft and is not angular. 

Mouth: Thicker upper lip with most of the fullness in the middle. My upper lip is kind of like a mountain peak in that the middle is much fuller compared to the outer ends. Not a very prominent cupid's bow. Well defined philtrum and not a lot of space between my upper lip and my nose. My lower lip is on the thin side, but not non-existent either. It's pretty flat (horizontally). 

Nose: Slight ski jump. My septum dips very slightly below my nostrils, but not too far past them. Nostrils are not flared or overly visible. Even though my nose is kind of small, it's not really short in terms of length from my eyebrows to the tip. I have a high bridged nose (mostly due to my flattened midface/upper jaw).  

Ears: Typical female ears. Nothing stands out about them.

Hair Color: Blonde with some natural strawberry blonde peaking through.

Hair Style: Long, straight, and on the thinner side. I have side bangs (not the straight across kind). 

Facial Hair: zero (hopefully)

Skin Tone: Very fair. A few freckles on my nose. I have pretty prominent nasolabial fold lines.

(Note: thanks so much to whoever sketches me! I think this is the coolest thing...especially since I've been diagnosed with body dysmorphia, so I'm really curious to see how this turns out)

Gender: Female

Head Shape/Jaw: My face is somewhat heart-shaped.  My jaw bones are slightly defined, but more soft than sharp.  

Eyes: Averaged size, almond shaped.  The distance between my eyes are one eye length. My eye lids are slightly hooded.  The area below my tear ducts is slightly darker, like dark circles, but only in that spot.  
Eye Color:  green.

Eye Brows:  full (not too thick), classically arched 2/3 of the length from where they start above the tear duct. They extend beyond my eyes a bit.

Nose: Some would say a button nose, not upturned but a very small hook. The bridge is like slope (not flat, and not a hump). Nostrils are proportionate to the rest. 

Cheeks:  full cheeks but not round. somewhat defined cheek bones. I have a beauty mark above my lip on my right side, where monroe piercings are normally placed. 
 
Chin: A bit smaller than average, sort of round. It is slightly lower than my jawbones.  There is a small shadow on chin below my bottom lip.

Mouth: My upper lip is a little thin but has a large cupids bow.  The ends of my mouth curl up a little at the ends.  My bottom lip is fuller in proportion to my top lip, gets fuller near the middle.  When my lips are closed I always look happy.  My teeth are more square than rectangular, and straight.

Ears: Normal sized ears.  two earrings in each ear, I usually wear small stones on the second hole and slightly larger stones on the first.

Hair Color: Lightest pale ash blonde. ""fine thin hair""

Hair Style: The part is on my right.  It is cut about 1.5 inches above my shoulders.  It has choppy layers between my chin and the bottom.  My bangs are long.  Usually my hair looks beachy or ""tousled"" . My dad would say it is a mess.

Thank you to who ever may choose to draw me! I hope I will be confident enough to try to draw someone in the future :) Other than that.....stay cheerful!

Gender: Female

Head Shape/Jaw: I have an oval face. My forehead is strong, a little bigger than normal, but still looks proportional to the rest of my face. I would say that if you follow my jawlines, thy would meet in about a 90 degree angle under my chin. My chin is strong, but does not overwhelm my face in the least. It is very slightly squared off with the most minute cleft in the middle. I have round, full blushing cheeks.

Eyes: I have classic almond- shaped eyes that are not the showcase of my face by any means. They seem to just mesh with the rest of my face. My eyelids are slightly hooded, but it is harder to notice, since I am young. My irises are in proportion to the rest of my eye.

Eye Color: I have green eyes. The green isn't exceptionally beautiful, more olive toned than anything.

Eye Brows: My eyebrows start at my tear duct and end at the line that can be made with my nostril being a point and the outer corner of my eye being another point on the same line. I have a nice arch, a very smooth curve above the outer corner of my eye. My brows are not harsh, but are thick enough to frame my face.

Mouth: I have full lips. My bottom lip is juicy and plump. My top lip is smaller than the bottom, but still a good size. I don't have too much of a cupid's bow, but there is a little dip in the center of my top lip. My lips are the star of my face, but they are not overwhelming.

Nose: I have a strong nose. The bridge is straight and mildly thin. The tip is slightly bigger than the bridge, and slightly more bulbous. the nostrils are very average. The nose is not too big for my face.

Ears: The bottom of my ears come to the bottom of my nose, but the rest are covered by hair.

Hair Color: Very light, cool-toned blonde. I have dark blonde roots that are about 2.5 inches long.

Hair Style: My hair is about 3 inches past my shoulders. It is thick and full, but straight. I have very long cut bangs. My bangs swoop on the right side of my face, brushing my eyebrow. My part is on the deep left of my head. 

Thank you in advance for anyone who draws me! I will post a picture for any comparisons later. :)",2015-09-11 17:53:37

Head Shape/Jaw: Very square head jaw, big ""norski"" head as described by my grandfather. Highish cheek bones, longish face, very flat profile. About average proportion features with larger forehead/hairline. Roundish/chubby face slightly. No hard angles.

Eyes: Very almond shaped, slightly uptilted, smallish eyelids, Short eyelashes and naturally darker skin around where eyeliner would go. One small wrinkle under bottom eyelashes.

Eye Color: Very pale blue/grey with a dark limbal ring and generally large pupils. Very similar to Saorise Ronan.

Eye Brows: Maybe slightly thicker than normal, but short, only being a little longer than the length of my eye. Slight arch, but mostly flat.

Chin: Very rounded off into my jaw, not very prominent. But a rather deep crease between mouth and chin.

Mouth: Slightly smaller than average, if you drew a line down from the inside edge of my pupil it would hit there. Very thin top lip with strong/triangular cupids bow and flat bottom. Bottom lip is very full and like a squared off semi-oval with a dimple coming up under it.
 
Nose: Very much a button nose. It is somewhat short and a bit wide. The cartilage is not very defined, it almost looks like a baby's nose. It has a v shape indented on the tip. Looking at me front on you can't see the bottom of my nose/nostrils.

Ears: My ears are actually too low on my head so they line up with the bottom of my eyes and mouth. This is why they are almost always hidden by my hair. Normal ears besides that. 

Hair Color: Golden blonde with light blonde at ends

Hair Style: Very long, about elbow length. Long wavy layers with a deep left side part that flips out just under my eye.

Facial Hair: Smooth as baileys from a shoe

Skin Tone: Pale olive toned skin, very much from my Ukrainian side.

Other: I have a largeish mole just beside my left nostril and two moles on my right cheek in a diagonal line that line up horizontally with my mouth and chin crease.",2015-09-06 18:52:17

"[Meta] Reviving the sub - CSS, rules, post formatting, AutoModerator!",7,5z62v2,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliceSketchme/comments/5z62v2/meta_reviving_the_sub_css_rules_post_formatting/,1,1489452384.0,"^*and* ^*knuckles*

&nbsp;

# Welcome back!

First off, welcome back to the subreddit. It's been a *long* time since there was any sort of action here. I sincerely hope that we didn't lose *all* of you, and the ones still interested in the subreddit (artist or not) still wish to participate.

&nbsp;

## What's up, buttercup?

A lot, actually. For the past week I've been working on getting /r/PoliceSketchme ***right.*** That means I've worked on the CSS, created some solid rules, a format for sketch requests to follow, and set up AutoModerator to actually be helpful. All in all, it's all work that should have been done at the initial creation of the subreddit.

&nbsp;

### Changes to the way the subreddit works

*groan* Yes, change usually sucks. Nobody really likes it. But I personally think the changes to here will be well received, and suggestions are definitely welcome.

1. **Rules**

 Rules have finally gotten a solid form, and are fairly well detailed. You may see them in the sidebar. TL;DR for them though: 
 * Follow [""Describe Yourself format""](https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliceSketchme/wiki/describeyourselfformat) when requesting a sketch
 * You ***MUST*** include a comparison picture of yourself in the *original* request post
 * Post titles MUST include a tag
 * Artists *may* leave a link to donate
 * No trolling/memes
 * Be civil and friendly
 * No URL shorteners or affiliate links
 * Do *not* spam in any way
 * *No politics*

2. **The ""Describe Yourself format""**

 This is something that *sort of* was a thing, but wasn't truly enforced or always followed how it should be. Basically, the DYF (Describe Yourself format) is a template you can fill in with the details of yourself. It has all of the relevant information which is required when an artist attempts to sketch you. By following the DYF, you *should* receive an accurate sketch.

3. **AutoModerator**

 AutoModerator will enforce all of the above rules, as well as enforcing formatting for titles and post length for the `[Discussion]` tag. AutoModerator will also leave a *(hopefully)* helpful comment on your post for when you don't either follow the DYF, title formatting guidelines, or a majority of the rules in general.

4. **Tags**

 There's now only two tags users should need to ever use. They've been slimmed down to `[Request]` and `[Discussion]`. Use as needed.

5. **Submitting a sketch**

 Done. Gone. Out the window. No longer will the sub be clogged up with `[Sketch]` making it harder to find the requests. Instead, you'll post the sketch in the request thread *just like everyone originally wanted!* Obviously, this means your sketches won't exactly get as much attention or recognition. Luckily, we thought of that and we present:

6. **Weekly Showcase**
 The Weekly Showcase is going to be a thread which is posted here once a week, with a list of the moderators favorite five sketches which were submitted. They aren't listed in any particular order.

 There will be a sticky comment in the thread which links to a Straw Poll. There, users will vote for their favorite sketch. At the end of the week (probably the day before the next Showcase), the sketch will be posted *outside* of the thread as a `[Sketch]`. *This will be the only time that tag should be used.*

7. **CSS**

 There's some of that now. Enjoy my terrible CSS coding skills. I managed to get RES Night Mode ""working"" as well. So you have that, should you choose  to use it. There's some issues which need to be worked out with it still, but I believe they're minimal.

&nbsp;

### ""I'm new here, what *is* this, and what are you talking about?

&nbsp;

#### Some background

/r/PoliceSketchMe was originally a post created in /r/ShowerThoughts by the user /u/McWitt. The original post [can be found here](https://np.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/3jnupt/there_should_be_a_subreddit_where_you_describe/). He described the idea as “a subreddit where you describe your facial characteristics, and sketch artists draw what they think you look like. Then you post your picture afterwards”. This is what the subreddit was built around, and within a day it had gained over 500 subscribers. Soon to follow, 1000.

Unfortunately, such a large influx of people wanting to participate in the subreddit was very hard to deal with. AutoModerator had yet to be properly configured to help keep the peace, rules were barebones and hard to enforce, and users didn’t always follow the guidelines properly, causing confusion and frustration.

Eventually, this all led to the subreddit’s inevitable demise, and submissions of all types stopped coming in. As of now, it sits purely as something to look back on and enjoy what was achieved in the short time it was successful.

#### So basically...

You follow a post format called the ""Describe Yourself format"" which can be [found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliceSketchme/wiki/describeyourselfformat). If you follow it correctly, you should eventually receive a sketch by one of the many talented artists who drop by here.

---

# Anyway, enough of my rambling!

Everything *should* be all set and ready to go and run. If something doesn't quite work right, please don't hesitate to [contact the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FPoliceSketchme) here! You'll get a response as soon as one of us is available. Me personally, I have no life and basically live on reddit so chances are, you'll get a response from me.

-Mouth is average, the kind you'd see on a mannequin.

-Ears are pretty standard. Special note: they help with my hearing.

[Discussion] Helpful tip when describing!,7,dfm8h0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliceSketchme/comments/dfm8h0/discussion_helpful_tip_when_describing/,2,1570678952.0,"Just found this sub and I love this concept so much! As an artist I'd love to get into this when I have time, but! one thing I noticed when looking through profiles was a lack of descriptions of proportions and distance between facial features. 
A super defining trait that makes a lot of people individuals is the height at which their nose, mouth, eyes, and eyebrows sit, as well as how far apart they are from each other.

Would really appreciate someone giving it a go!

&#x200B;

\*\*Gender:\*\* Female (mid teens)

&#x200B;

\*\*Head shape/jaw:\*\* I have a mostly oval head shape, with a slightly large forehead but not super noticeable. Quite typical jawline that curves in around 2/3rds of the way down from my ears.

&#x200B;

\*\*Eyes:\*\* Standard shape and spacing, but my right eye is sliiiightly smaller than my left. It's pretty subtle though.

&#x200B;

\*\*Eye color:\*\* Blue

&#x200B;

\*\*Eyebrows:\*\* Quite pathetic honestly. They're a decent shape - average width, slightly curved - but also blonde so they don't really show up :/

&#x200B;

\*\*Chin:\*\* Round.

&#x200B;

\*\*Mouth:\*\* Average size. My lips are naturally quite a dark pink in comparison to my skin tone. Tends to go to a slight smile when I'm not making any specific expression.

&#x200B;

\*\*Nose:\*\* Very standard nose. Mostly straight and curves up a little at the end.

&#x200B;

\*\*Ears:\*\* Nothing notable here, just normal ears.

\*\*Hair color:\*\* Dark blonde and slightly red. Basically a mix of blonde/brown/red, but the most prominent colour depends on the lighting where I am.

&#x200B;

\*\*Hair style:\*\* Wavy, mid-length hair that reaches maybe 5-10 cm below my shoulders. Either side of my face at the front, I have a shorter sort of fringe that reaches to about the bottom of my ears.

[Request] I saw this sub on the AskReddit so I'm here to see how good I truly am at describing myself!,9,dfbwe5,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliceSketchme/comments/dfbwe5/request_i_saw_this_sub_on_the_askreddit_so_im/,0,1570623790.0,"I am trying to see how well I can describe myself, so the way I describe some things may get pretty creative. Let's see how close I can truly get!

I copy and pasted  [u/Maybeiwillbeokay](https://www.reddit.com/user/Maybeiwillbeokay/) 's post, just changed my answers because I couldn't find a real definite set of categories to describe myself in, so the format is borrowed! Thanks

**Gender:** Male

**Height/Build:** 5'10"", I weigh 125 pounds, so I would say I am rather slim.

**Head shape/jaw:** I have a more oval-shaped head, but I have a more defined jawline, and then it flattens out near the chin.

**Eyes:** I would say that my eyes are what people would draw when drawing the ""stereotypical"" eye. They aren't squinty, but they aren't big and buggy either. maybe slightly more buggy than normal, but I would say that they are normal. I wear frameless glasses, (means the legs of the glasses connect directly to the lens, and the lens are directly connected by the nose piece) and they  are medium-sized, the top of the lens are almost perfectly in line with the bottom line of my eyebrows, and the bottom of the lens are kind of like my jawline, they are more flat on the bottom but on either side of a particular lens it is angled, but its a more natural curved transition to the flat bottom rather than the sharp angles like with my jaw.

**Eye color:** My eyes are Hazel

**Eyebrows:** My eyebrows are a curved shape, and they are full. near the inside of the eyebrows, my eyebrow hairs start to fray straight up rather than follow the curve of the rest of the hair. It's only like 5-10 hairs that do it, so it's not a super large area that sticks up. They are a natural darker shade of red, but sketches are normally done in pencil so I do not think that will change the sketch very much haha.

**Chin:** My chin protrudes from my face just slightly, and it is a butt chin, but very unnoticeable butt chin. It's not a very dominant feature of my chin, and can only be truly noticed from certain angles.

**Mouth:** The ends of my mouth line up with the middle of my eyes, the dead middle of my mouth curves down, then on either side it curves back up a little bit, then going further out it curves down a little less, and the finally the tips curve back up to a point, and this is the resting position of my mouth. The curves are not very prominent, its almost like a very very flat ""s""

**Nose:**  After asking some people to help me describe my nose because I couldn't find the words to describe it, and so far I am just hearing that it is a very normal nose. Nothing too abnormal about it, I would say that there isn't really much of curve to it from the front, the edge of the nostrils form almost a straight line to the top of the nose, so I guess its more triangular, but with more rounded angles/corners

**Ears:** I would say pretty normal, but 99% of the time I wear a red Neff branded style beanie, so my ears are rarely seen.

**Hair color:** natural red, but slightly on the darker side. in the light, it looks like a more normal red.

**Hair style:** The hair on the top of my head is about 1.5 times longer than the width of my hand, so I would say it is more medium length. The hair on the sides and back of my head is buzzed, not bald, but short enough to see the scalp. When I am not wearing the beanie, my hair is in a small pun position to the crown of my head. With my beanie on, the hair is just slicked back under the beanie, with only about an inch of my bangs showing.

**Facial hair:** Very small about on the flat part of my chin and a mustache that spans the length of my mouth, but the hair isnt very full, and its also red so its hard to notice a lot of the hair unless it is really looked at.

**Skin tone:** White, more on the paler side, fair skin. Comes with being a redhead

**Piercings:** None

**Tattoos:** None

**Miscellaneous:** nothing really

I tried clicking the flair button at the bottom of this while creating it, but it says ""Not available for this community"" so I am resorted to typing the request in the title, I have been on Reddit a while but have rarely ever posted, so I am practically new to it. If someone could help me with that, that would be great! Edit: I posted it and it added the flair itself, so now I feel silly haha",2019-10-09 20:23:10

[Request] Sketch me please! 23 Caucasian female.,6,3ly8za,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliceSketchme/comments/3ly8za/request_sketch_me_please_23_caucasian_female/,7,1442967161.0,"**Gender:** Female

**Head Shape/Jaw:** Round face, double chin (overweight), probably would be more heart shaped at a lower weight.

**Eyes:** Almond shaped eyes. One eye lid hangs slightly lower than the other (like, a very small amount), causing one eye to be a little bit darker. I have tear troughs [like this](http://www.mrdavidcheung.com/cosmetic/teartroughfillers_files/stacks_image_5699.jpg), and I think they are sunken in. 

**Eye Color:** Right eye is medium brown, left eye is closer to an amber colour

**Eye Brows:** Thin. Not overly arched. Right eyebrow goes up a bit more than the other when smiling. I think they're a bit sparse. 

**Chin:** Distinct, but still a double chin if that makes sense? I think it would be more pointy if I wasn't overweight. Bottom lip to chin is about an inch. In normal lighting, there is a small shadow under my bottom lip. 

**Mouth:** A little wider than my nose. Top lip is smaller than my bottom lip. My top lip is a little bit pointy shape wise--it looks like there's not much lip between the side of my mouth to the tips, and there it gets much more full. Bottom lip has a freckle slightly off centre to the right where my lip ends (skin/lips meets). Naturally soft pink. Small scar (1/2 inch) above left upper lip, just a thin white line (from a dog bite as a child).

**Nose:** A little bit shorter than an average nose length. Frenulum is probably a bit more noticeable than average. From the front, it looks like I have an upturned/button nose, but from the side, it is comepletely straight. Nostrils can be seen head on. Bridge of nose is narrow and tip of nose wider--not in an exaggerated way, though.

**Ears:** Round ears with attached earlobes. They don't stick out far and from straight on, mostly just a little bit of my earlobe is visible. Middle of eye is in line with top of ears, bottom of ears is in line with top of lips. 

**Hair Color:** Medium brown hair.

**Hair Style:** Past shoulders/boob length. Parted deeply to the left side. Long ""layers"" (my bangs currently go past my chin). Hair has a wave to it. 

**Facial Hair:** N/A

**Other:** Have a beauty mark/birth mark on left cheek, in line with the bottom of my nose and the left corner of my left eye. Pale skin. Half italian, half dutch. 

Thanks everyone!

My name is Bryn, I am a lurker but heard about this sub from a friend (who had a pretty spectacular sketch done) and wanted to give it a go!

Gender: Female

Head Shape/Jaw: Round head shape on top, but generally very angular jaw shape. Oval head all-around. Pretty strong cheekbones, strong square jaw, very defined jawline, soft but definite cleft in chin. Cheekbones are widest part of face, jaw is shifted ever so slightly to the left.

Eyes: Small, almond-shaped eyes. Very small lids, you can barely see them when I'm not wearing makeup. Eyelashes are long and curly but not necessarily very thick. Sometimes I get self-conscious that they are slightly too close together, but this doesn't necessarily stand out.

Eye Color: Somewhere between green and hazel.

Eye Brows: Far away they appear thin, but close-up they are thicker and well-groomed. Substantial arc, begginning thick and smoothing to be relatively thin on the outer edges. You can tell that I follow typical female eyebrow grooming standards. Dark brown hair.

Chin: Strong, cleft but not harshly.

Mouth: The ""fullness"" of my lips is about the width of my nose, and the corners of my lips, which tilt up at the very ends, reach about the middle/outer edge of my irises. Full bottom lip, almost as full upper lip with a definite but shallow bow. Lips are generally a soft pink but the color dissipates on the sides of my bottom lips where they begin tapering in.

Nose: Ski-jump nose, but you can't tell from the front. I'd say that the fullest part of my nose, around the nostrils, is between a third and a fourth of the width of my face. Has a reddish tint to it. The bridge is a little more delicate/small than the tip in every direction. 

Ears: Unattached earlobes. Nothing special. Don't stick out really. Go from iris to notstril, I think...

Hair Color: Dark brown.

Hair Style: Shoulder-length, loose curls. The hair in my face is about chin-length, and the texture usually forms very long, loose finger-waves. Parted on the left, pretty far over. Above arch of left eye.

Facial Hair: none (hopefully)

Complexion: Super pale! Rosy cheeks/nose. Very light freckles, with darker freckles up near the corner of my left eye on the cheekbone.

Characteristics: light dusting of freckles all over, especially on nose.
I think from here I should say that the most defineable feature, in my opinion, is that my jaw/nose jut forward so much. Not in an underbite kind of way, but... I dunno, I've always heard that I look slavick, like I could be a young russian woman in a movie easily. I know I have irish and polish in my blood. But yeah, I guess there's something about the lower half of my face that can feel kinda masculine in pictures because my whole jaw/mouth is so strong. But you can really only see that noticeably from the side anyway. I also have small but very definite dimples right off the corner of my lips when I smile. My eyes disappear when I smile. Small straight teeth, lots of gum when I grin. My smile takes over my face.

Celebrity look-alikes: I've heard Kate Beckinsale, and Liv Tyler. Totally Liv's eyes. But I also think Claire Danes shares a jaw/cheekbone/chin structure with me.

Hopefully this isn't too detailed! I started to have a lot of fun with the studying of my own face. So many new things discovered. Thanks PoliceSketchMe! Hopefully I'll have time to do some sketches of you folks as well!",2015-09-07 11:19:30

I'm just really curious to see if y'all can get me right! I would be honored to be drawn by any of you talented people :) I hope I described my face accurately- is it bad that I had to look in a mirror so much to describe my own face?

Gender: female

Head shape/jaw: very round. About as round as a head can feasibly be. Jaw is pretty normal I think, but my cheekbones are not too well defined, and I have rounded cheeks.

Eyes: Rounded shape. Lashes are really long but they’re not super thick and I almost always wear mascara (but that’s it for makeup). My eyes are slightly different shapes: you can see a little more of my right eyelid than my left. The difference is minor, though. Slight creases under the eyes, from exhaustion, probably

Eye color: dark blue

Eyebrows: fairly thin, medium brown. They slant up in a fairly straight line before arching down about ¾ of the way through. My right eyebrow fades out earlier than my right.

Chin: fairly round, but is a little flat at the bottom.

Mouth: very full lips my top lip is slightly larger than my bottom with cupid’s bow.

Nose: fairly normal, a little thin, but rounded (sensing a pattern?) at the bottom. It's kind of upturned at the end, my mom calls it a ski-jump nose.

Ears: can’t usually see them through my hair.

Hair color: medium brown

Hair style: Wavy, like brushed-out curls. I usually just wear it down and parted on the right. Some flyaways on the top

Facial hair: none

[Request] 28 M Caucasian [Extreme Difficutly],7,dffsoz,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliceSketchme/comments/dffsoz/request_28_m_caucasian_extreme_difficutly/,3,1570650031.0,"**Gender:** Male

**Head shape/jaw:** Very large & long head with a skinny neck. Huge forehead.

My jaws are really big and uneven (the right one is much bigger than the left one) which makes my chin unaligned with my face. They make my head look very angular, although their angle is pretty round due to my masseters (jaw muscle) being swollen, especially the right one. This makes my right jaw stick out, almost comically.

**Eyes:**  My eyes are ""normal"" shaped for a caucasian person. There is nothing particular about their spacing. However, I look very, very tired. I have bags under the eyes, they're deep and blue. The space between my upper eyelids and my eyebrows is all ""puffy"", like someone who just woke up (but forever). My right eye is slightly smaller and puffier than the left one. My upper eyelids cover more surface of my eyeballs than they should, making me look even more tired.

**Eye color:**  Brown

**Eyebrows:**  Brown. My eyebrows are definitely on the broad ~~size~~ side, but they are long enough and have a nice curve to them.

**Chin:**   My chin is nice, square and of normal lenght, although it makes a sharp angle with my jaws and is misaligned (to the left).

**Mouth:**  My mouth is a little small, which is accuented by the fact that my jaw is so large (nothing crazy though). It is also slightly off-axis, with my lower lip sliding a bit to the left (following my jaw unevenness). My lips aren't thin, but I wouldn't called them big either.

**Nose:**  My nose is straight and of normal size. It actually kind of brings my face together, one of the rare attractive features on my face imo, along with my large cheekbones.

**Ears:** There isn't much to say about my ears tbh.

**Hair color:**  I have straight, brown hair. I am starting to have quite a bit of gray hair on the sides, right above my ears (not completely gray hair locks, more like dispersed gray hairs).

**Hair style:** Since I am balding (receding hairline on the sides, still sort of ok in the middle), I keep my hair long enough to cover my forehead from the left to the right. It doesn't look very good because it is obvious I am using hair from the side of my head to do that. My hair is otherwise cut simple and clean.

**Facial hair:** I have a few days old beard. It isn't very dense, but it is evenly spread, except on the center of my chin which has a hairless spot.

**Skin tone:**  Very pale. My skin makes me look much older than I really am, I almost look like I could be in my fourties.

**Piercings:**  /

**Tattoos:**  /

**Miscellaneous:** I have very unpleasing wrinkles that go from the side of my nostrils to the extremities of my mouth. It makes me look grumpy/pissed off all the time.

I also have two moles on the left cheek. One is right in the middle of my cheek, at mouth height. It is about as large as a smartie. The other mole is at mid-distance between my nose and my ear. It is about half the size of the other one.",2019-10-10 03:40:31

**Head Shape/Jaw:** Large round, prominent forehead which creates the illusion of having a longer face than normal. The bones going down either side of my forehead are very noticeable in pictures and harsh light. Face shape is sort of on the skinnier side, culminating in a wide-ish chin. Think a little more than an inch wide. Prominent jawline due to skinny genetics.

**Eyes:** The shape of my eyes are very round, with pointed corners. They are also the main contributor to an intense resting face, which has intimidated some who don't know me. 

**Eye Color:** Blue/green, with a dark ring around the outer edge of both eyes.

**Eye Brows:** Light strawberry-blonde in color, very average looking in shape. Not pointed, not rounded, not straight, just average.

**Chin:** Described in the Head Shape. There is a large dip between that and my lower lip, and also a round exterior, I don't know how that happened.

**Mouth:** Somewhat wider than my chin, but not by much. Thick lips for a guy, with a deep philtrum, about the width of my pinkie finger. A single freckle on my bottom lip.

**Nose:** Big from the side, but not really from the front. Round tip, and nostrils that are slightly upturned, making them look somewhat large. The bridge of the nose starts immediately protruding between my eyes, and doesn't stop getting further out until the tip.

**Ears:** Detached lobes, with a *slight* point at the top of the lobe. Point at the top of the lobe begins under eyebrows, and the bottom of the earlobe is at the bottom of my nostrils. My right ear sticks out a little bit more than the left, but the left doesn't stick out much at all.

**Hair Color:** Red, motherfuckers.

**Hair Style:** Thick hair in general. Hairstyle pretty close to what every other guy has these days, long on the top, shaved on the sides and the back. The top of my hair is poofy and wavy, but controlled and pushed back slightly to my left. 

**Facial Hair:** Sideburns, coming down to the ends of the ears on the side of my face. The rest of my facial hair is predominantly on my neck and jawline, so I shave it religiously. All facial hair is the same color as my head hair.

**Other:** Semi-prominent cheekbones, and noticeable laugh lines around the mouth and eyes. Overall, I have a babyface for my age, but an upper facial structure that makes me look mean. Pale skin with A TON of freckles, thanks to my Irish ancestors. I am also American, if that makes any difference.

Gender: Male

Head Shape/Jaw: Round head on top, oval shaped face and chinthe chin. Cheekbones are slightly noticable, and cheeks have a bit of pudge to them. Jawline is nothing impressive.

Eyes: Almond-shaped eyes. They look kinda small in comparison to my nose, but are really rather average sized. Slight tired-lines.

Eye color: Dark brown. So dark, It's hard to differentiate between the iris and pupil from a glance.

Eye brows: Thick and bushy with only a slight curve to them. If I don't wax and trim, I get a unibrow.

Chin: Juts out of my face into kind of a rounded point.

Mouth: Pink lips, protruding out just a bit. About the width of my (big) nose. Both lips are fairly the same size. Shallow frenulum, covered by facial hair.

Nose: Average length nose, puffs out into a real schnoz halfway down the bridge. Nostrils kinda flair upwards. Makes my eyes and lips look smaller than they are.

Ears: Tops of my ears are at eyebrow height. Lobes reach to just about my lips. Mostly held back against my head. Unattached earlobes.

Hair color: Black.

Hair style: Used to be an undercut swept to my right. I let the top grow out, and kept the sides and back shaved very close. Now it just falls against the right side of my face in a mussy fluff, reaching down to just under eye level. Hair has a natural wave-mess to it.

Facial hair. Goatee and cheek fuzz, all the same color as my hair, connects to my sideburns. Not thin lines of facial hair. Thick enough to make a solid circle on my chin and mouth.

He looked about 23 (he was actually 19)

The top of his head was square with a pointy, cleft chin. His face was much like a house-shaped Pentagon.

He had football shaped eyes, thick eyelashes, and deep bags. His eyes seemed to be glossy and bloodshot.

His Eye Brows are thick and shaped like a rectangle attacked to an obtuse triangle.

His lips were torn up like he'd been chewing em, but otherwise fairly average. They were just a little wider than his nose, and his lower lip was thicker than his upper.

His nose was fairly normal, but it bent inwards towards his eyebrow and looked almost like it wasn't even connected to the rest of him. His nostrils bulged out.\

His ears were right along his eye line. They stuck out maybe 1 inch, but the top half was in his hair. Lobes were unattached.

His hair was dark. Not quite black, but close, almost like tree bark.

His hair was combed over on one side, almost like a subtler combover style, but with less spike. It was all short and the sideburns were just starting to grow back.

He had the tiniest beginnings of a moustache. He must have shaved recently.

Hair color: dark roots with a gradual change into dirty blonde then into blonde

Ethnicity: Caucasian (Central/Eastern European)

Head Shape/Jaw: Oval head with high forehead, mid cheekbones, low rounding jawline 

Eyes: Roundish-almond eyes, medium length eyelashes, slight wider distance from eye to eye.  Inner eyes nearly lined up with the eyebrows. Soft-rounded rectangle glasses.  Upper eyelid is not easily present as the eyes are slightly hooded.

Eye colour: brownish - can look almost light coffee colored in daylight.

Eye brows: Medium thickness and trimmed in the middle as to not have a unibrow.  Slightly swooping up as they go away from the nose in even thickness until downturning and tapering at the end. The eye brows end at the point where the line of the lower eye curves upwards about a finger's width away.

Chin: Rounded and does not jut out too far. Distance chin to mouth is about the same as distance nose to mouth.

Mouth: Wider than nose, thicker lower lip than upper lip.  Ends of mouth line up with the outer edge of the pupils. 

Nose: Strong European nose, nosetip is rounded but does not curve down, nostrils are almost ovalish and blend in upwards in a waterdrop shape due to the nosetip definition, nose is straight and tapers very slightly as it reaches the eyes. About a finger's width down from the bridge of the glasses there is a slight bump that is not very noticeable when looking straight but is present when facing sideways.

Ears: Goes from bottom of eyebrow to the top of the nostrils. Detached earlobes with single piercing in each lobe. Visible but not protruding too far out and away from the head. Slight pointed tip at the top as it turns downwards and is rounded in the middle, lobe form nearly a straight line as no part sticks out too far from each other, and ends as it attaches back to the head in a wide rounded lobe with shallow inner ear shelf (I hope that makes sense!).

Hair: Dark brown with some strands of silver hair but has been dyed to burgundy.

Hairstyle: Long straight hair with no bangs and no layering. Hair does have a tendency to hold a little bit of a wave when the hair was pulled into a ponytail or in a bun for long periods of time.

Other Characteristics: Very small amount of freckling under each eye contained around the eye socket area and is visible close up with bright light.

Facial Hair: None!

Skin Tone: Fair to pale with some pinkish tones along the cheeks.  Mild sunburn due to the paleness but afterwards start to have a consistent and long lasting tan the color of graham crackers.",2015-09-13 18:22:33

**Brows:** The brows are well-kept and very arched/sculpted. They're reasonably thick and dark but not overly so. The tails extend more outward than directly down. Ash brown in colour.

**Forehead + Hairline:** The forehead is a fairly average size with a hairline lacking a widows peak.

Eyes: They're a wide (up and down) almond shape and ever so slightly farther apart than my eyes are long (left to right). They have a minor tilt downwards. I have long, dark eyelashes.

Eye Color: Green like matcha tea

Eye Brows: Mostly straight until they are even with the outside edges of my eye, then they curve down and get thinner.

Chin: My chin is unremarkable. Not small or big, neither well-defined or weak.

Mouth: My lower lip is wider than my top lip, but not by much. My cupid's bow is very defined, but it is more angular than curved, like my upper lip is a wide capital M. When I smile, my gums and upper teeth and only a hint of my lower teeth show, and I have a dimple on my left cheek.

Nose: Average sized and very smooth. The widest part of my nose is probably about the same width as my eyes, and it extends past the inner corners of my eyes. Looking at me straight on, you can see my nostrils, but at an angle. My philtrum (that defined bump underneath your nose and above your lips) is relatively well-defined.

Ears: Go about from bottom of my eye to the space between my nose and mouth.

Hair Color: Dark brown

Hair Style: Curls for days! It is thick and wild enough to be given its own name by my friends, and the curls have a mind of their own. They span from the diameter of a roll of nickels to a roll of quarters, and sometimes the curls change direction halfway down the strand. The curls around my face are usually the most perfect spirals, and the curls behind my ears are the thickest ringlets. My hair is clavicle-length but layered, with shorter face-framing pieces, and I usually part it a couple of inches left of center. It is frizzy.

\*\*Gender:\*\* Female

\*\*Head shape/jaw:\*\* Oval face shape. Jaw is not particularly prominent, and I think my cheeks are the widest part of my face, especially when I smile.  

\*\*Eyes:\*\* Roundish, I think very slightly upturned? Hooded eyelids.  

\*\*Eye color:\*\* Grey  

\*\*Eyebrows:\*\* Thin and a bit sparse. Not to the point of looking patchy or anything, but no one on earth would describe my eyebrows as ""bushy"" or ""full"". :P

\*\*Chin:\*\* Small, definitely not prominent or pointy.  

\*\*Mouth:\*\* Top lip is quite thin, slightly fuller bottom lip. Small mouth overall.  

\*\*Nose:\*\* Buttonish, a bit upturned, round tip with no center indent (I hope that makes sense? It's just round and smooth). Bridge has a teeny little bump about halfway down, but it's hardly noticeable even in profile.   

\*\*Ears:\*\* Small and mostly flat to my head.  

\*\*Hair color:\*\* I'm a ginger. Yep. 

\*\*Hair style:\*\* Full undercut. The top is layered; the longest pieces fall just under my chin. I usually wear it all pushed over to the right side, quite messy.  

\*\*Facial hair:\*\* N/A  

\*\*Skin tone:\*\* PALE. 

\*\*Piercings:\*\* Septum, earlobes 

\*\*Tattoos:\*\* Yes, but not on my face or neck, so kind of irrelevant? 

\*\*Miscellaneous:\*\* N/A

Oooof. That was actually difficult?! I can't recall ever having to describe my face in detail, before. If anything is unclear, or just not enough info, let me know!

The Name's Israel, I'm an aspiring actor with a rather strange face in my opinion. Let's hammer it out.

Gender: Male

Face Shape: I have a longish head, average prominence on jaw and a bit of a pointy chin. It just BARELY has a cleft in it. My face is generally thin across, I think.

Eyes/Brow: Both are set rather high on my face (and then the rest falls bellow it evenly). My brow bone is prominent, but high set and not very sharp edged. My eyebrows are feathery. Thin, Dark, and feathery. My eyes are blue and one eye width apart. They're rather large and almond shaped, tilted ever so slightly, higher in the middle and lower on the outer edge. They're also rather sunken, there's usually a bit of a line under them, and I keep them lidded a bit perpetually, so people tend to think I look tired or high (though I've never smoked marijuana).

Chin: A bit prominent, like I said. About 1.2 eye widths wide and like an inch and a 5/8 away from my mouth.

Mouth: Average size (a little wider than my nose or chin). Fairly full lips, bottom lip a bit more than the top. The bottom lip stays pretty full till the edge, the top lip gradually thins away. The dip in my top lip is small and a little round, and either side of the top is also rounded off, not sharp.

Nose: Fairly prominent, not too wide along bridge, but wider at the bottom, a bit of a septum on me. the base of my noes is shaped kind of like a wide diamond. The tip of my nose pokes out, doesn't round off. The bridge of my nose is a little longer.

Ears: They go from the base of my nose to my eyes.

Hair Color: Brown

Hair Style: Short on the sides, long on top. Bangs hanging to the left.

I hope I didn't forget anything... Thanks!",2015-09-09 04:02:21

My name is Alyx, and I will be as descriptive as I can for you. Best of luck!

Gender: Female

Head Shape/Jaw: Pretty standard oval-shaped face. My cheekbones are present, but not especially sharp, and transition smoothly into my jaw. My jaw itself is a touch rounded at the sides.

Eyes: Almond-shaped, and a bit small for my face. The skin around my eyes is puffy as opposed to sunken into the sockets, which gives my eyes a slightly hooded look (though I myself am not of Asian descent). My right eye is a bit puffier, due to a birthmark, so it almost looks like I have a black eye. I have dark lashes.

Eye Color: Hazel, bordering on green.

Eye Brows: HAHA. Right. So they're kind of uneven, thanks to a tweezing mishap when I was younger. My left eyebrow is fine - the correct length and placement, if not slightly thin toward the end. It arcs toward the outside edge of my eye, and if anything, it's a little angular. My right eyebrow - this being above the puffier eye - doesn't have that smooth arc, and kind of cuts upward in a jagged line instead of arcing smoothly. Hopefully you can make sense of that.

Chin: Averagely-sized for my face, no dimple. Perhaps a bit small, but not by much.

Mouth: Once again, averagely sized and placed for my face. My lips are light pink, not especially full, and when I smile open-mouthed I tend to actually frown a bit (read: I'm trying to suppress that smile but godDAMN something funny just happened) so my upper lip stretches thin and curves down at the corners. That makes it sound really unattractive but it's not entirely, I don't think. My teeth are even and square, except my canines, which are angular and stick a little lower than the rest.

Nose: Think button nose, just not up-turned at the end. My nostrils aren't defined at all. The bridge of my nose does get thinner, but just enough to balance things out. 

Ears: Are usually covered by my hair. They are small and keep close to my head.

Hair Color: Dark Brown.

Hair Style: I part my hair on the left, with bangs that sweep to the right and are cut just at the eyebrow before tapering down the length of my face (kind of choppily). I have fringe on the other side as well. My bangs are wavy, and my hair itself does a lot of things, but for the sake of the sketch we'll say it has loose curls. Average consistency. It ends right about at my clavicles, thinning out toward the ends.

Facial Hair: None, thank god.

I'll also note that my complexion is pale with freckles, mostly over my cheeks. My cheeks do get a little rosy, as does the tip of my nose and my chin.

Thanks for taking a look, and if I can tempt **/u/peopleintheirsocks** especially, that would be really special. For both us, I promise - you'll see. But anyone who is interested in trying their hand, please do! I'd really appreciate it.

EDIT: I suppose I should add my general understanding of how I look, hm? So overall, I think my features are kind of on the delicate side. No one feature of my face is overbearing on the others, though I've always been self-conscious about my eye. If you look at how my face is structured, it follows an average Polish female (I say this based on photos I've seen that compare dozens of ethnicities to one another) though I don't know if that helps you much. I think from front-on my cheekbones might be more prominent that I let myself believe, as well.",2015-09-08 21:33:51

Gender: female, 19 years old. 

Head Shape/Jaw: head shape is pretty oval but sligtly more squared at the top. Jaw is ever so slightly squared, with no real definition to my chin, though it does come to a slight point. 

Eyes: I have fairly large eyes, kind of almond shaped, green, always pretty wise open. Usually my entire iris is visible. This also means that my eyebrows look pretty sassy most of the time. Average spacing, as far apart as the eye is wide.

Eye Color: very green.

Eye Brows: sassy. Left arch is pointier naturally, though they're both fairly strongly arched. If you drew lines up along the side of my nose and the corners of my eyes, that's where they start and end. 

Chin: soft rounded point. No real definition between the rest of my jaw and my chin. Faint shadow between bottom of my lip and top of chin

Mouth:fairly strong cupids bow, edges curve up slightly past where my actual lips are. Both top and bottom are fairly full, though the top is slightly less so than the bottom. The fleshy part of my lips is about as wide as my nose. Sometimes I look kind of like a geisha in that respect. 

Nose: fairly straight though I firmly believe,it really is slightly turned to the left. It's been previously described as a button nose, whatever that means. No real point to it. Best described as a kind of rounded square shape. Turned up. Only real angle to it is visible from the side. Rounded nostrils, slightly wider than my eyes are apart.  About a fingers width above my lips

Ears: only the tops are visible from the side, and the tops are pretty level with my eyes

Hair Color: rainbows?

Gender: Female  
Head Shape/Jaw: Head shape is oval. Jaws are pretty straight, but not harsh. People keep describing my face as pleasant.  
Eyes: Pretty standard, open eyes. Not huge and chidlike/insane, but no squint. They're not deep set but enough that there's some line-age below them, coming from the nose (Internet says bunny lines?). Eyelashes are sandy but naturally longish and curled. A little lid is visible.  
Eye Colour: Medium blue. Some say they have gray mixed in, some say they have green mixed in.  
Eye Brows: Unadulterated, standard eyebrows. Sandy coloured. Right curves a slight more than left.  
Chin: Small, round, cleftless. If I was much heavier I'd have another half chin.  
Mouth: Small, a smidge more wide than my nose. I used to describe my lips as thin but either with age or self confidence they are now pretty standard sized, upper lip being thinner than the lower lip. My upper lip sort of ends on my right side before the edge of the mouth. Slight ""mouth frown"" lines, as the Internet apparently calls them.  
Nose: Average nose length, slightly upturned nose tip. Uninteresting nostrils. Faint nasolabial lines. A tiny round acne scar between my right nostril and my right nasolabial line.  
Ears: Not prominent; attached and undefined earlobes. One piercing in each lobe, each with a small gold hoop, although hair tends to cover the ears. My right ear is rounded and is more forward facing, and my left ear lies more flat against my head and is more pointed than my right (definitely not elven).  
Hair Colour: Naturally red. Not gingery, not strawberry-y, not carrot-y, not auburn. I suppose a natural orangeish/copper colour. Its hard to describe. Currently there are 4 bleached streaks that peek out, two on each side, not symmetrical.  
Hair Style: A couple inches longer than shoulder length. Artificially curled, but brushed out. A few pieces at the front are more defined. Right part, above the centre of my right eye. A swooping straight bang/fringe goes from my part to the outside of my left eyebrow. My hair is quite thick and big, about as wide as my generous shoulders.

Age: Seventeen.

Face shape:  Thin, narrow, square-ish.  Somewhat pronounced cheekbones, sloping down into a small, square jaw.

Eyes:  Brown, very round.  Long eyelashes.  Well-proportioned eyebrows.

Hair:  Also brown.  I'm kinda vain about it - it's parted from the left side, combed into what was once a traditional, clean-cut 1950s style, but has grown shaggier in time.  At the length I've let it grow to, it is very thick, covers my ears, and there is a large waved cowlick on the side of my head.  A thick, overgrown version of a businessman combover.  I also have a widow's peak.

Nose:  On the narrower side, but not too much.  The ball of it is rounded, and my nostrils are rather large.

Mouth:  Full lips, I guess.  The bottom one a bit more so than the top.

Skin complexion:  I recently caught a tan, but I'm generally pale and have a bit of an acne problem.  

Other:  I am unusually thin, so keep that in mind as it relates to my face.  I have something of a chicken neck.  I can't grow a significant amount of facial hair yet, but I get a bit of pedo-stubble on my upper lip and around the edge of my chin.  A few hairs on my cheeks, too.  From an average, conversational distance, though, I appear clean-shaven.

I hope someone can get around to me; I am very curious of the results.  Thank you for your time.

**Head shape/jaw:** have a skinny face that’s a pretty average length. 
High, prominent cheek bones and a natural contour on the sides of my face (I’m pretty thin) but when I smile my cheeks look sorta chubby 
The bottom half of my face is square (NOT boxy, just very clear corners lol) I have a sharp jawline and jaw to chin is a steep line but not a long face (jaw bone is probably at 135° angle) 

**Eyes:** My eyes are I guess almond shaped?? They’re pretty big but not like bugging out. The crease of my eyelid is exactly halfway in between my eyelash line and my eyebrows. 

**Eye color:** blue but not like WOW SO BLUE

**Eyebrows:** My eyes brows are sorta high, a little less than an inch above my lash line when my eyes are open, and they are a normal thickness, light brown, a slight rounded arch and the inner parts are square, not rounded

**Chin:** slight butt chin, definitely not pointy, it’s about an inch of flatness.

**Mouth:** same distance from my chin as they are from my nose..... think of the most average size and shape lips you can think of. 

**Nose:** My nose is very average, round, a slight droop (usually only noticeable from the side) when I smile. Thin. it’s about 2.25-2.5 inches long from the start of my eyebrows.

**Ears:** you can basically see my whole ear if you are looking at me from the front and my hair is up, but I don’t have monkey ears, they just stick out a little. Connected lobes

**Hair color:** medium brown on top, fades to a light brown, almost blonde

**Hair style:** long, pin straight, and I have bangs that are straight down and cover my eyebrows and eyelids but not completely because my hair isn’t that thick. 

**Facial hair:** none

**Skin tone:** white and pretty pale but not the palest person you have ever seen. Cheeks get a little red sometimes

**Piercings:** none

**Tattoos:** none

**Miscellaneous:** I wear round glasses (but not circles, almost half circles and the top is slightly rounded)and the frame is clear, tinted dark green.

I've been kind of sad lately so I thought that this might cheer me up :) I'm definitely going to recommend my friends this sub, too.
**Gender:** Woman
**Head shape/jaw:** Oval shaped with a slight overbite
**Eyes:** I have deep set eyes, and my creases are prominent because of this. My eyes are otherwise almond shaped. I also have very prominent undereye circles that don't go away so I learned to embrace them. I think they make my eyes look bigger too.
**Eye color:** Grey-blue
**Eyebrows:** My eyebrows have a very slight arch but are mostly straight. I don't pluck them but they aren't extremely thick either.
**Chin:** My face is mostly oval shaped but my chin does have a slight bump.
**Mouth:** My mom always said I had a pouty mouth. It's not very wide, but my lips are kind of full. My top lip is fuller, I have a prominent cupid's bow. I usually don't smile showing my teeth due to years of braces.
**Nose:** My nose is long and thin, though it's widest at the tip. My nostrils aren't particularly prominent. When I google ""nose shapes"", it's closest to a Roman or Aquiline nose, though it has no bumps on the bridge or anything. From the side it kind of just reminds me of a right triangle.
**Ears:** My ears are small and don't stick forward or anything.
**Hair color:** Light brown
**Hair style:** My hair is wavy and naturally messy. It doesn't look neat no matter how much I brush it (again, so I learned to embrace it). I usually part it slightly to the side. It's about chest length. It's also on the thin side despite being messy.
**Facial hair:** none
**Skin tone:** I'm pretty pale but with gold undertones rather than pink ones.
**Piercings:** Just ears
**Tattoos:** n/a

**Head shape/jaw:** Squarish-oval. It is longer than it is wide but only by a little bit. I have a smaller forehead and a larger, angular jaw. Prominent cheekbones.

**Eyes:**  Medium sized eyes described as lion-like eyes. Upturned, wideset, almond shaped eyes. Double eyelids but one double eyelid is larger than the other. A little hooded.

**Eye color:** Black/Brown

**Eyebrows:** Longer than my eyes, but only by a bit. Tail starts sloping downwards around 3/4 into my eyes. Full, medium to thin in width.

**Chin:** Starts going pretty pointed and then rounds out at the very bottom. This is what makes my face slightly oval.

**Mouth:** Small. Upturned when resting. Asymmetric, but even if I didn't have cleft lip would be described as not super full. The middle makes a point. Looks a little bit like a cartoon cat. Length of mouth is about the same as width of nose.

**Nose:** Medium sized, bulbous, rounded, one-side tilts down because of cleft. Not a lot of nosebridge.

**Ears:** Small-medium sized. Pretty average shape.

**Hair color:**  Dark brown

**Hair style:** Long, past my shoulders, straight. Worn with a headband.

**Facial hair:** 

**Skin tone:** Yellow

**Piercings:** 

**Tattoos:** 

**Miscellaneous:**  I have a not very prominant scar running from my mouth to my nose almost halfway into my mouth. Also helps in making my mouth look a little like a cartoon cat. People often say I look young and have pretty full cheeks. I like to look girly. I'm 5'7 and about ~120lbs, slim.

\*\*Chin:\*\*  Um, a standard chin. No cleft, much like my jaw its not overly chiseled nor is it featureless. It is round most of the way through though, with little plateauing or flattening out.

\*\*Mouth:\*\*   Its about 3 cm up from the bottom of my chin and about 1 cm down from my nose.

The edges of my lips pretty much line up with the edges of my chin, if not slightly past.

Eyelashes are almost nonexistant. Low eyelids, with general wrinkliness to them. Eyes slightly slanted to the center, kind of Keanu-like, even though the rest of the face is totally different.

**Eyebrows:**    Just above the eye gap. Dark brown or grey, really bushy. Very different type of hair from my head hair. Pretty thick, not a thin line. Pretty close to each other, get much closer than the eyes do. Stops at around nose level on both sides. 

**Chin:**  Rounded, total cleft. 

**Mouth:** Very small upper lip, big lower lip. Pink. Minor whitish border with the rest of the face. 

**Nose:**  Big. Beaklike, points downward, so nostrils aren't visible from looking at me straight on. Rounded end of the nose, like a ball, somewhat. Generally smooth all around. 

**Ears:** Really big, long lobes. Covered entirely by hair. Part of the reason my hair is this long. More of a hair detail, but I could be wearing cable headphones and you wouldn't be able to tell. 

**Hair color:** Dirty blond. 

**Hair style:**  Really long, down to my clavicle. Not totally curly but pretty curved. Very thin individual hairs, but just a lot of them. Hangs downward, doesn't extend upward much at all. Frames my face, covers ears and part of my face. Pretty wide, general shape of the whole mass is kind of a helmet around my face. Partition right above my left eye. Both sides are roughly equally long. If I really wanted to, I could easily push it from the sides to the front and have it cover my entire face like Cousin Itt. 

**Facial hair:** None. 

**Skin tone:**  Pinkish-yellow. Super pale. Spanish, so I guess I count as Caucasian? 

**Piercings:** None 

**Tattoos:** None 

**Miscellaneous:** Spot under the right nostril.

Gender: male

Head shape/jaw: Sort of an average oval if not ever-so-slightly elongated in height. Maybe 4-5 inches in width at the center point. My forehead is rather large, taking up just about the entire upper half of my head.

Eyes: Regular size and shape, maybe like a perfect football. My eyelids are pretty thin and don’t cover much of my eyeball. They are slightly more far apart from each other than average. Not really any bags under my eyes. They also don’t look sunken in to my skull too much. I have fairly long eyelashes for a guy, that are longer on the outside and shorter on the inside, like a fairy or something.

Eye color: Dark blue, and pretty washed out. Almost gray-ish.

Eyebrows: Also pretty regular in shape. They just about follow the curve of my eye and the outer corners run maybe a quarter inch farther than the corner of my eye. Fairly thin and sharp.

Chin: My chin keeps with the oval-shaped curve of my face. It doesn’t really flatten out at all.

Mouth: Mouth seems regular. Subtly heart-shaped upper lip, a little in the thin side. My bottom lip is a bit thicker than my upper lip and has a good curve to it.

Nose: The distance between the bottom of my chin, my lips, and my nose are almost equal. My nose is maybe a little closer to my mouth than my chin is. Anyway, nose is a little bigger than average I think. Not a huge schnauz, though. Way upturned, probably at an exact 45 degree angle. I have long nostril holes that you could see if you were looking at me from the front.

Ears: Regular as heck. Almost flat to my head if you were looking at me from the front. The top of my ear starts at the same height as my eyes and ends at the bottom of my nose.

Hair color: Dirty blonde with a hint of red that probably won’t come across in the picture.

Hair style: A comb-over but the sides of my head aren’t shaved. Hair is maybe an inch and a half to 2 inches long. I would say it’s a “proper” or “formal” look.

Facial hair: Pathetic

Skin tone: White, definitely on the pale side.

Piercings: No

Tattoos: Not on my face

Miscellaneous: I have prescription glasses. Hipster style, you know the ones. Those ones teenagers wear but they take the lenses out.",2019-10-10 23:51:22
"[request] 14-18F, I love the idea of this sub and wonder what y'all can come up with!",3,dfu3f4,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliceSketchme/comments/dfu3f4/request_1418f_i_love_the_idea_of_this_sub_and/,0,1570718564.0,"Hey all, it's me, u/ThisAcc0untEmptyYeet! I don't reveal my true age, but I'm between fourteen and eighteen. Most people say I look seventeen. I saw this sub and knew I had to post -- I always enjoyed speculating on what someone looks like just based on how they describe themselves, so I figured I'd try being the mystery girl for once!

\*\*Gender:\*\* Female

\*\*Head shape/jaw:\*\* Face shape is a hybrid between oval and square. My face is a little on the shorter side, slightly angular jawline. The widest part of my face is at the cheekbones. My forehead isn't too big or small, just average, I guess.

\*\*Eyes:\*\* I used [this WikiHow](https://www.wikihow.com/Determine-Eye-Shape) to determine my eye shape, since I've never really thought about it before. Apparently I have downturned, almond eyes that are set a little wide and deep. I have been described as having a ""wolfish"" look due to my deeper set eyes.

\*\*Eye color:\*\* Amber.

\*\*Eyebrows:\*\* Straight with barely any arch, thick but with medium fullness and a light color. Long, a little unkempt (I don't shape them in any way because they're light colored enough that I can get away with a little bit of straying.)

\*\*Chin:\*\* Average, neither strong nor weak.

\*\*Mouth:\*\* I have thin, but well defined lips (not pouty at all). Smile is very slightly asymmetrical, just enough that when I smile with my mouth a little open, you can glimpse my teeth on the right side of my face only. Also, all of my upper teeth from the canines back are oddly pointed -- I mention it because it's something a lot of people notice about me, and if someone were to describe me for a police sketch they'd probably include it.

\*\*Nose:\*\* I've always thought it was a little big. It's similar to a Roman nose, but protrudes forward less and has a lower bridge than most of the ones you see if you google ""Roman nose."" It has thar slight angle in the bridge, but ends flat, not hooked.

\*\*Ears:\*\* Unsure. Normal, I guess? Never thought about it.

\*\*Hair color:\*\* Golden/blonde.

\*\*Hair style:\*\* I don't really have a style, just a typical cut that extends slightly past my armpits when let down. I have type 2A wavy hair (yes, I got bored and did a quiz to determine my hair type). I don't have bangs.

\*\*Facial hair:\*\* None.

\*\*Skin tone:\*\* White, but not super pale -- I tan and don't burn easily. My ancestry is 1/4 Russian, 1/2 Romanian and 1/4 Greek, if that helps visualize my skin color at all.

\*\*Piercings:\*\* None.

\*\*Tattoos:\*\* None.

\*\*Miscellaneous:\*\* One small facial scar, looks like a faint line running down my nose. Starts a couple millimeters under the bridge and extends down about a centimeter.

I'll post photos for comparison after I get a few sketches \^\^ good luck!

Edit: Info about my build, don't know if this is helpful but I thought maybe it might be. I'm an athlete, extremely low body fat percentage but I'm muscular (not super skinny). I'm 5'5"".",2019-10-10 22:42:44

&#x200B;

**Gender:** Male

**Height/build:** 5'8"", generally athletic build.

**Head shape/jaw:** Head is medium, generally ovalular? If thats a word? Its pretty oval-shaped. Jawline from the front goes to my chin at about a 45 degree angle.

**Eyes:** My eye shape is pretty standard, but very relaxed, I have pretty standard length, darker eyelashes.

**Eye color:** Hazel, but they tend to swap from Hazel to Green seemingly at will so choose either color.

**Eyebrows:** Dark brown. Full, decently flat, the centimeter of my right eyebrow the hair goes straight up instead of following the rest of the brow. Not close to a unibrow though

**Chin:** Pretty standard chin, pretty flat and finishes off the jawline smoothly.

**Mouth:** Pretty standard-- the corners roughly match up with my pupils-- my lower lip is decently larger than my upper lip but nothing that would make you look twice at it. The shape tends to stay generally flat. Upper lip is shaped quite like a relaxed version of one of those seagulls you drew in grade 1.

**Nose:** Normal width, slightly larger protrusion wise. All in all a normal nose

**Ears:** Literally the most average looking ears. Pretty flat against my head, about the same height as my nose.

**Hair color:** Dirty Blond.

**Hair style:** Medium length and curly. The top is curly while the sides are shaved short enough that it isn't an afro but not to the point that they aren't there. One curl loosely hangs down above my left eye.

**Facial hair:** Very faint, typical high school facial hair.

**Skin tone:** White

**Piercings:** None

**Tattoos:** None

**Scars:** None

**Miscellaneous:** Told I look my age, also told I do look high quite often because of the relaxed eyes. Decently sized bags under my eyes as well

Gender: Female

Height/build: 5’7, pear-shaped, most of weight is in lower half of body

Head shape/jaw: Head is medium size, oval shaped, slightly chubby cheeks, slightly angular jaw, medium-thin chin

Eyes: Very large eyes, rounded almond shape, long dark eyelashes

Eye color: Hazel, mostly light olive with some amber around the pupil

Eyebrows: Dark brown, pretty full and thick, but manicured (I wax my eyebrows) I have a slight unibrow if I don’t fix them up, but I always do

Chin: rounded, small/medium sized, nothing too interesting

Mouth: big lower lip, medium/big upper lip. Round shape together with an angular Cupid’s bow. My mouth opening extends slightly past my lips on each side 

Nose: Standard shape, straight, average size, no turns

Gender: Female

Height/build: 5’5”, rather thin and skinny.

Head shape/jaw: My head is rather round, almost circular up until my jaw, where my face slopes downward. There are two darker freckles stacked on top of each other on the right side of my jaw. 

Eyes: My eyes are quite large, and only the the very top of my iris is covered by my eyelid. My eyelashes are quite long and curled. The very edge of them do slope downwards. My right eye is slightly hooded (the skin only covers the outermost crease). Other than that, my eyes are rather wide. 

Eye color: Steely blue, with dark blue ringing them. Very little traces of gold or amber can be seen. 

Eyebrows: Dark brown, and they are shaped. Medium thickness, but not unruly. There is a moderate arch in them, but the left one is more arched. 

Chin:  Curves slightly outward from where the rest of my jaw is, and like the rest of my face, it is quite round. There is two dark freckles on the left side. It sticks out slightly, but not enough to be severe. 

Mouth: My lips are quite thin, and the corners slope downwards. The bottom lip is slightly more prominent than the top (not by much) and there is a noticeable arch on the top where my Cupid’s bow is. My Cupid’s bow is average, but slightly on the shorter side. 

Nose: My nose is very round, but it narrows out once it reaches the bridge. It protrudes out a little bit, and the end points upwards. It hits just below the centre of my face. There are some rather light freckles across my nose. 

Ears: Rather average, a little on the small side and the tip is round, but it’s more pointed than most. They are pierced. 

Hair color: Medium brown, but it’s lighter at the front. When the light hits it, it goes very coppery.

Hair style: When loose, my hair hits just below the shoulder blades. Usually, it’s loose or tied up into a high ponytail. I have a side parting, with a short fringe/bangs that is present on the right side of my face. It ends just above my eyebrow, but it does trail to the end of my eyebrow. 

Facial hair: None. 

Skin tone: Incredibly pale and pasty. 

Piercings: One on each ear lobe. 

Tattoos: None

Miscellaneous: Like most teens, there is the odd spot, but none are red and inflamed - they’re very unnoticeable unless you go incredibly close to my face.  Usually wear makeup, but day-to-day, smudged kohl liner on my bottom lash line and mascara is the only noticeable bits.

"[Request] 29 y/o Female, Told I Look Young, Messy Hair, Basic Makeup, Chimpunk Cheeks",3,dfdrqk,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliceSketchme/comments/dfdrqk/request_29_yo_female_told_i_look_young_messy_hair/,7,1570635756.0,"Saw this and thought it was interesting. I've recently got into makeup so been learning about my different shapes of my faces so let's see if I'm okay at explaining. Lol.

 **Gender:** Female.

**Head shape/jaw:** So I've actually recently asked this question and the answer I got was heart shaped. Tho I dont thinkin it's exactly heart shaped. My jaw is only slightly thinner than my cheeks. When I smile I have hamster cheeks if that helps.

**Eyes:** My best guess from tryna learn make up is down turned almond eyes. Eyes are exactly one eye length spaced apart if that helps.

**Eye color:** Brown.

**Eyebrows:** Curved, dark brown I think.

**Chin:** I've got a butt chin. The dimple in the middle isnt too prominent, but it is what it is.

**Mouth:** So naturally my lips are turned downward. The top one is a little thinner than bottom, but not too much. And the philtrum (word I just learned in research on my face) is v-shaped. The corners of my mouth are parallel with my iris and the pointy part of my philtrum lines with my nostrils if that makes sense. Lips pink colored.

**Nose:** Its been described as Owen Wilson like. And while I'd say that's an exaggeration it does have a slight crook in the same place his does. Tho I'd say my nose is fuller and doesnt turn down as dramatically as his.

**Ears:** I'm not sure. I'd say crescent or reverse triangle based on googling. If I wear my hair up or behind my ear you can see some of my ear. The length is about from my fingertip to between the end of my nail and beginning of knuckle. Tho I usually wear my hair down and over my ears.

**Hair color:** You choose! But no seriously my hair has been every color, blonde, brunette, red, multi colored, everything but black. I'm not even sure my natural hair color anymore. But currently it's like a reddish brown.

**Hair style:** Little bit below shoulder length and wavy. Goes to the top of my cleavage. Usually parted in the middle. Widows peak.

**Facial hair:** None

**Skin tone:** I'm considered light neutral in concealer if that helps.

**Piercings:** Just ears, but I never wear earrings.

**Tattoos:** Not on my face.

**Miscellaneous:** I tend to wear makeup. Either super dark colored lips (berry, blue-reds, purbles) or nudes (light browns, grayish purple, non peach pinks). Usually wear eyeliner on the water line, a little on top, and winged tip lately. Plus mascara. Most of my comparison photos will have this, but I'll try to take a regular one too.

Leaving the part for comparison picture when I get an answer of how long to wait til posting it.

Gender: Male

Age: 23

Ethnicity: Mostly Russian (some Polish) Ashkenazi Jew

Head Shape/Jaw: High positioned and noticeable slavic check bones. not too prominent or dominant. Because of this there is a slight incline inward before the head becomes rounded at the top. Wide jaw. From the top of the check bones down to where the jawline starts the outline is slightly rounded and not straight. Jawline is also curved. 

Eyes: Thin Almond Eyes. Not to close and not to far apart.

Eye Color: Brown. With good lighting dark hazel. 

Chin: On an even plane with my nose. Round and big but inline with the jaw line and no protruding. Roundness of chin is noticeable by the top of it (by the lip)

Mouth: A little wider than my nose when not smiling. Think very red lips both on the top and bottom. With the top tapering off and thinning out on the edges. The ridges between me nose and my upper lip are highish and my upper lip has a triangle in the middle.

Nose: Medium sized jew nose. No stereotypical bump on the ridge though. Ridge slopes slightly curved down to eyes with the dip not being too big. half an inch above lip (well the first segment of my index finger anyways). Bulbous at the tip. Right nostril is higher than the left. Can see partially into nostrils. Wide nostrils that line up with the about distance between the eyes. Cartilage at the bottom center is the lowest point of the nose (lower than nostrils).

Ears: Obama like in terms of protrusion from head. The inner cartilage are tucked into the large bowl of the large ears. Very large lobes (and that will only grow with age) that are attached but round up near where they attach. Flat on the outside edge. Very round top. Pointed back.

Hair color: Brown with red highlights in the sun.

Hair Style: Short and messy. Thinning at the top but not receding ;_; Very little side beards when shaven. 

Facial Hair: Ungroomed short beard that starts to get dark red when starts to get longer. Natural small soul patch with no hair around it. Line of Mustache continues natural and visible down with a line. Not too thick of a beard and it is not very high or neck based.  Now I shave regularly.

Also minor zit scarring on checks (damn puberty).

Head Shape/Jaw: This is hard. I guess I have a heart shaped head, if I had to guess? Or maybe more oval? I have high cheekbones.

Eyes: I've been told I have big eyes. I probably have roundish-almond eyes. I think my eyes are about an eye-length apart.
 
Eye Color: Hazel eyes- they look green in the light, but light brown in the dark. The inside (around the pupil) is green, and the outside is brown.

Eye Brows: I have dark eyebrows, not especially thick, not especially thin. They're set horizontally on my face, with a slight arch to them. Thinner towards the ends, I think.

Chin: A nice little chin, I guess. Not pointy, rounded.
 
mouth: Wider than my nose. Both lips are thick, but not too thick. Bottom lip is a little thicker, but only a little.

nose: I think I have a wide nose. Not long, but wide. I have big nostrils, but they don't flare out or anything. Kinda roundish in the middle. I have a deviated septum (?), so the little bridge in between my nostrils is a little crooked. It deviates to the right when I look at myself in the mirror. 

Ears: Honestly, you wouldn't notice the ears under my hair anyways ;p 

Hair color-Dark brown

Hair style-I have really curly hair. But it's thin, and doesn't have too much volume. If I stop pushing it up, it looks a bit flat against my head. Also, I part it on the left side, where most of the hair is brushed to the right. It reaches right below my shoulders. 

Hope that was clear enough! I've never thought about how to describe my features, so it was a little hard. Please let me know if I need to expand on anything! And thanks for drawing me if anybody does :)",2015-09-07 11:55:19

each other perfectly.

Chin: Sticks out, but just a **little** bit. Only enough so you can see a kind of line, like the top half of an oval... 
Not sure if that makes sense.

Mouth: A little wider than my nose is. Thick lower lip. Thick upper lip in middle. Frenulum is fairly deep, not very 
wide. Very full, defined lips. Measure probably less than inch across my face.

Nose: Average length nose. About half inch above my upper lip. Nose tip is up turned, as to see inside nostrils a 
little bit... just a little. Small, egg shaped nostrils. 

Ears: Unattached lobes. Not round, not pointy either. Can sort of see ear if I was looking directly at you.

Forehead: Normal. Average hairline, very straight. 

Hair Color: Dirty blonde.

* ~~Work on the rules/sidebar. This is first on my to-do list. Yes, this place is kind of a mess. The subreddit went live out of nowhere yesterday (thanks, other mods) and I scrambled to set things up. Hopefully I can get that sorted out today.~~ **Done**

* Setup AutoModerator to warn user they didn't use a tag in their post title (and if possible, detect which flair is needed and assign it). I want to do this in such a way it doesn't get annoying, but gets everybody's attention. 

* ~~This one is kind of a hot topic among all of you: Posting your actual photo. I 100% agree with you that you should have to post a follow-up photo, but I'm not really sure how we could enforce this.~~ **Done. Not sure how we can enforce this yet, though.**

Eyes: Almost round but turned upward slightly. Sort of halfway between a double eyelid and mono-lid. (I often have people ask if I'm Asian, I'm not.)

Eye Color: Blue

Eyebrows: Not thin but not bushy, slight arch at the end. A fair amount of space between my eyes and eyebrows.

Chin: Sort of smaller.. doesn't jut out. Slight dimple in the bottom.

Mouth: A little wider than the widest part of my nose. Fuller bottom lip than top but neither are thin. Fairly well defined philtrum. Slightly downturned.

Nose: Very thin at the bridge. Sort of flat, kind of wider. Round tip, no hook but not upturned.

Ears: Small. Can't see them behind all my hair anyway.

Hair Color: Brown

\*\*Eyes:\*\*   A pretty standard shape. They're not really big or small. Very little eyelid is visible if I'm looking straight on. If I'm going to get arrested I'll definitely be doing it in some bold smoky eyeshadow look though

\*\*Eyebrows:\*\*  Standard low-maintenance shape. Medium width in terms of how much vertical space they take up, a gentle arch above the outer eye. Not very thick in terms of hair density. My eyebrow hairs are light brown so although they're reasonably thick in SHAPE they're not very \*full\* if that makes sense .

**Gender:** Male

**Head shape/jaw:** Heart? Idk I googled a thing about head shapes, it seemed oriented for women but I think it all works the same. I've always had a fairly neutral jaw. A few years ago I put on a couple pounds, but I think that hasn't affected it much.

**Eyes:** Even distance from eye to eye and ear to ear. I've always had nice lashes. Although recently I've been sporting bags from allergies/lack of sleep.

**Eye color:** Medium Brown. Like nutella.

**Eyebrows:** They're thick but not bushy, the left slopes down off the the corner of my eye, the right wants to the same but the edge of it keeps going until it fades away at the same point.

**Chin:** I haven't seen my chin for while because of the beard, but I'm feeling it and there is a slight upturn. It's very rounded too.

**Mouth:** The points of my lips are almost directly underneath my pupils. I have fairly thin, pink lips.

**Nose:** My nose tip is upturned, and the nostrils follow. It's not a crazy strong upturn though. My nostrils flare out a little bit too. The tip of the nose is rounded.

**Ears:** My ears are fairly hidden by my hair, but the ear hole is about on line with my cheekbones, I think.

**Hair color:** Dark Brown

**Hair style:** Long hair, parted far to the right, and *""groomed""* back. It curls at the ends and sits on my shoulder. The part on the left is slightly raised up because of the easy it's parted.

**Facial hair:** Patchy beard made of short springy hair. The hair is very curly, and doesn't really look that long. It looks like steel wool, I think. The beard clings close to my jawline and doesn't grow much further than that. I also have a tiny soul patch of short and straight hair.

**Skin tone:** White/caucasian, with a slight farmer's tan and bright red cheeks.

**Piercings:** N/A

**Tattoos:** N/A

**Miscellaneous:** I am wearing my button up hawaiian shirt, that I call my Charlie Sheen shirt. It's buttoned down two buttons so you can see some of my chest.

I’m so curious as to how somebody would draw me based on just a description. I feel I have a fairly unique looking face- though I may be biased. Also, I have zero drawing ability so anybody who can draw a human face amazes me! Here’s my detailed description:

**Gender:** Female

**Head Shape/jaw:** My face shape is fairly symmetrical oval (on the rounder side of oval) and jaw isn’t overly defined or prominent. Mildly prominent, slightly higher-set cheekbones.

**Eyes:** Quite large, symmetric elliptical shape. Very long eyelashes bottom and top. 

**Eye Color:** Dark turquoise.

**Eyebrows:** Not super high arches. Not overly thick but dense in volume. They are a straight curve over my eyes and then towards the end have that arch with the corner where they point down (inverted check mark kind of thing on the ends). They’re light brown in color and have very slight cowlicks on the inside areas closest to the bridge of the nose. There is the space of half of one of my eyebrow’s length between the eyebrows. They begin just past the corner of my eyes.

**Chin:** Chin is fairly small, not prominent. Just almost blends into the rest of my face. The space between where the bottom of my lips ends and the end of my chin is about the same as the space between where my nose ends and the top of my lip begins (Cupid’s bow area)

**Mouth:** mouth is wider than widest part of my nose (by maybe a 1/4 inch on each side). Bottom lip is significantly larger (more volume and surface area) than top lip. Cupid’s bow area is prominent. Are a fairly reddish pink colour naturally.

**Nose:** nose is fairly straight/flat. Doesn’t slope out too much. Bottom part of nose where nostrils and septum are is a little larger than the size of one of my eyes. Nostril holes are not super visible from head-on, are downward. Some slight freckles. Small clear crystal gem stud in left nostril.

**Ears:** Small, attached earlobes. Very ordinarily shaped. Nothing much remarkable about size or shape. Several piercings throughout. (Detailed in “piercings” section)

**Hair Color:** two different, slightly different shades of blonde peppered throughout. Not in a streaky, highlight type of way. Just blended in so it’s multi dimensional. Both are fairly golden/beige/darker shades of blonde.

**Hair Style:** Very long, all one length. Extremely thick and usually has a slight wave in it.

**Facial Hair:** None.

**Skin Tone:** White/Caucasian that is fairly tan and with more olive undertones.

**Piercings:** Small, clear crystal nose stud in left nostril. Left ear: oil slick colored hoop with bead closure in tragus. 3 diamond studs in a line in the lobe. Silver barbell through the rook with blue crystals on each side. Right ear: 2 diamond studs in a line in the lobe. 2 cartilage/helix diamond studs in a line. 2 diamond studs in a line in the forward helix. A curved barbell through my snug with clear crystals on each end. 
 
**Tattoos:** all are on my body not super visible. Also there’s 20 of them and not going to bore you with that like I did with my ear piercings.

**Misc.:** I am thin, 5’4 and about 120 pounds. I still get ID’d everywhere and they are usually reluctant to believe I am 25. I don’t usually wear much makeup. 

Will post a photo for comparison when drawings are posted",2019-10-10 08:31:38

[Discussion] Descriptions and descriptiveness.,2,dferhw,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliceSketchme/comments/dferhw/discussion_descriptions_and_descriptiveness/,1,1570643234.0,"So this subreddit is a great idea and I’m sold, I want to be a regular artist here because it’s going to help me get better at drawing portraits. I’m super stoked about this and I know the subreddit is being flooded right now with requests and sketches which is super great but I wanted to talk about the way some of you are describing yourselves for the sketches. 

What does “long hair” mean exactly? Is it long hair if it’s past the ears on a man? Is it long hair if it’s past the chin? What is medium hair? Or short for that matter? Instead of using long, medium or short you should try giving reference points. Does your hair fall over your eyes? Past your jaw?

What does your nose look like? Is it tall and hooked? Is it upturned? Is it flat? Is it round? Calling it “big” or “normal” isn’t helpful. What’s a normal nose? What’s a big nose? What do your eyes look like? Are they down turned? Do you have heavy lids? Do you have big round eyes? Do you have thin eyes? Do you have a high forehead? Are your eyebrows arched? Is your bottom lip thick or thin? Is your top lip thick or thin? Does the corners of your mouth turn up? Or down? Do you have moles or freckles or dimples? 

Trying to describe your own face can be very difficult, I understand, but the sketches you get will be more accurate when you give as many details as possible. On top of that, there are sketches I want to do that I find myself pausing on because I can’t work out exactly what “long” hair is supposed to be. It’s okay if you stumble on the little details but the big things, face/chin/jaw/hairline/eye/nose/mouth shape and size are the big ones. If you can give more detailed descriptions on those things you’ll give the artist more information to work with. It’s okay if you prattle on for a whole paragraph about your nose, I promise I don’t mind reading it.",2019-10-10 01:47:14

Chin: Slightly rounded. About 2.5 - 3"" wide.

Head Shape/Jaw: Skinny. Upper two thirds are like an oval, lower third is like a pinched trapezoid. 

Eyes: The usual two sideways ovals with both edges pinched slightly. Covered by thick-black-framed, rectangular glasses. My irises line up with my chin.

Eye Color: outer rim of iris: blue. inner iris: forest green.

Eye Brows: brown colored, tilted *ever so slightly* inward. The outside of each brow goes up in a slight curve, but down in a straight line. My right eyebrow (to your left) is always raised slightly higher than the other one. 

Mouth: As wide as my chin. I have slightly fuller lips than most guys, but not so much that you'd mistake me for a lady ;)

Nose: Large and a little round, but not Elmer Fudd large and round. About half as wide as my chin. My left nostril (your right) doesn't jut out quiet as far as the other one. 

Ears: Flat. If you look straight at my face, they only stick out about a 
half inch. My right ear (your left) tilts down slightly, though.
Hair Color: Brownish red.

Hair Style: Buzz cut... except not as neat. Imagine a military burr that hasn't been trimmed in a week or two. Yeah, that. My hairline curves down slightly, but doesn't create any noticeable widow's peak.

Facial Hair: Not cleanly shaven. I had a soul patch 3 weeks ago, but I lost my razor and have been too lazy to buy another one... so imagine that. I have a solid coat of beard lining the bottom edge of my face... but my facial hair grows slowly so it's not ZZ top material or anything. I have facial hair on my upper lip... but it's way too pitifully thin to call a ""moustache"". Imagine a skinny neckbeard without a fedora... that's me.

[Request] I think my description of individual features is very ugly but somehow the overall result isn't that bad,1,dgg4a2,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliceSketchme/comments/dgg4a2/request_i_think_my_description_of_individual/,2,1570833598.0,"Gender: Female

Head shape/jaw: Slight heart shape but with a more square jaw. More oval than round but with a low forehead/hairline, cheekbones are defined but jaw is also defined so the heart-shape isn't as obvious as it is on people with more V shaped jaw. Also, straight face in the profile (as in, neither upper nor lower part of my face sticks out compared to each other - not to be confused with flat because I have a defined nose)

Eyes: not too big or too small, not too wide or too close (eye width distance between my eyes), just slightly droopy (not always obvious), heavy eyelids, sometimes bags around the eyes when sleepy. Left eye is a little droopier but I think I'm the only one who realizes this fully

Eye color: dark blue-grey, such color that most people dont realize I have blue eyes (I had people see then as green or remember them as brown)

Eyebrows:  simple and very slight arch, dark brown, not thick but not weirdly thin either. Start and finish a little before/after the width of my eye.

Chin: defined but not protruding, defined jawline but not to a manly looking extent

Mouth: about the same width as my nose (maybe just slightly wider) and my eye when not smiling. Lips neither thick nor thin. Sometimes have a slight natural lower lip pout, but really slight.

Nose: pretty strong but very straight shaped and pointing slightly up (but really very slightly). It's neither long nor short on my face, just pretty... formidable in it's construction 

Ears: Normal I guess, earlobes not connected

Hair color: Medium tone brown (mousy? - see people comparisons for the bottom to get a better idea)

Hair style: Below shoulder length, very very thick hair, straight, no special style possible except some slight layering in the front (from chin down)

Facial hair: None 

Skin tone: Very white

Piercings: None 

Tattoos: None

Misc.:

1. I would say that from my chin to my nose, nose to eyebrows and eyebrows to forehead is about the same height

2. People I've been compared with (usually any famous white woman with long brown hair and blue eyes):  Jennifer Aniston (most common comparison since I was a kid), Sandra Bullock (I dont see it but few people swear on it), Avril Lavigne (brown hair blue eyes apparently always looks the same, plus some similar style especially back in the day), ""the Kennedys"" (whatever that means, I'm thinking maybe Carolyne), Elizabeth Hurley (my favorite but only got it once or twice), Kate Middleton (that thing with brown hair blue eyes). Obviously no one will compare me to an ugly person to my face cause it's not nice, so take this with a grain of salt.

Chin: slightly protruding from my jawline but not too noticeably. there's a small cleft as well. 

Mouth: average-sized mouth. i take good care of my lips, which people often describe as relatively large for a white girl. not Big Mouth large, but the nice large if you know what i’m trying to say lol. my bottom lip is more prominent but they're both considerably-sized. i have two freckles on the left side of my mouth, which are close to my smile line.

I find that interesting... I think it’s due being sort of ambiguous when it comes to race; I’m so many different nationalities! This makes me wonder how an artist would visualize me.

****DESCRIPTION****

Gender: Female [20]

Head shape/jaw: Not very oval, not very round either. My forehead is ~just~ a tad big, but not too noticeable. My cheeks have a bit of a cute chub despite that I’m fairly thin, and my cheekbones are like round little apples.

Eyes: My eyes are on the rounder side, so I usually wear winged eyeliner and colorful smoke eyeshadow to give the illusion of an almond shape. I have a slight hooded eyelid, so my eyes don’t look deep-set. The distance between my brow and actual lid crease seems taller than most people’s!

Eye color: Brown

Eyebrows: Naturally on the thin side, but not sparse if that makes sense. Dark but not *girthy* LOL. They have an arch, but more rounded than sharp. They’re a bit longer than the length of my eye from inner corner to outer corner.

Chin: Normal for the most part, I have a very little dimple that you can only see at certain moments, almost like a tiny poke, not a butt chin!

Mouth: Plump lips, I would say it’s my most confident of my features! My upper lip is medium sized with two roundish ‘humps’ where the cupid’s bow is. My bottom lip is full and taller than my upper lip, and looks like its composed of two main sideways ovals.

Nose: From the front, the bridge is medium in length and width, and the tip of my nose like a round little button. Round nostrils.

Ears: My ears are covered by my hair 99% of the time!

Hair color: I have dark brown hair- almost black, with blonde streaks at the end. 

Hair: It’s parted on my right side but not very dramatic of a part. I keep my hair straightened and it’s very long and thick! No layers.

Facial hair: None

Skin tone: I’m olive skin-toned!

Piercings: Nose ring hoop on my right side!

Tattoos: None

Misc.: A line under my eyes, not a bag per-se, it’s actually kinda cute. Freckles are not like how ginger’s freckles are, they’re random little circular dots that aren’t very noticeable or dense, mostly on my nose and less on my cheeks.

 \*\*Head shape/jaw:\*\*  Narrower at the bottom than at the top, small cheekbones, pretty straight jawline.

 \*\*Eyes:\*\*   Thick lashes, pretty generic shape, lower lids slightly more defined than normal.

\*\*Eye color:\*\*   Light Brown

\*\*Eyebrows:\*\*   Easily my best feature. Darker than my hair, even width slightly upward from the center of my face, then tapering out and down for about a third of the length.

\*\*Chin:\*\*   In line with my jaw, with a very mild cleft that I might as well not mention because it's felt, but not easily seen unless the lighting is good.

\*\*Mouth:\*\*  Thinner upper lip than lower, pretty smooth lines until the edges, which are slightly defined.

 \*\*Nose:\*\*   My smallest feature. The ridge is probably like a normal width, but it doesn't significantly widen at the nostrils.

\*\*Ears:\*\*   I have nothing to say here. Straight on, they're shaped like violin halves. As most ears are.

\*\*Hair color:\*\*   I've been described as brown and also as dirty blonde. It depends on the season. Can I say mousy?

\*\*Hair style:\*\*   Buzzed on the sides, maybe a little more than an inch on the top, parted left to right. Stick straight.

\*\*Facial hair:\*\*   I keep it shaved right to the skin; I can't grow facial hair to save my life. Pray for me.

\*\*Skin tone:\*\*   Light skin, sometimes blotchy if I don't moisturize. Warmer undertones? In one word: yellowish.

I hope my description is good enough to warrant a drawing, I'm excited to see how it turns out!  Thanks a bunch to all of you!

Gender: Male

Head shape/jaw: An oval shaped face but with a pointed chin.

Eyes: Thin for a white guy, a little sunken but it seems that way because of a large brow bone.

Eye color: Green with hints of blue and grey. A dark ring around the outside. Somewhat serious

Eyebrows: Bushy but not BUSHY. A dirty blonde that looks kinda brown. Well-kept enough to say they're well-kept, but not a model by any means.

Chin: strong and prominent, comes to a sharp end

Mouth: Thin lips, slight curl to them.

Nose: Thin with a bit of a round tip. Nothing special, very slight crook but definitely no Dante Alighieri.

Ears: Average size, but they stick out just a little. A distinct earlobe but no separation from the head there.

Hair color: Dirty blonde/Brown. For all hair, wherever it's thinner it seems more blonde.

Hair style: A simple part, but my hair is stiff and thick with a little wave in it, so it's not quick as clean as the average 50's man would have had.  When it gets longer it starts to curl.

Facial hair: A beard. A little more blonde than the rest. The picture I linked to has a shorter beard than I like to keep it. I normally like a Chris Evans in Avengers: Infinity War, but the reference shows more of a number three razor. It's a little thin around the cheeks but not by much.

Skin tone: White. A little tan but you can tell I'm an Irish + Scottish mutt.

Piercings: None

Tattoos: None

Miscellaneous: A few forehead wrinkles, which is weird for a young man but here we are... Very strong brow bone. Cheek bones are visible, but not quite as sharp as Peter Cushing.",2019-10-11 13:51:43

**Head shape/jaw:** rectangular-ish face, slightly prominent cheekbones on the sides but not through my face, jaw widens to be kind of boxy. widest part of my face are the edge of my cheekbones, just slightly wider than my jaw on both sides.

**Eyes:** average sized eyes, oval shaped, medium-dark eyelashes that are short but curl up on the ends

**Eye color:** blue/green that looks kind of like a cool steely gray in some lights? but my drivers license just says blue lol

**Eyebrows:** normally very very faint, but i pencil them in every day (usually the only makeup i wear) so they're the same shade as my hair. they start a bit thicker at the point closest to my nose and then narrow to a point with a very slight arch, but they're pretty straight across.

**Chin:** very slightly prominent/protruding, kinda looks like someone attached a small half-oval midway through my jaw

**Mouth:** pretty small, lips slightly turned up at edges. upper lip is thin but has a very distinct cupids bow shape, bottom lip a bit thicker but still thin (tragic)

**Nose:** standard width, the tip of my nose is a bit more circular/wide. the line of the profile is a very straight slanting line to the tip, where it then curls under at a soft angle.

**Ears:** nothing special size-wise here - detached earlobes. my right ear is slightly higher than my left, so whenever i wear glasses they're lopsided!

**Hair color:** in one of those ridiculous hair dye charts it would be described as ""sparkling amber"" or ""hot toffee"". take that as you will. its a very soft brown / dark blonde at the roots and gets slightly lighter by the tips.

**Hair style:** very straight with a slight wave on the bottom. longest bit hits right at my sternum is in between fine and medium texture-wise. i part my hair in the middle and the front strands are slightly longer than the rest so my hair gets a bit shorter as it reaches my shoulder.

**Facial hair:** none

**Skin tone:** white with tons and tons of freckles that get fainter in the winter. mole above the arch of my left eyebrow.

**Piercings:** small silver nose ring on my left nostril and a silver ring on the cartilage of my right ear.

**Tattoos:** one on my left arm. the berlin bear crest but done in a more sketchy/goofy style. black lines with red claws and tongue.

After binging iZombie and listening to some really colorful descriptions of people I'd love to see how close I can get describing my SO.

**Gender:** Male, 23 

**Head shape/jaw:** Oval head shape, jaw line slightly rounded square. He cant cut glass with his jaw line, but he could definitely scratch it up.

**Eyes:** Smaller almonds and a little droopy like hes sleepy.  When he takes pictures I have to remind him to open his eyes. They're a little wider apart

**Eye color:** Green

**Eyebrows:** Thicker and straight, he has the smallest arch in his right eyebrow that tappers down

**Chin:** Rounded and a little elongated from his mouth. When he smiles he has two lines that extend from his cheekbones and settle on either side of his chin distinguishing his chin from his jaw.

**Mouth:** He has some nice full lips. His cupids bow is noticeable, even when he smiles. His top lip and bottom match in fullness. The ends of his mouth curl upward so even in neutral positioning he looks like hes smiling a little

**Nose:** He thinks his nose is massive, I think its proportionate to his face. Its wide and round, his nostrils are round, the ball of his nose is round and not pointy at all. The bridge of his nose is wide

**Ears:** Bigger ears that stick out from his head. The top of his ear sticks out a little further than the bottom. His ear lobes are disconnected. They're a little on the larger side

**Hair color:** Very dark brown.

**Hair style:** Longer on top, shorter on the sides. He likes to gel it back to give it some volume and poof. His barber likes to cut his sideburns shorter than he prefers, so they end right at the top of his ears. His hairline is square

**Facial hair:** Five o'clock shadow circle beard, his mustache and beard juuust barely connect. In pictures the mustache and beard look disconnected. There is a patch of hair that grows under his bottom lip but it doesn't connect to his chin.

**Skin tone:** Tan with red undertones in his face, yellow undertones for the rest of his body.

**Piercings:** No piercings

**Tattoos:** None

**Gender:** Female

**Height/build:** 5’, a little chubby with an hourglass figure.

**Head shape/jaw:** Full cheeks, oval top with a very defined chin.

Hey! I saw this subreddit recommended to me and think it’s such a cool idea. If you want to draw me go ahead, I would love to see your interpretation of how I describe myself

Gender: Female

Head shape/jaw: Oval shaped, I have an average sized forehead, maybe 1 1/2-2 inches tall

Eyes: Regular sized, I would say almond shaped leaning a little bit towards round with an average width apart

Eye color: it shifts from a deeper green to gray depending on the time

Eyebrows: medium brown, somewhat arched, they aren’t plucked so not fully clean but not sporadic or blobby. They are fuller in the middle and more sparse on the tails

Chin: more of a rounded point, I have a butt chin so I have a little line down the middle

Mouth: Dull pink, a little bit of a larger bottom and slight flat top lip, the corners of my mouth are slightly upturned

Nose: I would describe it as average, a little more round tip when looking head on

Ears: Average sized, one hole on each line from an old ear piercing, the bottom of my ears line up with the top of the little ball at the bottom of your nose (the rounded part near your nostrils) 

Hair color: Medium brown

Hair style: my hair is straight and a little thick. It goes down about an inch and a half past my shoulders. It stays pretty close to my face, so I would describe it as fluffed out but not super fluffy if that makes sense. Like it looks full but is smoothed down

Facial hair: None

Skin tone: beige

Piercings: I have a nostril piercing with a small black hoop in on the right side of my nose when you look at me, and a septum piercing with jewelry that is a black half hoop with a black ball on each end (typical septum jewelry)

Tattoos: None above the shoulders

Misc: I have rosacea so my face is slightly pinker on my cheeks and nose, I have a dimple just under my eye on my right side when you face me.

**Mouth:** My lips are medium-sized, and the upper lip is as full as the lower lip. They have a prominent cupid's bow, and are medium-full in thickness.

**Nose:** On the smaller-medium size, with the width not being too much. It's slightly pointy, and my alars aren't flared. It's a less generic form of an asian nose as it isn't flat or wide.

**Ears:** Preeeeettty basic, nothing super special (apart from a hole in the crux of my helix that I have had since birth)

**Hair color:** Darkest brown.

**Hair style:** My hair's past my shoulders, almost until the middle of my heart. It's oomphy, yikes, I don't know how to describe it. It has quite a bit of volume, and is on the straighter but bouncy side.

**Facial hair:** None.

**Skin tone:** Tan

**Piercings:** None

**Tattoos:** None

**Miscellaneous:** People mistake me for a teen, because apparently I don't look my age. I do not agree with this, but hey, you get what you get.",2019-10-10 13:19:16

Honestly, I sometimes joke that if I'm ever arrested they'll use my license photo on the news (it's bad guys, I look psychotic 😬) But if I'm not caught and there's only witnesses it would be interesting to see what might be put out.. you know.. if I ever decide to go on a crime spree or something that is 😅
Actually.. why don't we pretend I did? Maybe I'm some kind of weird flasher or I was spotted stealing the hood ornaments off of cars, maybe I was running around cussing at old ladies, or maybe I was seen leaving squashes with vulgar phrases on them at the park? 😏
Aaaaanyway... I'm on the plus size side but not grossly obese and also I recently had an epiphany about my personal style: YMCA lost and found. I wear round gold/metal framed glasses.

Gender: Female

Face shape: Round face, nice cheekbones, slight double chin

Eye shape: Roundish almondish? Hooded eyelids

Eye color: light grey blue with a dot of brown in my right iris

Eyebrows: Natural growth? No unibrow. Maybe a medium arch

Chin: I have one. It's not pointy, small but nice, rounded.

Lip shape: Nice lips I think. Full but not huge and obnoxious, medium cupids bow? Naturally pink.

Nose: Rounded tip. A little like a Who but not nearly as angled up. If it help's my dad's nose looks like Jim Belushi's.

Ears: They're ears. Not close to my head, they come out a bit but they are small. Except I think I have chubby earlobes (is that a thing?)

Hair color: Red/brown with highlights. Comes down just past my shoulders

Hair style: Naturally curly. Think Merida from Brave

Facial hair: None. But if I was committing a crime I might wear a fake mustache...

Skin tone: Caucasian. My cheeks get very red

Piercings: Snake bites on my lower lip

Tattoos: A skull and crossbones. The skull has a green bow and there are spiderwebs under it with tiny hearts around it

Misc: I have lots of freckles. On my cheeks and under my eyes. Also a scar in the middle of my forehead it isn't huge just a straight line maybe 2.5 cm?

**Eye color:** Dark blue with a little green I think

**Eyebrows:** Dark brown, I don’t really have a natural arch, but I do trim them to a point where I have a small arch 

**Chin:** Normal I guess? It’s not pointy and it sticks out a little bit from my jaw line 

**Mouth:** My bottom lip is a little bigger than my top, and the corners go a little farther than the corners of my eyes. When I’m not smiling, it usually falls into a slight frown. 

**Nose:** A little bit bigger than normal I think (but my friends tell me it fits my face, idk how right they are), there’s nothing that different about it, I don’t have a bump, it’s rounded at the end and doesn’t round down at the end either 

**Ears:** Pretty average, I do think that they stick out the slightest bit more than normal but other than that they’re not that different. They’re rounded

**Gender:** Female

**Head shape/jaw:** Long and narrow face. The midsection of my face is slightly long, but overall my features are pretty balanced in placement. I have a steep jawline and once got told by my little sister's mean friend that I looked like her dachshund. My jawline from the front view is gently tapered from under the ears to the sides of my chin. When I was 16, an older gentleman at an art store told me that my head was shaped like an upside down egg, then invited me to his studio to presumably molest me.

**Cheekbones:** Visible, but not protruding. There's definitely a shadow from them but they're not gaunt. 

**Forehead:**  Average, verging on large

**Eyes:** Almond shaped, medium sized, hooded, evenly spaced, they used to be upturned at the corners but kind of rounded out/drooped a bit with age and seeing some shit. Naturally large pupils. Long lashes that are brown at the roots and blonde/nearly clear at the tips.

**Eye color:** Bluish-grey. Some people have said green. I've never said ""they change with my mood"".

**Eyebrows:** Light brown. Medium thickness. Pretty straight no matter how much I try to arch them out. They have a softly curved arch at the end if I bother doing them with makeup. My right one is naturally more arched and the better looking sister. The left one is the flatter but has a great personality. 

**Chin:** Wide, squarish, slightly recessed from the side view but not flat or anything, kinda long/big, but just small enough to still fit with the rest of my face. When I press my lips together, my chin puckers a bit.

**Mouth:** On the small side. My lips naturally part a bit at rest. Medium philtrum. Upper lip is thinner than the lower. Pretty prominent Cupid's bow. Lower lip is rounded and kinda full when in repose but thins out when my mouth is closed. The left side of my mouth is slightly lower than the right. 

**Nose:** Narrow-medium width. Proportionate to face. Prominent from side view and almost completely straight. The tip is gently rounded and slightly upturned but still kinda pointy looking. Medium nostrils.

**Ears:** Small and not prominent. They're fused at the helices. Detached earlobes. 

**Hair color:** White blonde. My naturally light brown roots are juuuust starting to grow in. I'll need to touch them up soon.

**Hair style:** Shoulder length, kind of wavy, and layered. In the photo I'm going to post, it's tied back with messy, wavy pieces falling on the sides. Parted on the left (but it looks like the right because I took a selfie with the front facing camera) with slightly short side swept bangs.

**Facial hair:** none

**Skin tone:** Pale, a true neutral undertone

**Piercings:** One piercing on each lobe. I have preauricular pits though, and people think they're piercing holes.

**Tattoos:** None

**Miscellaneous:** Slightly indented acne scars on my cheeks. Deep smile lines/parentheses  when I smile. Obviously ugly enough growing up to use humor as a coping mechanism and attractive enough as an adult to not be good at it.

I too came here from that askreddit post, and I'm posting because this seems really cool.

This is a description of me I am getting from a friend I videocalled just for this post because they are likely more descriptive and less biased than I am lmao.

So here goes nothing

Gender: male

Head shape/jaw: my head is oval-shaped and my jaw isn't very well defined close to the ends.

Eyes: My eyes are deeply inset into my head, and I have 'large eyelids, particularly the upper ones'. I have pretty relaxed looking eyes but 'more dead'. My eyelashes are 'really straight' and 'could use mascara'. 

Eye color: My eyes are dark brown but not so dark that they seem black.

Eyebrows: My eyebrows are very short, pretty widely spaced, full, and very straight. According to my friend I have nice eyebrows.

Chin: I have a pretty standard looking chin.

Mouth: The ends of my lips align with my pupils. I have a fuller bottom lip than top lip.

Nose: I have a nose that is large but not large enough that it is my defining feature or anything. I have been told that my nose looks like Ranveer Singh's nose.

Ears: they are kinda small and are pretty flat alongside my head.

Hair color: black

Hair style: My hair is mostly wavy, but when it is short it is really, really straight. My hair is really coarse and dense. Right now my hair is around 4 inches on the top and shorter on the sides and back. I part my hair on the right and my hair is generally slightly unruly.

Facial hair: I have some stubble on my cheeks along my jaw and below my sideburns. I have a wispy beard with hair that is like a centimeter or maybe two long and I have a faint moustache. As a disclaimer my brother has told me to cut the pubes off of my chin, but he also hates everything about my face.

Skin tone: I'm pretty light-skinned for a brown person but not to the point that I look like a white person with a summer tan. I look like Randeep Hooda in terms of skin color.

Piercings: none

Tattoos: none

Miscellaneous:  I have light acne scars across my cheeks that give me a faint reddish complexion across my cheeks. 

If anyone does this I'll put a picture of me up.

Gender: Female

Age: Early 30s

Race: Caucasian

Head Shape/Jaw: Rectangular and somewhat flat on top; jaw edges taper and round slightly toward the chin.

Chin: Wide—about as wide as the mouth; it protrudes slightly and separately from the rest of the facial outline. 

Eyes: Eye shape is somewhere between round and almond-shaped. Not particularly upturned at the outer corners. Bottom lid is rounded and at its apex is lower than the inner corners of the eyes.

Eye Color: Hazel (brown/greenish). 

Eye Brows: Somewhat thin. Long, in that they seem to reach around to the side of my head. They rest on the edge of a prominent brow bone. Very slight, subtle rounded arch toward the outer corners.

Mouth: Corners a little upturned. Only slightly wider than nose. Lips are somewhat thin, but bottom lip is thicker. Outer edge of bottom lip has a wide ""V"" shape to it.

Nose: Hourglass shape to it—where it tapers in the center of the ""hourglass"" is at the level just below the lower lid of my eye; then it flares out again toward the nose tip. About 3/4 inch above my upper lip. At its widest point it is about as wide as my eyes are apart. The nostrils are small and comma shaped. Bottom 1/2 of nose veers to the left and the left side of nose is more rounded and less defined.

Head Shape/Jaw: Roundish shaped face. Average jaw.

Eyes: Conventionally attractive eyes. Left is more shut than the other and both have tired purplish tones underneath. Not hugely noticeable. 

Eye Color: Medium blue.

Eye Brows: Quite bushy but well maintained, standard shape. The one on my left hand side is pierced, the piercing is plain steel spikes. 

Chin: Quarter of the way to being a butt chin. Left hand side protrudes slightly further than the right but it's not really noticeable unless you're looking for it.

Mouth: Quite thin lips. When I smile the right side goes up first. Bottom lip tends to be a bit chapped in the middle.

Nose: Well here's the big one. When viewed from my right, it looks straight. From the left, there's a pronounced crook in the bridge. It curves slightly to the left in the middle but comes back at the slightly bulbous tip. Quite wide nostrils. Like someone with a regular nose flaring their nostrils but that's me all the time. Doesn't point up or down at the tip. Just straight on. 

Ears: Right ear slightly pointy and sticks out further than my left which is a fairly average looking ear. Both have fairly large lobes, not huge but the kind that are fun to flick for a few minutes if you're bored.

Hair Color: Golden brown. 

Hair Style: Shortish/mid, slightly balding in the front, parting on my right hand side.

Facial Hair: Beard and tache. The beard is full from ear to ear but quite short. Longer than stubble but not glorious enough for r/beards. My chin however is covered in golden hair longer than that on my head. It's usually waxed into a scruffy ducktail. My tache is separate from the beard and is trimmed so that it doesn't spill over my top lip.

Skin Tone: Pretty bad complexion, oily forehead, a few bumps from huge spots long gone on my nose. Caucasian, caught a little sun this summer but not much.

My head/face not quite round or chubby, but it narrows towards my jaw and is a bit wider at the top of my head.  My cheeks are chubby though, everybody has always talked about pinching them :(

Eyes: Oval shaped like a football, squinty when I smile or laugh, almost looks like I could have Asian in me (I'm very white, mostly Irish, but maybe some Russian)

Eye Color: Hazel, usually more brown but closer to the pupil is green

Eye Brows: Not too arched, very natural looking.  They curve down at the ends and start to get thinner but they're pretty thick.  I lucked out and don't need to do much to them when I wear makeup.  

Chin: Sort of square but also slightly round, not very prominent at all.  But it does get pointy when I smile.

Mouth: Average, not too thin or very thick.  Smile curves upwards a bit to the left

Nose: Thin, petite nose that widens slightly at the end/nostrils. Slightly curved in right between and below my eyes, reminds me of a playground slide or a mountain slope

Ears: Attached earlobes, they stick out just a tad and are fairly average in size.  I think they fit my head well ;)

Hair Color: Brown with a slight hint of dark red right now, but I'm naturally a dark blonde

Hair Style: Usually a pixie cut, although it's currently grown out just a bit, covers my ears now.  My part is almost directly in the center, but I part it just slightly to the right and I have a cowlick that forces my hair to lay to the left in the front, basically like bangs that sweep to the left.

- **Gender:** Male

- **Head Shape/Jaw:** Egg/oval shaped, maybe sliiiiightly bigger at the top of the egg than bottom.

- **Eyes:** Thin fooball shaped eyes, but not Asain-thin. Average distance apart, some darkening under the eyes, very slight baggage underneath

- **Eye Color:** Brown. Whites are currently slightly bloodshot because, well...yanno...

- **Eye Brows:** Average. Not overly bushy or thin.

- **Chin:** Mostly indistinguishable due to beard.

- **Mouth:** From end to end, my lips line up vertically to about the middle of each eye, maybe slightly less. Every so slightly thicker-than-normal lips. (In the example, is ""frenulum"" really the word to use here?)

- **Nose:** Average length nose. Slightly sharp. About as wide as my eyes are apart.

- **Ears:** Unattached earlobes, but when staring from straight on, can't see the bottom. Tops of ears stick out about half inch from head.

- **Hair Color:** Black

- **Hair Style:** Shaved head. Thinning hair. I'm in my 30s and have male pattern baldness that is slowly turning horseshoe-shaped around my head. It's not fully there yet and I shave my head with an electric razor so there's still some hair there (it's not Michael Jordan smooth). Think Jason Statham's hair.

- **Facial Hair:** Beard is black, hairs are about half an inch long, but it's thick. I trim it down every month or so, so it's stays at about a 2-month growth level. It's a full beard (sides, chin, mustache and sides of mouth). I do keep my cheeks trimmed, it's not growing out of control or anything. It's shapely.",2015-09-05 19:38:11

Chin: average size chin, kind of square. 

Mouth: top lip starts about 1/2 inch below my nose. Average fullness, they end pretty much straight below my pupils. Bottom lip is average fullness, about 1 & 1/4 inches above the bottom of my chin.

Hair Style: shoulder length, parted on my left (3/4 combed over to the right). My hair is absolutely bizarre. It is wavy, but there are several sections along the right side and in the back that get REAL curly, like almost ringlets. I used to hate it and straightened it every day, but in the last year or so I've just started rolling out of bed in the morning and going with it. I would say it just looks crazy. The only thing I do sometimes is a small French braid across the front right side held back with a small hair clip.

Eye Color: Chocolate brown with flecks of amber. The iris is ringed in a dark brown.

Chin: slightly rounded with a little extra underneath. Not like a turkey(gobble gobble). No but chin, 

Mouth: half a centimeter shorter on each side as the outer corners of my eyes are from each other. Thin lips with a slightly thicker bottom lip.

[Request] Do me!!,0,3jp39j,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliceSketchme/comments/3jp39j/request_do_me/,0,1441448032.0,"Hello, just discovered this sub and thought it sounded super fun! Thought I'd put up a description and see what happens.

Gender: Male
Age: 21 (look to be 23/24ish)
Race: Caucasian
Head Shape/Jaw: Somewhat rectangular shape. No prominent edges, slightly curved jaw however it's not completely round.
Eyes: Almond-shaped eyes. Slightly deep set within my face. Equally spaced from my nose at about half an eye's width.
Eye Color: Both eyes are a very dark brown and the same color throughout.
Eye Brows: A little thin. They look like they're well manicured but I never touch them.
Chin: Well toned. A very slight cleft in it, though it's more like a dent than an actual cleft.
Mouth: Both upper and lower lip are the same size, rather small. About average width.
Nose: Small indentation (almost like a cleft) on the tip of my nose, the underside slopes up while the rest of my nose makes a slight hook. Rather than a full on hook nose it's more of a bump along the bridge.
Ears: Go from the top of my nostrils to my eyebrows. Mostly flat against my head with only slight protrusion.
Hair Color: Dark brown.
Hair Style: Very short on the sides with the top being somewhat longer (about 1.5"") and it is spiked/swooshed up and over to the side. (Imagine like ///)
Facial Hair: I have some scruff that covers the majority of my jaw though the tips of my ""stache"" and my beard do not meet. For some reason no hair grows in that small region.
Miscellaneous Features: I have two small scars going horizontally down between my lower lip and chin from a cat scratch. Also have a mole (not super dark) on my upper lip on the right side close to my nostril. My brow is also rather heavy so it casts somewhat deep shadows on my eyes. 

Good Luck!",2015-09-05 18:13:52

Gender: female

Age: 20

Head Shape/Jaw: oval face (almost round but not quite) jaw tapers in but not quite into a point, rounded chin, high cheekbones but not very prominent.

Eyes: Almond shaped, with both inner and outer corners aligned in a straight line perpendicular to my nose. About as far apart as they are wide. 

Eye Color: reddish brown, almost auburn colored with a dark green ring around the edge of the iris.

Eye Brows: match the curve of my upper lid, not super thick but definitely not pencil thin, light auburn in color 

Chin: rounded, as described above. Not very deep, no cleft. 

Mouth: full lower lip, relatively equal width along its length but does taper up to meet the top lip at the corners. Top lip not as full as bottom. Does not have a sharp v shape in the middle but does dip into a smooth curve in the middle of the upper lip. Naturally blush colored.

Nose: bottom of nose equal height of beginning of earlobe. Relatively triangular in shape (think isoceles triangle). Bottom of nose from nostril to nostril a little less wide than eye width. Nose tip points at a very slight angle upwards but barely noticeable from front view. 

Ears: top of ear about level with center line going through eyes. Earlobe about equal with mouth as described above. Earlobes attached. Ears stick out slightly more than average female but not so much it's ridiculous. 

Hair Color: light auburn (a little lighter than eyebrows)

Hair Style: just past shoulders, always down, wavy leaning towards curly but not frizzy. Parted with more hair on my left side (your right) with bangs (fringe) sweeping from my right to left (your left to right) with part.
