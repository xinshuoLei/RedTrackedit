The FCC Is Blocking a Law Enforcement Investigation Into Net Neutrality Comment Fraud,119519,7k7z00,https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/wjzjv9/net-neutrality-fraud-ny-attorney-general-investigation?utm_source=mbtwitter,3123,1513471369.0,,2017-12-17 08:42:49
Comcast is trying to censor our pro-net neutrality website that calls for an investigation into fake FCC comments potentially funded by the cable lobby,114341,6cvg82,https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6cvg82/comcast_is_trying_to_censor_our_pronet_neutrality/,2507,1495583001.0,"Fight for the Future has received [a cease and desist order](http://imgur.com/a/BI7YZ) from Comcast’s lawyers, claiming that [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com) - a pro-net neutrality site encouraging Internet users to investigate an astroturfing campaign possibly funded by the cable lobby - violates Comcast’s ""valuable intellectual property."" The letter threatens legal action if the domain is not transferred to Comcast’s control.

The notice is ironic, in that it’s a perfect example of why we need Title II based net neutrality protections that ban ISPs from blocking or throttling content. 

**If the FCC’s current proposal is enacted, there would be nothing preventing Comcast from simply censoring this site -- or other sites critical of their corporate policies -- without even bothering with lawyers.**

The legal notice can be viewed [here](http://imgur.com/a/BI7YZ). It claims that [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com) violates the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act and infringes on Comcast’s trademarks. Of course, these claims are legally baseless, since the site is clearly a form of First Amendment protected political speech and makes no attempt to impersonate Comcast. (See the case ""[Bosley Medical Institute vs. Kremer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosley_Medical_Institute,_Inc._v._Kremer)"" which held that a site critical of a company’s practices could not be considered trademark infringement, or the case Taubman vs. Webfeats, which decided that *sucks.com domain names—in this case taubmansucks.com—were free speech)

[Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com) criticizes the cable lobby and encourages Internet users to search the Federal Communication Commission (FCC)’s docket to check if a fake comment was submitted using their name and address to attack Title II based net neutrality protections. It has been [widely reported](https://www.bna.com/fcc-set-move-n73014451155/) that more than 450,000 of these comments have been submitted to the FCC -- and as a result of the site at [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com), Fight for the Future [has heard](https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-05-18-fcc-ignores-growing-evidence-of-fraud-moves-ahead/) from dozens of people who say that anti-net neutrality comments were submitted using their personal information without their permission. We have connected individuals with Attorneys Generals and have called for the FCC act immediately to investigate this potential fraud.

Companies like Comcast have a long history of funding shady astroturfing operations like the one we are trying to expose with [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com), and also a long history of engaging in censorship. This is exactly why we need net neutrality rules, and why we can’t trust companies like Comcast to just ""behave"" when they have abused their power time and time again.

Fight for the Future has no intention of taking down [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com), and we would be happy to discuss the matter with Comcast in court.

There's a huge amount of momentum. This morning PornHub (with 75 million daily visitors) [announced](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/pornhub-will-show-its-75-million-daily-visitors-why-net-neutrality-matters) that they will be participating. Since we announced earlier this month a ton of other high-traffic sites have signed on including Imgur, Amazon, Namecheap, OK Cupid, Bittorrent, Mozilla, Kickstarter, Etsy, GitHub, Vimeo, Chess.com, Fark, Checkout.com, Y Combinator, and Private Internet Access. 

Reddit itself has also joined, [along with](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6g9pkl/reddit_lets_get_organized_more_than_30_subreddits/) more than 30 subreddits!

Net neutrality is the basic principle that prevents Internet Service Providers like Comcast and Verizon from charging us extra fees to access the content we want -- or throttling, blocking, and censoring websites and apps. Title II is the legal framework for net neutrality, and the FCC is trying to get rid of it, under immense pressure for the Cable lobby.

This day of action is an incredibly important moment for the Internet to come together -- across political lines -- and show that we don't want our Cable companies controlling what we can do online, or picking winners and losers when it comes to streaming services, games, and online content.

The current FCC chairman, Ajit Pai, is a former Verizon lawyer and seems intent on getting rid of net neutrality and misleading the public about it. But the FCC has to answer to Congress. If we can create another moment of massive online protest like the SOPA Blackout and the Internet Slowdown, we have a real chance of stopping the FCC in its tracks, and protecting the Internet as a free and open platform for creativity, innovation, and exchange of ideas. 

So! If you've got a website, blog, Tumblr, or any kind of social media following, or if you are a subreddit mod or active in an online community or forum, please get involved! There's so much we as redditors can do, from blacking out our sites to drive emails and phone calls to organizing in-person meetings with our lawmakers. Feel free to message me directly or email team (at) fightforthefuture (dot) org to get involved, and **[learn more here.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)**

**EDIT:** Oh hai, everyone! Very glad you're here. Lots of awesome brainstorming happening in the comments. Keep it coming. A lot of people are asking what sites will be doing on July 12. We're still encouraging brainstorming and creativity, but the basic idea is that sites will have a few options of things they can do to their homepage to show what the web would be like without net neutrality, ie a slow loading icon to show they are stuck in the slow lane, a ""site blocked"" message to show they could be censored, or an ""upgrade your Internet service to access this site"" fake paywall to show how we could be charged special fees to access content. Love all your ideas! Keep sharing, and **[go here for more info about the protest.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)**

**EDIT 2:** It's worth noting that given the current chairman of the FCC's political orientation, it's extra important that conservatives, libertarians, and others to the right of center speak out on this issue. The cable lobby is working super hard to turn this technological issue into a partisan circus. We can't let them. Net neutrality protects free speech, free markets, innovation, and economic opportunity. We need people and sites from all across the political spectrum to be part of this. ",2017-06-15 07:06:26

Regardless of your stance on the matter there should be no argument that internet usage amounts should be accurate and transparent to users affected by it. However that is not the case at all, there is no third party government agency in charge of regulating broadband metering. Comcast contracts out its metering to a third party vendor and its methods of measurement are internal and not open to the public at all. Just this year alone Comcast has received [thirteen thousand complaints about their data caps and their terrible accuracy in measurement](https://www.dslreports.com/shownews/The-FCC-Has-Received-13000-Complaints-About-Comcast-Data-Caps-135895).  Almost everyone who has to deal with this caps seems to have a story of their ISP charging them for data usage that would be impossible given their current bandwidth. 

**Discourages cord cutting and stifles competition:** 

Data caps exist solely as a consumer control measure to stifle competition and cause users to be biased against applications based on the data amount they use. For example [Netflix which lists high quality HD as using 3 GB per hour and Ultra HD as using 7gb per hour](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/87) is immediately affected by this. As Ultra HD becomes more common and using 7gb of data for an hour of video streaming becomes common place users affected by data caps will hit their limits more easily causing them to be charged overages. This will cause users to drop Netflix in favor of less data intensive services which Comcast will only be too happy to provide through cable. Families of five living in a home with heavy Netflix usage will already be pushing this current limit.

This isn't just for videos of course, people who use services like Steam will be hit just as hard especially as the size of games increases, data intensive services that would have otherwise been developed will languish on the vine as data caps cause consumers to be biased against them.  

**Users have little choice in what ISP they must subscribe to:**

The Internet is no longer a luxury that most can live without. For many it has become an essential utility much like electricity.

In any thread regarding complaints against Comcast or any ISP for that matter the main complaint of users is that they have no choice in their ISP (""Save us Google Fiber!""). Those lucky enough to live in major metropolitan areas may be fortunate enough to have the choice of maybe two or more ISPs but for many users the local ISP is the only choice they have which grants that business a monopoly in their area. In a happier world there would be dozens of ISPs each competing with each other and vying for market share so the poor behavior of one company only provides an opportunity for another to gain more customers. Sadly most Americans don't live in that kind of free economic environment. 


**What we need to do:**

How do consumers collectively fight this when they have little recourse in their choice of ISP?
The FCC is currently investigating data caps as a practice. If we as consumers just accept data caps the FCC will have less reason to crack down so it is imperative that the public puts pressure on the FCC. We're back to the Net Neutrality fight all over again as data caps are just a proxy issue that allows Comcast to achieve the same thing it wanted with its draconian net neutrality rules. 

Some users may be currently exempt from data caps but this behavior will absolutely roll down hill to other ISPs once they realize that consumers will accept it. Then you'll have to deal with your own little small town version of Comcast with little recourse. 

Much like the behavior of the last Net Neutrality fight calling the FCC directly has a huge impact. 

FCC Complaint Line:1-888-225-5322

[If you can't call directly you can file an online form to register your complaint.](https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=38824)

Like before we need to raise public awareness of this issue and flood the FCC with our complaints and input so we don't have to deal with a stifled internet. 

**EDIT 1:**
Some users have mentioned that the online forum and phone line isn't working out for them.
Another number that you can use to submit a comment or complaint.

FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler: (202) 418-1000

This was also a number we used to contact in order to urge Tom Wheeler to stand for Net Neutrality once again we can call and urge Mr. Wheeler to stand with the internet once again. However please remember that there are real people on the other side of the line. 



**EDIT 2:**

**If you so choose to give the office of Tom Wheeler((202) 418-1000) or the FCC complaint line(1-888-225-5322) a call here's a handy script you can use. Feel free to add on or improvise on this:**

""I'm calling FCC Chairman Wheeler to urge him to stand with Internet users and pass strong, loophole-free rules against so called Data Caps. There is no legitimate, technical reason for these data caps. Comcast itself [admitted](https://gizmodo.com/comcast-will-cap-more-peoples-data-because-of-fairness-1740913276) in [internal customer service guidelines that these caps aren’t about network congestion](https://i.imgur.com/quf68FC.jpg). Instead, it claims these data caps are about “fairness,” but the broadband industry continues to see higher revenues and profits with lower costs overall and there’s no argument that these caps are based on any “fair” costs that Internet usage causes. The real reason behind these caps is to protect Comcast’s monopoly over cable TV, making it more expensive for customers to “cut the cord” even if they want to choose other video options. And by exempting only its own online video application from the cap, Comcast gives Stream TV an advantage over all competing online video applications. ""

Replace Comcast with your own local ISP or ISPs in general. 

*Script and sources shamelessly lifted from [Battleforthenet](https://www.battleforthenet.com/?title-x-committees=1#top).


**EDIT 3:**

The key to this fight will sadly not be a single set of calls made to the FCC but rather a sustained campaign of public pressure and complaint. Long after this thread's karma decays and it falls off the pages people still need let their voices be heard. There will be more threads in the future to bring attention to this we wont go down without a fight.

Eight members of Congress that voted to kill broadband privacy are now leading the charge to kill Net Neutrality as well,70006,6e8wta,https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6e8wta/eight_members_of_congress_that_voted_to_kill/,2268,1496195113.0,"FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai is advancing a plan to kill net neutrality and let ISPs like Comcast and Verizon slow down or censor websites and apps. His plan would make the Internet slower and more expensive, and it would make censorship for profit the norm. 
 
We can stop this like we stopped SOPA, TPP, and ACTA. We just need to make it clear that Pai’s plan is **toxic** so that no one in Washington wants anything to do with it. 
 
Here’s what we can do. There are 8 members of Congress currently egging the FCC on and helping Pai gut net neutrality. They recently put their names on a [statement of support](https://energycommerce.house.gov/news-center/press-releases/bicameral-leaders-comment-pai-s-internet-regulations-announcement) or expressed their support in a [document of anti-net neutrality talking points](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3728775-GOP-Member-Toolkit-FCC-Open-Internet-Order-5-2017.html) to show that Pai has some congressional backing.  
 
They’re hoping we don’t notice and that they won’t face a backlash, so we need to call out these members of Congress now to make sure other members of Congress stay away. That way we can starve Pai of the congressional backing he needs to push through his plan.
 
Here are the 8 members of Congress that are publicly supporting Pai’s attack on net neutrality:
 
* Rep. Greg Walden (R-OR)  (Twitter: [@RepGregWalden](https://twitter.com/repgregwalden); phone: 202-225-6730)
* Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN)  (Twitter: [@MarshaBlackburn](https://twitter.com/MarshaBlackburn); phone: 202-225-2811)
* Sen. John Thune (R-SD)  (Twitter: [@johnthune](https://twitter.com/johnthune); phone: 202-224-2321)
* Sen. Roger Wicker (R-MS)  (Twitter: [@RogerWicker](https://twitter.com/rogerwicker); phone: 202-224-6253)
* Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) (Twitter: [@SpeakerRyan](https://twitter.com/speakerryan); phone: 202-225-3031)
* Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA)  (Twitter: [@CathyMcMorris](https://twitter.com/cathymcmorris); phone: 202-225-2006)
* Rep. Tom Graves (R-GA)  (Twitter: [@RepTomGraves](https://twitter.com/reptomgraves); phone: 202-225-5211)
* Rep. Bob Latta (R-OH)  (Twitter: [@BobLatta](https://twitter.com/boblatta); phone: 202-225-6405)
 
All of these representatives and senators voted for the recent broadband privacy repeal bill as well. (Note: Paul Ryan did not formally vote on the broadband privacy bill because, by custom, the Speaker of the House does not vote on legislation unless their vote would be decisive. But, as Speaker, Ryan was responsible for bringing the bill to the floor to be voted on.)
 
**Call their offices, tweet at them, post on their Facebook walls. Tell them you are appalled by their support for Ajit Pai’s plan to kill net neutrality and that you will do everything in your power to hold them accountable for destroying the Internet.** 
 
We can’t let these members of Congress get away with supporting Pai’s plan, or else other members of Congress will think it’s safe to support it as well. We know the cable lobbyists are trying their best to get everyone in Congress to support Pai’s plan. It’s up to us to stand up and make them think twice before they mess with the Internet.

EDIT: [u/pperca rightly points out](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6e8wta/eight_members_of_congress_that_voted_to_kill/di8hxda/) that another 8 senators have co-sponsored a bill that would repeal net neutrality. While their bill isn’t an explicit endorsement of Pai’s plan at the FCC, it’s basically a thinly veiled way of supporting Pai, so they deserve to be called out too.

The CLOUD Act would let cops get our data directly from big tech companies like Facebook without needing a warrant. Congress just snuck it into the must-pass omnibus package.,68091,867jo1,https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/867jo1/the_cloud_act_would_let_cops_get_our_data/,2642,1521708713.0,"Congress just attached the CLOUD Act to the 2,232 page, must-pass [omnibus package](http://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20180319/BILLS-115SAHR1625-RCP115-66.pdf). It's on page 2,201.

The so-called CLOUD Act would hand police departments in the U.S. and other countries new powers to directly collect data from tech companies instead of requiring them to first get a warrant. It would even let foreign governments wiretap inside the U.S. without having to comply with U.S. Wiretap Act restrictions.

Major tech companies like Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Oath are [supporting](https://blogs.microsoft.com/datalaw/wp-content/uploads/sites/149/2018/02/Tech-Companies-Letter-of-Support-for-Senate-CLOUD-Act-020618.pdf) the bill because it makes their lives easier by relinquishing their responsibility to protect their users’ data from cops. And they’ve been throwing their lobby power behind getting the CLOUD Act attached to the omnibus government spending bill. 

Read more about the CLOUD Act from EFF [here](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/03/new-backdoor-around-fourth-amendment-cloud-act) and [here](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/02/cloud-act-dangerous-expansion-police-snooping-cross-border-data), and the ACLU [here](https://www.aclu.org/blog/privacy-technology/internet-privacy/cloud-act-dangerous-piece-legislation) and [here](https://www.aclu.org/letter/coalition-letter-cloud-act).

There's certainly MANY other bad things in this omnibus package. But don't lose sight of this one. Passing the CLOUD Act would impact all of our privacy and would have serious implications.

I just came here recently to act as their pilot.. but have IT skills as well. The guy who set these pc's up didn't know how to prevent it, or set a metered connection. I am completely livid.

Comcast additionally slammed me with a $960 Termination Fee for closing my account.

"With the recent Chinese company, Tencent, in the news about investing in Reddit, and possible censorship, it's amazing to me how so many people don't realize Reddit is already one of the most heavily censored websites on the internet.",52418,apu3oz,https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/apu3oz/with_the_recent_chinese_company_tencent_in_the/,4616,1550012027.0,"I was looking through these recent /r/technology threads:

https://old.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/apcmtf/reddit_users_rally_against_chinese_censorship/

https://old.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/apgfu6/winnie_the_pooh_takes_over_reddit_due_to_chinese/

And it seems that there are a lot (probably most) of people completely clueless about the widespread censorship that already occurs on reddit. And in addition, they somehow think they'll be able to tell when censorship occurs! 


&#x200B;

I [wrote about this](https://old.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/apig51/rtheoryofreddit_mods_remove_thread_and_all/) in a few different subs recently, which you can find in my submission history, but here are some main takeaways:

* Over the past 5+ years Reddit has gone from being the best site for extensive information sharing and lengthy discussion, to being one of the most censored sites on the internet, with many subs regularly secretly removing more than 40% of the content. With the Tencent investment it simply seems like censorship is officially a part of Reddit's business model. 

* A small amount of random people/mods who ""got there first"" control most of reddit. They are accountable to no one, and everyone is subject to the whims of their often capricious, self-serving, and abusive behavior. 


* Most of reddit is censored completely secretly. By default there is no notification or reason given when any content is removed. Mod teams have to make an effort to notify users and cite rules. Many/most mods do not bother with this. This can extend to bans as well, which can be done silently via automod configs. Modlogs are private by default and mod teams have to make an effort to make them public. 

* Reddit finally released the mod guidelines after years of complaints, but the admins do not enforce them. Many mods publicly boast about this fact. 

* The tools to see when censorship happens are ceddit.com, removeddit.com, revddit.com ([more info](https://old.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/apu3oz/with_the_recent_chinese_company_tencent_in_the/eq83p0a/)), and using ""open in new private window"" for all your comments and submissions. You simply replace the ""reddit.com/r/w.e"" in the address to ceddit.com/r/w.e""

/r/undelete tracks things that were removed from the front page, but most censorship occurs well before a post makes it to the front page. 

There are a number of /r/RedditAlternatives that are trying to address the issues with reddit.

I set up my Raspberry Pi to automatically tweet at Comcast Xfinity whenever my internet speeds drop significantly below what I pay for,51357,43fi39,https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/43fi39/i_set_up_my_raspberry_pi_to_automatically_tweet/,3024,1454210817.0,"https://twitter.com/a_comcast_user

I pay for 150mbps down and 10mbps up. The raspberry pi runs a series of speedtests every hour and stores the data. Whenever the downspeed is below 50mbps the Pi uses a twitter API to send an automatic tweet to Comcast listing the speeds. 

I know some people might say I should not be complaining about 50mpbs down, but when they advertise 150 and I get 10-30 I am unsatisfied. I am aware that the Pi that I have is limited to ~100mbps on its Ethernet port (but seems to top out at 90) so when I get 90 I assume it is also higher and possibly up to 150.

Comcast has noticed and every time I tweet they will reply asking for my account number and address...usually hours after the speeds have returned to normal values. I have chosen not to provide them my account or address because I do not want to singled out as a customer; all their customers deserve the speeds they advertise, not just the ones who are able to call them out on their BS.

The Pi also runs a website server local to our network where with a graphing library I can [see the speeds over different periods of time](http://i.imgur.com/qdnnLzg.png).



EDIT: A lot of folks have pointed out that the results are possibly skewed by our own network usage. We do not torrent in our house; we use the network to mainly stream TV services and play PC and Xbone live games. I set the speedtest and graph portion of this up (without the tweeting part) earlier last year when the service was so constatly bad that Netflix wouldn't go above 480p and I would have >500ms latencies in CSGO. I service was constantly below 10mbps down. I only added the Twitter portion of it recently and yes, admittedly the service has been better.

Plenty of the drops were during hours when we were not home or everyone was asleep, and I  am able to download steam games or stream Netflix at 1080p and still have the speedtest registers its near its maximum of ~90mbps down, so when we gets speeds on the order of 10mpbs down and we are not heavily using the internet we know the problem is not on our end.

EDIT 2: People asked for the source code. PLEASE USE THE CLEANED UP CODE BELOW. I am by no means some fancy programmer so there is no need to point out that my code is ugly or could be better. http://pastebin.com/WMEh802V

"Net neutrality day of action update: Twitter, Soundcloud, and Medium, have joined.

The momentum is continuing to build. In the past few days Twitter, Soundcloud, Medium, Adblock, Twilio, and some other big names [have joined.](https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-06-22-net-neutrality-day-of-action-gets-another-huge/) Since we announced earlier this month a ton of other high-traffic sites have signed on including Imgur, Amazon, Namecheap, OK Cupid, Bittorrent, Mozilla, Kickstarter, Etsy, GitHub, Vimeo, Chess.com, Fark, Checkout.com, Y Combinator, and Private Internet Access. 

Reddit itself has also joined, [along with](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6g9pkl/reddit_lets_get_organized_more_than_30_subreddits/) more than 80 subreddits!

We've started solidifying ideas for the types of messages that sites can display on the day of the protest, and you can [check those out here](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12/#join) (feedback is welcome!) 

EDIT: A little more info about the plan: on July 12 websites will display a prominent message on their homepage, and apps and services will send push notifications or do whatever makes the most sense for them to reach as many people as possible. We'll direct people to [BattleForTheNet.com](https://www.battleforthenet.com), an optimized action site that easily allows anyone to submit a comment to the FCC and Congress at the same time, make a phone call, and sign up to participate in meetings with lawmakers. We'll also have video bumpers that YouTubers and other video creators can use. Basically, everyone should think about how they can use the power of the Internet to reach their audience with a message abotu net neutrality and make it easy for them to take action.

**Important context from my previous update below.**

Net neutrality is the basic principle that prevents Internet Service Providers like Comcast and Verizon from charging us extra fees to access the online content we want -- or throttling, blocking, and censoring websites and apps. Title II is the legal framework for net neutrality, and the FCC is trying to get rid of it, under immense pressure for the Cable lobby.

This day of action is an incredibly important moment for the Internet to come together -- across political lines -- and show that we don't want our Cable companies controlling what we can do online, or picking winners and losers when it comes to streaming services, games, and online content.

The current FCC chairman, Ajit Pai, is a former Verizon lawyer and seems intent on getting rid of net neutrality and misleading the public about it. But the FCC has to answer to Congress. If we can create another moment of massive online protest like the SOPA Blackout and the Internet Slowdown, we have a real chance of stopping the FCC in its tracks, and protecting the Internet as a free and open platform for creativity, innovation, and exchange of ideas. 

So! If you've got a website, blog, Tumblr, or any kind of social media following, or if you are a subreddit mod or active in an online community or forum, please get involved! There's so much we as redditors can do, from blacking out our sites to drive emails and phone calls to organizing in-person meetings with our lawmakers. Feel free to message me directly or email team (at) fightforthefuture (dot) org to get involved, and **[learn more here.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)**

**EDIT:** Oh hai, everyone! Very glad you're here. Lots of awesome brainstorming happening in the comments. Keep it coming. A lot of people are asking what sites will be doing on July 12. We're still encouraging brainstorming and creativity, but the basic idea is that sites will have a few options of things they can do to their homepage to show what the web would be like without net neutrality, ie a slow loading icon to show they are stuck in the slow lane, a ""site blocked"" message to show they could be censored, or an ""upgrade your Internet service to access this site"" fake paywall to show how we could be charged special fees to access content. Love all your ideas! Keep sharing, and **[go here for more info about the protest.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)**

**EDIT 2:** It's worth noting that given the current chairman of the FCC's political orientation, it's extra important that conservatives, libertarians, and others to the right of center speak out on this issue. The cable lobby is working super hard to turn this technological issue into a partisan circus. We can't let them. Net neutrality protects free speech, free markets, innovation, and economic opportunity. We need people and sites from all across the political spectrum to be part of this. ",2017-06-23 10:47:31

Comcast’s Corporate response to my recent Reddit front page post (“Comcast’s Notorious Unreturned Equipment Fees”) sends clear message: Comcast does not give a sh*t about customers – unless your story goes national.,44512,2duzfi,https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2duzfi/comcasts_corporate_response_to_my_recent_reddit/,2223,1408367026.0,"*Before I can even begin to justify the very charged title of this post, I beg of you to please bear with me and allow me to share the entire context of what has transpired.*

I am Dann Furia, OP of [Comcast’s Notorious Unreturned Equipment Fees]( http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2dibwq/in_order_to_avoid_comcasts_notorious_unreturned/) which made the top spot on Reddit’s front page four days ago, highlighting a common Comcast phenomenon: customers getting repeatedly billed for “Unreturned” equipment and other fees.

**The purpose of this post is two-fold:**

* Share my (previously untold on Reddit) entire Comcast story
* Address Comcast’s response to my recent front page Reddit post about Comcast’s fees


**Part I - MY ENTIRE COMCAST STORY**

**During the six month period from mid-January of 2014 through the end of July of 2014, I had to contact Comcast an astounding 25 times in regards to a multitude of issues, errors, and mistakes with my service, and charges related to my Comcast account.**  I kept careful, written records of my experiences as far back as January of this year, and by early July I had experienced such a stupefying range of problems with Comcast, that I additionally began recording my interactions with them.

During the above-referenced six month period, Comcast was a thoroughly disconcerting 0 for 25 in resolving anything.  Now, I completely understand that it may seem rather farfetched for me to claim that a single company (even one as notorious as Comcast) could fail the same customer 25 consecutive times, that is until you consider that I have previously documented at length each of [25 Consecutive Failed Comcast Interactions here in a four page Comcast blog] (http://www.dannfuria.com/comcast) spanning 6 months, 17 phone calls, 6 appointments, 2 online interactions, 20+ hours of my personal time, and $1320 in fees) and further that I possess months of paperwork, 50+ pages of documents, files, images, bills, screen shots, phone records, and roughly two hours of audio recordings, to support my claims.  While my four page Comcast blog may not be the most exhilarating read, the entirety of the account - the sum of its parts, if you will - is in my opinion a damning indictment of Comcast customer handling.  At a minimum, my four page Comcast blog provides another well documented account of a relentlessly awful brand of service.


**Part 2 - COMCAST’S RESPONSE TO MY FRONT PAGE REDDIT POST ABOUT COMCAST’S NOTORIOUS FEES**

As noted above, I tried in earnest 25 times in a six month period from January through July of 2014 to get Comcast to help me.  Comcast steadfastly ignored, neglected, dodged, and billed the crap out of me.  Put more poignantly, Comcast played an incredibly effective game of “Annoying you out of your money, wearing you down until you're too weak to complain, and then when you just can't go on, charge you for early cancellation. Or just make something up and put it on a bill and hope no one notices."" (Bill Maher, 7/25/14).

Then, *after* my [Comcast’s Notorious Unreturned Equipment Fees]( http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2dibwq/in_order_to_avoid_comcasts_notorious_unreturned/) post topped the Reddit front page four days ago and my story received national attention, Comcast’s Corporate office left me 5 messages in 18 hours.  I repeat - not a SINGLE Comcast employee could bother to help me one time in 6 months, despite my 25 well documented attempts to get help, and now all of the sudden Comcast has the ability to contact me 5 times in 18 hours?  That is interesting.

When I listened to the first voicemail from Comcast Corporate, I felt relieved that someone might actually finally help me.  But by the time I made my way through five consecutive Comcast Corporate messages (4 of them from the same person), and realized that they had all been delivered in an 18 hour period directly after my “Comcast fees” post went Reddit-viral, I literally began to feel sick to my stomach by Comcast’s response.  Now, I understand that when a Comcast customer story like mine starts to get national attention, Comcast probably tries to minimize whatever gripes might publicly emerge.  I also concede – flat out – a measure of hypocrisy on my part for reacting partly in anger that Comcast finally responded to me.  Having said that, there could not possibly be a more poignant, scathing illustration of the contrast between Comcast’s treatment of a regular customer (contemptuously disregarded 25 times in 6 months) and a “Special / Going Public” customer (5 Corporate messages in 18 hours).

All indications are that Comcast has just now (as of about 3 days ago) taken notice of a customer - who for several years has resided in their backyard, the suburbs of Philadelphia – and begun to address but one of many unfortunate aspects of my Comcast experience (the $1320 in fees aspect).  I, meanwhile, have had 7 months to bake in the rancor of Comcast Purgatory, a dimension from which very few, if any, escape.  So please allow me, indulge me if you would be so kind, to summarize how this feels from my perspective:  In a six month period this year, Comcast mishandled my account 25 times in a row, put me on hold on the phone for several hours, failed to show up to multiple appointments, hung up on me while I was on hold, fed me a torrent of misinformation (much of which is recorded on audio, mine and theirs), threatened me with and then auto-generated to my account a Literally-Unremovable $960 Termination Fee, repeatedly billed me $360 for properly returning my equipment, and wasted way more than 20 hours of my time.

Comcast’s effective response in helping me during the six month time frame? Zero. Zilch. None. Null. Devoid.
Comcast’s response when I cancelled my account?  They buried me $1320 in fees.
Comcast’s response when I went public to complain?  Their Corporate office immediately contacted me 5 times in 18 hours.

**And so this appears to be the standard for receiving attention from a Comcast representative who actually has the ability or power to address problems that Comcast has caused a customer:** First, a customer should suffer through months of negligence and poor treatment, documenting each step of the journey while firmly battling a motley assortment of heinous fees, then after 6 months utterly give up all hope and feel like a fool for bothering to try so hard to get Comcast to help you, then – if you can manage to find the time - write a [4 page blog about your Comcast experience](http://www.dannfuria.com/comcast), then [share part of your story with Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2dibwq/in_order_to_avoid_comcasts_notorious_unreturned/), be fortunate enough to receive incredible & overwhelming support that vaults your post to the Reddit front page, and gain some national coverage (from The Verge, Gawker, & International Business Times).  Perhaps then - and only then - can a customer get Comcast to clean up a mess they’ve created.

It appears, for the time being, that I might just escape from Comcastic Purgatory.  

But believe me when I say this with heartfelt sincerity: I feel genuinely sorry for the rest of you poor souls.",2014-08-18 21:03:46

[Here's a screencapture for cellphone data plans in México](http://imgur.com/yYobj7x), which show how carriers basically discriminate data use based on which social network you browse/consume.

I wanted to post this here because I keep finding all these mockups about how Net Neutrality ""might look"" which -albeit correct in it's assumptions- get wrong the business model end of what companies would do with their power.

Basically, what the mockups show... a world where ""regular price for top companies vs pay an extra if you're a small company"", non-net neutral competition in México is actually based on who gives away more ""free app time"". Eg: ""You can order 3 Uber rides for free, no data use, with us!""

Which I guess makes more sense. The point is still the same though... ISPs are looking inside your data packets to make these content discrimination decisions.

You'll have to pay extra to stream at 720p again. 
If you pay for UNLIMITED: You now get throttled after 20 gigs, and devices connected to your mobile hotspot cannot exceed 600kbps. If you're paying the gig though, you still get 4G speeds, ironic moneygrab.



Straight from an email I received today:

Update on cellular video resolution and personal hotspots
We wanted to let you know about two changes to your Xfinity Mobile service that'll go into effect in the coming weeks.

Video resolution

To help you conserve data, we've established 480p as the standard resolution for streaming video through cellular data. This can help you save money if you pay By the Gig and take longer to reach the 20 GB threshold if you have the Unlimited data option. 

Later this year, 720p video over cellular data will be available as a fee-based option with your service. In the meantime, you can request it on an interim basis at no charge. Learn more

This update only affects video streaming over cellular data. You can continue to stream HD-quality video over WiFi, including at millions of Xfinity WiFi hotspots.

Personal hotspots

If you have the Unlimited data option, your speeds on any device connected to a personal hotspot will not exceed 600 Kbps. At this speed, you'll conserve data so that it takes longer to reach the 20 GB threshold but you'll still be able to do many of the online activities you enjoy.

Want faster speeds when using a personal hotspot? The By the Gig data option will continue to deliver 4G speeds for all data traffic.",2018-07-02 17:32:32

They can do what they want, since I have no other options. http://youtu.be/PRLgG9ctZGg
[](http://youtu.be/PRLgG9ctZGg)

EDIT: I'm glad this is getting some attention. Last night I sent the video to We_Can_Help@cable.comcast.com and
ecare@comcast.com , as well as the tips address for the Consumerist. Today I submitted an FCC complaint per the suggestion of /u/BarbwireCake. I've only received an automated response from Comcast so far. Some are suggesting that a class action lawsuit might be a catalyst for change; I'm not sure. I will update when I hear from someone.

EDIT:
I spoke with someone from Comcast Executive Customer Relations. He wanted to discuss my complaint, but refused to be recorded. I record all of my calls with creditors so that I won't be promised something that is never delivered. As I found out yesterday, it might not even matter if the call has been recorded. Luckily this thread got some attention today, so I might actually get help with this issue. He assured me that I would change my mind about Comcast after speaking with him but I declined to continue the conversation. I've obviously learned my lesson today about keeping accurate records, and I don't want to hear anymore crocodile tears or pseudo-promises.
In any case, he said he would email me details of our non-conversation, which I will place here:

--
Hello /u/sweetlethargy, I regret not being able to consent to your recording our conversation due to  the nature of the reasons or possible intent that you may have for the recording. In reviewing the original and unedited version of your initial call, the agent gave you correct information on the service plan and promotional services at the time of the call. This is the product and service that you spoke about:

Internet Plus 09/06 - 10/05 69.95

Includes Limited Basic, HBO, Streampix, a
Standard Definition Digital Converter and
Remote For The Primary Outlet, and
Performance Internet.

Service Discount -19.96

Total XFINITY TV $49.99 plus taxes and fees

Franchise Fee 1.42

Utility Tax 2.00

PEG Access Support 0.28

State Sales Tax 0.16

FCC User Fee 0.09

Total Taxes, Surcharges & Fees $3.95 (these vary slightly per month and are only collected by Comcast)
 
Docsis 3 Owned Mdm 09/06 - 10/05 0.00

Blast! Internet Svc 09/06 - 10/05 11.00

Service Discount -11.00

Total XFINITY Internet $0.00 (this was added after your conversation with the agent as a bonus) which may have caused this confusion

We have extended this promotional offer as a gesture of good will for an additional 12 months as long as you understand that at the end of that term if you wish to keep it, it will be billed at its standard rate.
--

It seems that they aren't accepting responsibility for anything, but they are offering me something. Here is my response. (All I want is what I was quoted):

--
Bottom line: do I have 100mbps down, 25mbps up, no contract, at $53.85 total per month including taxes and all other fees for 12 months?
--

Im waiting for a response.

For people who were asking, I used the android app Automatic Call Recorder by Appliqato. Everyone should record conversations with their creditors to keep them accountable.
(18:24PST)

**FINAL UPDATE:**

Just spoke with an ""Executive Customer Relations Supervisor"" who apologized for the actions of the two customer retention reps, as well as the Executive Customer Relations rep who refused to be recorded yesterday. She was very polite, took full responsibility for Comcast's mistakes, and allowed me to record our conversation. She explained that ""both representatives you reached were freshly out of a training class"" and they ""should've placed you on hold"" to get more information. This is strange, since I could clearly hear the second rep being coached on what to say... 

In any case, the Executive Customer Relations Supervisor said she would credit me a month of service as a sign of good will. She also explained that I would be receiving the promotional rate through August 15th 2015, however, due to the fluctuation of taxes and fees, she could not guarantee my final cost of $53.85. This month the final cost would be $55.55, for example. I indicated that all I wanted was the out-the-door $53.85 cost that I was quoted in August. I agree that the dollar amount is negligable, but all I've wanted is the price I was quoted when I agreed to keep the service. She agreed to credit my account $5 every month so that at no time I would be expected to pay more than $53.85.

Today I Learned that if Comcast pushes you around, the best course of action is to expose them on social media. I can honestly say that this has been easier, less time consuming, and less stressful to make and post the video than it would've been to dial 1-800-COMCAST again. I hope these Comcast horror stories continue to get posted so that something might change one day. Proper competition is the only answer to this solution, and I personally feel that public utilies should also operate as ISPs.

Everyone should be recording their interactions with creditors, as it is obviously the only way to keep them (somewhat) honest. It's sad that I was granted my simple request only after my video had been posted to the Consumerist, Techdirt, BGR, Gawker, yahoo, etc, etc... I realize that most people will simply never receive help with their complaints.

Good luck to all of you who are dealing with similar situations.

**tldr; I'm now getting what I was quoted: 100mbps down, 25mbps up, through August 15th, no contract, for no more than $53.85 per month.**
