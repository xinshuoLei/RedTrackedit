Moderator Post: Impeachment-related questions and why they are not appropriate for this sub -aka- Heck no we're not touching that hot potato,893,dcwhgr,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dcwhgr/moderator_post_impeachmentrelated_questions_and/,94,1570162591.0,"Hey all, 

We get a lot of posts relating to breaking news, and the ongoing impeachment inquiry in the United States is no exception. This is obviously a big story that deals with the law, and we know you have questions. After discussion among the mod team, we have decided that **we will not allow impeachment related posts in this sub right now**; they will be removed without further explanation.

We are doing this for several reasons. First, impeachment is a political and legislative process that takes place in the court of public opinion and behind closed doors in Congress. While it is a process based on constitutional and statutory law (indeed some parts may be litigated before the House votes or the Senate sits in trial); it will be a quasi-legal procedure where the outcome is as much determined by political considerations as the letter of the law. In short, it will never end up being tried before a court, so it is out of our wheelhouse.

In addition, it's impossible for anyone to provide answers to most questions. Impeachment is a sui generis process and there is very little law on which to base answers. Everything that is happening right now is taking place in a grey area, which our devoted readers will recognize is not unusual. What is _very unusual_ is that it is a grey area nearly devoid of statutory and case law borders. Anyone who claims to know for sure what will happen is lying - it’s all wishes, guesses, dowsing, and witchcraft at this point. The discussions in here would be speculative at best and argumentative at worst. /r/Legaladvice is not a forum for arguments about politics; there are plenty of places on Reddit and elsewhere to do that.

The mods agree there are fascinating legal issues here. There will likely be several Supreme Court and Court of Appeals cases that spring from this process like Athena from Zeus' forehead. If and when there is useful and interesting discussion to be had or information to be disseminated, we may open megathreads. For those few impeachment-related legal questions that likely have definite answers* we encourage you to post them in /r/legaladviceofftopic. Even there, however, the moderators will remove all but the most benign and germane. 

We value your contributions and input greatly. At present, however, we believe this sub has nothing to offer that isn't provided by other more politically focused forums**. Thank you for understanding this position, and we invite you to comment below with any questions, concerns, or just pics of your pets. 

-The moderators of r/legaladvice.

After several months of back and forth with only small increases in the offer from Geico, I finally accepted their settlement, and promptly turned around and sued the other driver in Small Claims Court for the difference. Geico told the other driver that their duties of subrogation had been met and he was on his own for this, so he showed up with his own lawyer for the initial hearing. The day after the hearing, that lawyer then contacted Geico, seemingly disputed their stance on subrogation, and then Geico contacted me with a settlement offer of the amount for which I was suing.

So in the end, Geico paid me the total replacement value of the vehicle as I saw it.",7266
HELP- my autistic son’s behavioral therapist called CPS over turmeric. Not kidding.,4316,dq1j6n,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dq1j6n/help_my_autistic_sons_behavioral_therapist_called/,107,1572626670.0,"EDIT: thank you all so much for your feedback. The irony in all of this is that I am a mandated reporter as well which, in a sense, has made me more concerned. Alas, I’m trudging forward with abandon and will be kind and cooperative. I’ll be sure to post updates. 


I am in California. I need help and I’m hoping that some of you may have some insight. 
My autistic  6 year old has been with the same ABA (behavioral therapy) company for 4 years and we love them. Several weeks ago, we got a new behavioral therapist who is with my son 4 days a week, 2 of them at our home. I have not been happy with her as she rubbed me the wrong way from the start: harsher that necessary with my son and overall cold and calloused. I spoke to our BCBA (supervisor) and she said the therapist was brand new to the company and that they’d give her further training. 

Today, I get a phone call from our BCBA who tells me that CPS was called over a concern that there was a bottle of supplements (turmeric, to be specific) on the counter that my son allegedly picked up and it concerned her. The therapist never said anything to me about this.  Our BCBA then says that she herself has been to our home many times and is here to back me up in anyway needed and that she has never been concerned about anything in our home. 

Questions: 

1. should I obtain legal council or just move forward and willingly work with CPS knowing that there is no case?  My thought is that this is something frivolous and clearly not neglect, but I honestly have no idea what to expect with this process and want to do what’s best for my family. 

2. If I do decide to move forward sans attorney, do I allow them in when they visit? 

3. How much (or little) information do I give during the home visit? 

Any feedback would be much appreciated. This is brand new territory for me and, quite frankly, I’m terrified even though I know that I’m a damn good special needs mother.

*For the comments regarding tumeric: I take it for the anti-inflammatory properties and it helps drastically with my psoriatic arthritis.",4316
[Update][WI] Local official awards himself contracts,865,dq5li8,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dq5li8/updatewi_local_official_awards_himself_contracts/,1,1572650197.0,"Update to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9nq3zs/wi_local_official_awards_himself_contracts/)

I went back and forth for a couple months on how to best get the ball rolling on having someone investigate the town chairman. Considering how difficult it had been to get records from the chairman, I decided to just run against him in the spring election. Including the chairman, three of the five board seats were up for election. With the help of some neighbors, we put together a little “campaign” flyer and mailed it out to everyone in the town. It seems the old board wasn’t all that popular, and all the incumbents including the chairman lost their re-election bids by a significant margin.

As the new chairman and armed with the keys to the town hall, I gathered all the relevant documents and handed them over to the DA’s office. They were pretty interested and investigated for a few weeks, but ultimately they told me that even though they thought the whole thing was shady, too much of it hinged on whether the former chairman had criminal intent. They said it came down to a question of whether or not the town just kept really awful records of discussions, voting, and recusal when considering contracts with the chairman. Part of their reluctance I think was that he had already been voted out of office.

Mostly I’m just glad the guy is gone. Unfortunately I’ve been busy since getting elected since the town records weren’t the only thing that got sloppy while the other guy was in charge. Also it turns out that local government positions are pretty thankless, but someone has to do it I guess. And I’m not a crook so that’s a plus.",865

Neighbor A is an 86-year-old , questionably independently living woman, with no family or roommates that has liived in the neighborhood for more than 25 years. Neighbor B is a 50 something-year-old couple who just recently moved next door within the last 5 years. We live in a neighborhood controlled by a HOA. Neighbor B is bat shit crazy, legally speaking, and is constantly arguing with people who walk by (we live on a popular sidewalk) with a megaphone. She puts tape around the sidewalk in front of her house too(something she has been fined for). Her lastest power trip was to purchase a giant super bright LED light thing that she set up on her porch to shine directly into Neighbor As bedroom window. Neighbor A came to me (because I usually help her with chores, errands, and just check on her to make sure she is okay) and said she can't sleep at night and explained what was happening. She believes it was over a lawn dispute. 
I contacted the HOA who already knew about the situation because OTHER neighbors were complaining about the light ( it's one of those like 300$ box lights, visible from across the whole neighborhood). The problem is there is no rule they can hit her with. I have tried to not have to resort to police being involved. But is there some type of harassment law she is breaking?

[CANADA] I am (close to) a slave and don’t see a way out.,47,dq93xl,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dq93xl/canada_i_am_close_to_a_slave_and_dont_see_a_way/,10,1572665580.0,"Hello folks, 
I’m seeking help with my situation.

Me and my wife moved to Canada on last November. We had been here before (2017) and met a business owner in Richmond, let’s call him Fred.

Fred has a company with his dad (John) and when we met I told him I would love to move to Canada but would need a job offer.
He said that he could do a deal with me, he would do my LMIA and I would have to work for some time for him after I get my PR and I would have to pay the LMIA and Pr fees.
I agreed and we moved to Canada on November 2018 and that’s where the nightmare begun.

On my LMIA it’s stated that Ill be working 37,5 hours a week in a office for 23,50/hour (it’s an office position). 

When I started my job his dad was VERY RUDE with me all the time, literally he was the most disgusting and disrespectful person I ever met, insulting me all the times and making my job 1000 times harder.
I tried my best to not feel bad every day for working there but it was quite impossible. On top of that he said that my wage was going to be $15/hour and not $23.50 and he would discount from my paycheque the difference, with all the discounts at the end of the month I receive about $9.00/ hour which is not only below the minimum wage but also extremely low for any kind of paycheque.

Whenever they are talking to me they are irreducible, always saying that if I don’t agree I should go back to my country.
During this last year they removed me from the office saying that his dad wasn’t liking my work but as they are nice guys they were going to put me in another sector.
The sector they put me is installation so I am working as a labourer. They don’t pay any benefit or anything more for overtime, they don’t give any protection equipment, sometimes we don’t have lunch time, sometimes I work 15 hours in a day, sometimes I have to travel to Vancouver island and they don’t give any penny extra for that, last week we got stuck in the island because the ferries were cancelled and he discounted the time we were sleeping from the paycheque.

I asked him for a raise and he said that he already helps me too much and for me to stop pushing him.

Because I get paid so low I can’t save money to pay the pr fees and I can’t leave the company or I lose my LMIA and have to go back to my country.

It’s been quite a nightmare living here and I’m only enduring because I think better days are coming but I’ve reached a point that I literally don’t wanna wake up anymore, I just feel suffocated all the time and this has been the worst I ever passed in my life.

Is there anything I can do? 
Please, if you can, help me find a way.",47
Husbands ex-gf trying to change child’s name.,15,dqd7ik,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dqd7ik/husbands_exgf_trying_to_change_childs_name/,2,1572684325.0,"So, my husband has a child from a previous relationship. 

We have the child every weekend and half the holidays. He pays a set amount to her weekly even though we have the child as often as we do.  This is a private agreement and has been since the child was a baby and they were no longer a couple. In no way is the maintenance grudged either. 

My husbands ex is getting married and has told the child they will have to change their name to her soon to be husbands name to be the same as the rest of the family and that all the legal paperwork is done. 

My husband is on the child’s birth certificate and he has to give permission for them to do that. Which he has not given. He doesn’t want the child to change their name. The child currently has the mother’s surname. 
The child is proud of their surname and wants to keep it but is feeling pressured and stressed about being forced to change it. The child is under 10. 
If anything the child should have the option of changing it to my husbands surname but seemingly that’s not allowed. 
I personally don’t think it’s appropriate for the child to be forced to change their name just because the mother is getting married. I also have a child from a previous relationship and they are still named their fathers surname and their father has nothing to do with them. 

The child has expressed to me that they want to live with us but I doubt my husbands ex would allow it. I have told my husband this and he doesn’t know what to do. The child’s mother has been quite manipulative over the years and used to use the child to her advantage. 

Any advice would be appreciated.",15

I called the ambulance company because I saw it went to collections (I moved recently so didn't receive the letters) and they said my insurance said they sent 3 checks totaling over 3k to my address on file (my parent's address) and the checks were made out to the subscriber (my stepdad). The letters with the checks stated what and who it was for.

He definitely pocketed the money. My parents aren't responding to my messages. I am SO upset. I'm literally hospitalized right now and I feel so helpless and drowning in medical debt and they know how hard things are for me... and they took my money.

I informed the insurance company and they said since the checks were addressed to him there is nothing they can do.

A coworker of mine was involved in an accident and hasn’t been the same since. He has/had a huge lawsuit against the company I work for because of this accident.

One day I’m working with him, and he randomly begins to tell me that he’s going to kill me. That it’ll take a couple months before what he does to me, kills me. He says it multiple times, in front of my foreman as well. Occasionally adding that he would kill another coworker of mine first, and I’ll be able to witness that death first before I die.

I tell my foreman that I’m scared and I don’t know how to take this. He tells me “he probably forgot to take his meds, he will forget about this tomorrow”. We get back to our shop and he says it again, I confront him, frustrated. Just verbal, asking him why he’s saying these things. He has no response and my foreman tells me to take a walk. 

I bring it up to my managers, and an investigation status, foreman claims to write a statement. I saw it, 5 lines long, he “forgot” the rest. 

The guy is let off.

He then calls inspector general tells them A bunch of lies about me, and the other guy he mentioned. Also a bunch about other people he’s has issues with. Now I’m under investigation for being a drug dealer.  No one at work trusts me anymore, barely talk to me. I’m alienated, and the call to the ig opened up investigations against so many other coworkers and it’s all being blamed on me having brought told the managers that this guy wanted to kill me.

I have also never received anything regarding this claim, including any hits to my credit which I monitor frequently. The whole thing is so bizarre. It almost feels like this collection agency was waiting until the maximum amount of time had passed (nearly 10 years) in order to collect as much interest as possible. That's pure speculation on my part however, since they haven't given me a dollar amount. I will be filing a motion to vacate as soon as possible. I'm hoping the clock started ticking when they sent me the notarized letter with the court case information, rather than the original phone call from several months ago.

Original post:

As the title says, I live in Alaska. I was, briefly, in California in 2008. That summer I was in a bike crash, a truck ran me off the road on my way to work and they never found the guy. I was taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital. I had insurance, and it paid most of my bills. I paid the remainder that I owed to the hospital, but never received anything from the ambulance service (which was the local FD).

Fast forward to three months ago when out of blue I receive a phone call from a collection agency. I think it's a hoax or fraud or something, and I tell them as much. They claim that they have a default judgement against me from 2010. I scoff and say I moved from California to Alaska in September of 2008. I ask how they served me notice of the court case. They list off my old address from California--where I did not live at the time of the supposed service. I tell them that even if there is a real court judgment (which I doubt), it was clearly fraudulently obtained. At no point do they tell me how much they think I owe or how I might pay them.

A week ago I received a non-certified letter with a supposed copy of the court judgement (still no dollar amounts on it though). I tried looking up the court case online and found nothing.

Today they attempted to levy my bank account. Thankfully it just so happened that there wasn't much in there as my wife is an accountant and had moved things around recently. Weirdly the sheriff's department that attempted the levy is in a different county than the court judgement.

They told her to stay off it for a few days and then only limited use until it got better. Because she has a standing job, We dropped a doctor's note off with her supervisor and got the OK for her to stay home, using sick time, for the remaining 3 days of that week.

She went back to work Monday the 21st, with an air cast (really just a removable brace), and tried to limit her standing. Due to her job, she wasn't able to sit nearly enough and her ankle just stopped getting any better. So a week and a half later, she went to her primary doctor (Oct 30), and her primary doctor sent another note to her supervisor stating that she will need a modified work plan to allow her ankle to heal. Now her supervisor wants to get HR involved (That's fine) but HR is on vacation until mid week next week, so her supervisor want's her to talk to her supervisors boss, AKA bigger boss, but the bigger boss wants to call the doctor for clarification. We feel they everything they need to know outlined in the two notes they have gotten from two different doctors.

Debt collector doesn't understand a request to validate debt. Time to get a lawyer? [IN-US],46,dq42rb,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dq42rb/debt_collector_doesnt_understand_a_request_to/,18,1572642887.0,"Hi all -

I previously had service with Comcast which included TV, Internet, and Home Alarm. When we moved out of that house, I called Comcast and tried to transfer the service. At that point they realized that they could not transfer the service because I would be out of their service area. So I was allowed to cancel the TV, Internet, and Alarm service without an ETF. You should also know that all of my Comcast payments were setup for autopay and were never late. I am 100% sure that I don't owe Comcast a single penny.

It's been over a year since I canceled this service. About 8 months ago I started getting calls from ERC (a debt collector). I followed the process and requested verification/validation of the debt. A couple weeks later I received a letter in the mail from ERC stating that the debt could not be verified and that they were no longer going to pursue it.

Today I got a new call from a company called Southwest Credit Systems. They're now trying to collect on the same debt. So, again, I tried to follow the process and explained that they need to A.) Validate the debt and send me correspondence via the US Mail, and B.) Stop calling me until that's been done.

The agent on the phone didn't seem familiar with this and transferred me to her supervisor. I spoke to him for a minute and he also didn't seem to understand my legal rights. He said that Southwest Credit Systems was going to send me a letter today, but the best he could do was to send me the ""last statement"" from comcast. I told him that I need them to provide all details of the debt and its history via mail, and I also explained that this debt was previously attempted to be collected by ERC. 

Both the agent and the supervisor wrapped up the conversation with ""Thank you for allowing Comcast to serve you"". Is this a shitty attempt by COMCAST to collect an invalid debt now?!

I suppose I'll wait for whatever they're going to try and send me in the mail, and then I'll respond with a certified letter requesting the debt be validated, but I'm seeing red flags already that they're not collecting correctly. 

As of right now, there's not any marks on my credit report. If they fail to validate the debt and continue to try and collect this debt, is there much of a point in going after them or should I just ignore them? The invalid debt is somewhere between $250-$288 depending upon who you talk to and what day of the week it is. (Which I'm pretty sure is also illegal)

I send my rent to my landlord via e-transfer every month and have done so for a couple of years. Each month I send him my rent and a separate e-mail telling him what the password for the transfer is. This month, his e-mail was compromised and someone else cashed my e-transfer.

He believes I still owe him rent and that the responsibility for this falls on me.

I've spoken with my bank and they are opening an investigation. I've spoken to the police and filed a report and they will be calling me back at some point tomorrow. I'm obviously going to pursue this as far as I can, but I guess my big question is - am I still on the hook for rent if it went to his e-mail and was deposited from there? He's saying that because it never hit his bank account, it's a theft from me rather than a theft from him.

The biggest problem:  we need spot coverage in our stores from time to time.  Adding an associate not coded to a specific location for a shift here and there severely throws off these calculations as AVG sales per associate is not weighted against coded employees and spot employees.  The KPI difference is something to the tune of 10000$.

Cancelling a contract for services not rendered,6,dqbwxo,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dqbwxo/cancelling_a_contract_for_services_not_rendered/,3,1572678032.0,"Boston, Massachusetts US

Will try to keep this brief and to the point.

Did a deal with a personal trainer employed by a fitness company at the start of October. Basically paid for 8 sessions for the month, on an 8 month commit.

After 4 sessions, our trainer disappeared for a few days. We got an email from the company that a new trainer was being assigned to our apartment complex, and that our original trainer had left the company. That Sunday we got an initial email from a 'trainer', then a follow up to say they were just the scheduler, and that the trainer would be in touch.

The following day the trainer got in touch, and a brief back-and-forth told us that he couldn't fulfill the times and dates we had committed to, but that he'd let us know his availability.

Never heard from him again.

Following that, we got a message from our old trainer, and met up with him - he gave us a free training session, to honor what had been agreed, and told us that he had been a business partner of the owner, who then decided to eject him from the business when he asked for more favorable terms. Apparently most of the trainers in the area also decided to leave when this all went down, and go work with our guy. Go figure.

Either way, we'd paid a significant amount up front to this company and had only received 50% of what we'd paid for. Clearly they're losing trainers, and can't satisfy demand.

So today I cancelled via email, claiming services not rendered. I pointed out that 50% of the agreed sessions had not been given despite our attempts, but that I would not be seeking a refund, merely termination of any future relationship.

Their CEO responded claiming this and that, but ultimately saying that they would honor the sessions we had left (giving the wrong number of what was left in the process) and that I had no right to cancel due to their T&Cs.

I don't believe that they apply here. He's claiming Item 6, however we *tried* to schedule sessions and were told none were available with zero follow-up.

I think I'm in the right here, but still have that 10% that isn't sure.

**Am I in the clear to cancel this based on services not rendered ?**

T&Cs are as follows:

Next week before Saturday I ask if we can go, and they say they're busy that day, although they said this at one in the afternoon and they really didn't do anything important for the rest of the day, AFAIK

I tell them over and over that I just want to get my stuff, so my worker has to come in and promise we'll go next week on Tuesday (this week). That was great, until we booked an eye appointment on that say day after school.

OK great, they moved it to today, Friday. Yesterday on Thursday my foster parent ""reminded"" me late at night that my boxes should be ready for tomorrow and were supposed to be packed in her car.

I never remember being told this, but I replied that I would fix up the boxes in the morning before school starts.

Morning comes around, I woke up 20m earlier than usual, brought two out of five of the folded boxes upstairs in my room to downstairs near the door. I assumed she wanted me to store these boxes in her car, but her car was (obviously) locked and I didn't want to wake her up or annoy her in the morning. Had I brought all five folded boxes downstairs, prepped them, and put them in her car I'd be late for school (and I'm a good boy so I don't want to be late)

I get to school on time and text her that I brought my two boxes downstairs (because I didn't plan on getting anymore than two boxes worth of stuff besides my PC, which wouldn't possibly fit in the box and I didn't trust it to be in one). She gets very upset and tells me it was extremely irresponsible on my part, then creates a three-way text convo between me, her, and the case worker (that she said she didn't have her number).

The case worker says

""Name,
We are unable to get your belongings today as you did not prepare. You need to make sure we have a lot of boxes to pack up your things. Also make sure on the day we plan to go next that someone at the house knows we are coming.""

First off I explained myself, second off I can not contact the person at the house because I don't have their information.

I have suggested before that a friend could simply go to my old home and get my belongings, then bring them to my foster home and they denied this suggestion.

I have an adult friend who has asked for my workers number. They want permission to pick me up, drive me around and do stuff.

The bathroom cabinet under the sink was made of cheap, flimsy wood (or something like wood).

After three years of completely normal bathroom use, the cabinet doors under the sink became damaged/warped from contact with water. My super (who has always been over-the-top rude to me and my roommate) told us that we'd have to pay for the damages. My roommate and I knew it was absolute BS...there was literally *nothing* we could have done to prevent the ""damage"" besides not using our bathroom sink.

After a *month* of waiting (which is illegal in NYC), we got our deposit back with $460 removed from it for the cabinet. We were going to let it slide if it was like a hundred bucks or something, but $460 is an absolute joke to replace two cheap doors.

Do I have any room for recourse? It's not my fault they used shitty cabinets in a bathroom that literally melt if they touch water. Nothing could have prevented this, so we are considering taking them to small claims court.

[Florida] My friends are shoplifting without me knowing. How can I legally protect myself in the event that they're caught and I'm with them?,14,dq762x,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dq762x/florida_my_friends_are_shoplifting_without_me/,20,1572656990.0,"Hi,

The title is largely self explanatory, but more details can help. When I've gone to stores with them, they're being petty thieves without me noticing. I only see it when we've left and they say ""I took X"" (usually something like a snack, but the largest item has been maybe 50$).

 I don't want to argue the ethics of what they're doing because to be honest I can only control myself. But I'm nervous that I'll be with them and either:

**A**: I won't realize that they stole something, they're caught, and I'm forced to either dip and pretend I had no association, or be questioned myself, potentially getting charged.

**B**: They'll steal in front of me, putting me in an even worse position because if they're caught then, I'm an accomplice.

So what would the process look like if either of the above happens?

I don't steal things myself, and I obviously don't want a record, especially since I'm currently applying to universities. I've talked to them about it before, but they're stubborn and confident they won't get caught. So I want to learn what I should do in the worst case scenario

First, my husband had a DUI 4ish years ago. It was an isolated incident. Will this make it impossible for us to adopt/be granted guardianship?

Second, (third, fourth,...), we are not rolling in money. How much does adoption generally cost? Would it be advisable to go the guardianship route instead? If so, how invasive is the state regarding home visits?

Kicked Off My Cattle Lease,17,dq4bit,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dq4bit/kicked_off_my_cattle_lease/,3,1572644143.0,"Hello All - So I lease a piece of property in Texas that is less than \~100 acres for cattle.  I live in a small, rural community where people know and are known to everyone else, with longstanding connections to each other.  

My Uncle owned this piece of property up until about 1/2 a year ago.  At that time, he sold it to a neighbor who is a banker and longstanding neighbor.  The banker told my uncle he would honor the terms of the lease if the sale went through and therefore allow me to continue to keep my cattle there for the duration of the lease.  I have an email from my uncle in which he at least refers to this verbal agreement with the banker.  This was important to me because the land was involved in a government program that required me to keep a long term lease on the land.  It is valued at about $17/acre a year for three years.  So about 1500/year for three years.    

At first, everything seemed fine.  Then a couple of months ago he wrote to me that he wanted to raise the lease payments from $5/acre to $15/acre even though the property is not worth that!  I thought this was a breach of his verbal agreement, and not only that I went back and read the written lease that I had in place with my uncle.  It turns out, the lease included an ""heirs and assigns"" clause.  Therefore, I contacted my lawyer who carefully checked the language of the lease and confirmed that the lease is on my side at least until December 2021.  According to my lawyer, he is bound to the original terms of the lease, including the lease payment rate.  However, in the end I decided to pay the $15/acre to keep the lease, because with the government program I could continue to break even on the lease payment.  However, I just received an email from him notifying me that our goals for the land are ""materially different"" and that he wants me to vacate the land.  I have been nothing but courteous to him in my communications, and have asked him numerous times to communicate me his goals and desires for his land, etc, etc, etc.

This really irks me.  One, he broke his word to my uncle.  Two, he is violating the terms of the lease.  And Three, I have already bent over backwards to work with him and be a good neighbor.  

Now, my question is just about what my legal outcomes would be as I think about strategy here.  Can I sue him for damages related to the loss of the lease?  Or would my suit simply force him to keep me as a tenant (this is a bad outcome, for obvious reasons)? 

Thanks all for your advice.",17

Aunt is suspected of theft from Grandfather's estate,3,dqajvm,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dqajvm/aunt_is_suspected_of_theft_from_grandfathers/,4,1572671810.0,"My Aunt/Godmother is my mom's only (and older) sibling. They lost their parents last year. Towards the end of my grandparents' life, my Aunt was caring for them in their home and handling their bills, finances, etc. She had moved in with them following her divorce a few years prior. Although she once had a successful career and is quite intelligent, my Aunt has always been more self-centered, unwilling to ask for help, irresponsible with money, and frankly erratic (like jetting out of the country for weeks at a time without telling anyone.)

When the estate was handled (which took ages since my Aunt was the executor and she was incommunicado and my mom lived far away) my mom was surprised to know the accounts contained roughly 6.5% of what they had contained only months prior when she had visited her parents.

My mom has confided in me that the estate lawyer approached her recently noting that the accounts had many deductions after my Grandfather's death in the several thousands to a ""home banking account"". He suspects my Aunt had been draining the accounts before the estate was settled. He is not pressuring her to pursue it, but felt that it was important to tell her so she could decide. I feel the evidence is ample and my Aunt's behavior (including her reaction to my mom bringing this up) indicates guilt to me. My mom desperately doesn't want to send her sister to jail, but feels that whoever committed this crime should have to pay for it. Furthermore she feels her sister will seek vengeance if she pursues legal action. This situation is causing her a virtual ton of emotional distress.

My questions as a 3rd party are such:

How long does she likely have to decide whether or not to pursue?

What kind of protections are afforded to my mom if she presses charges?

Do you think she has a solid case if the lawyer is approaching her for this?

What kind of fallout is to be expected if my Aunt is guilty and goes to jail?

Thank you for any advice, just trying to support my mom in the most emotionally tolling situation.

•He has not paid his deposit. He has not paid rent for the months of September, October, and now November. He has not paid utilities since September. He does not care for the place and this will cost us with the landlord. The landlord has not confirmed how much is owed to date (all from his share).

•He apparently uses what seems to be meth, and we found baggies of what seemed to be meth around where parked (at the time) in the driveway and in the bathroom around his things in the cabinets.

•His acquaintences are disruptive, he routinely has had long-term guests that use our bathrooms and leave them dirty and smelling extremely bad somehow. On one occasion, an acquaintance of his broke in through the window screen of a room and stuck her hand in to try to get our attention.

•He walks around the house just being loud at many times around the day, which really affects the peace in the house, in general. 

We moved forward and changed the knob on the bathroom to one with a code, since non-payment of water bill. He has threatened to knock the door down, yet it continues to be locked for him for a while. He has not produced payment in full for what he owes, so he has not gained access.

The landlord went over us after he contacted her directly back in late August, and gave him an extension to pay til the 15 of September. Since then, she has told us this is an internal problem and she's been trying to wash her hands. She handed the situation to us and refuses to get too involved. 

He is not on the lease. He is renting with us but is not signed on the lease we have with the landlord.

Any opinions on how to proceed? This is a tricky situation since we're not the landlords. I am to collect rent for November from everyone and give it to the landlord, and it is due today (November 1). We are thinking on serving a ""3-daynotice to pay or quit"". There's a lot of thing on the internet and we don't know how to proceed and not get in (more) cahoots ourselves. 

The rent he owes keeps piling and we need someone to take his spot, but if he's not out we can't do that. And he's made it pretty clear he won't be paying. He stated a few days ago he plans on leaving around December 9 or so. This won't do for obvious reasons. 

We are in San Diego, CA. 

Any advice mates?

[OR] Apartment building forcing the use of a startup app that handles and delays mail,5,dq8ls3,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dq8ls3/or_apartment_building_forcing_the_use_of_a/,6,1572663395.0,"Portland, OR, USA. Fair-Market / Not subsidized housing.

Hi r/legaladvice \- The apartment building I've been in for over a year just made the unilateral decision to roll out a third party software without resident consent, and I'm really concerned.

Some reasons why:

* Residents have been told to change their shipping address on all deliveries, but not change it through official means ([USPS Address Change](https://moversguide.usps.com/mgo/))
* Our building has claimed they will reject packages sent to the address we live at.
* A third party company handling our mail and packages, with a 25% reduction hours available (so, delayed mail)
* This company is a <100 person startup, with weak terms of service & privacy policy that release them of all liability that only has their Series A funding - so general concerns around liability, and the longevity of this company
* Our property has been advertising by placing stickers over the address labels, which also looks like mail tampering

&#x200B;

Based on reading through US & OR code, it looks like there are a few areas of violation:

* Privacy - Sharing our email addresses, phone numbers, names, addresses with a third party without consent ([US 15 6809](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/chapter-94/subchapter-I) §4; §7)
* Mail handling - [18 USC 1701](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2011-title18/pdf/USCODE-2011-title18-partI-chap83-sec1700.pdf), [18 USC 1702](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2011-title18/pdf/USCODE-2011-title18-partI-chap83-sec1700.pdf), [18 USC 1703](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/USCODE-2011-title18/USCODE-2011-title18-partI-chap83-sec1703), [18 USC 1730](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2011-title18/pdf/USCODE-2011-title18-partI-chap83-sec1730.pdf) \+ potentially violating the spirit of [USC 39 601](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/39/601) & [USC 39 3641](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/39/3641)?
* Landlord / tenant - [ORS 90.320](https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.320), [ORS 90.730](https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.730), [ORS 90.262](https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.262), [ORS 90.510](https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.510), [ORS 90.525](https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.525)

I'm trying to figure out the best way to proceed. The app and our building have told us this is just happening - no notice, no consent. Without accepting the TOS the App has, it looks like a lot of residents might end up in a limbo with most of our packages rejected, or carriers calling us to manage.

To make a long story short: I was a junkie and as a result did a lot of dumb, questionable things. I have been clean for eleven years now. 

About a week and a half ago I was contacted by CPS, who asked if I knew (Mary Smith), a woman with whom I had a relationship when I was on drugs. I said yes and was informed that she had a child, (Emma Lastname), who had been taken from the home and I was named as her father. With no other contactable family she could come to me or otherwise go to foster care. It was relayed to me that I was listed as the child's father on her legal documents as well. 

To cut out some bullshit from the middle here, I'll just skip to the fact that I did accept emergency custody of the child and I do actually pretty strongly believe that I'm probably her biological father for a number of reasons but I feel like at this point the case workers have been unhelpful and are basically like for all intents and purposes you're her legal father bye!!! And not answering my questions. ((Emma) apparently knew I existed and was told through her life that I was her father but her mother said she had no way of contacting me, which I guess is technically true). 

My questions:

1) how was I listed on the birth certificate, legal records, school records, etc and literally never informed ever at any point? How is this possible? 

2) the case worker said that because I'm on the birth certificate (and the undertone here was ""unless you have an identical twin somewhere that is 100% your child"") there's no need to take a DNA test. Is there any benefit to doing so? 

3) this one I may have to consult with a lawyer on, but if I'm her father, am I then entitled to child support? Or the foster care stipend? That sounds terrible but I don't make a lot of money and I'm stressed because there's times I feel like I'm not sure if I'm going to have enough for myself even working full time, and I need to be able to provide for a kid now too.

So my roommate (roomie) bought an 8 week old kitten a couple of weeks ago. We live in an apartment in West Virginia. The apartment doesn't allow pets, so she registered it as an Emotional Support Animal. The only problem is, it's not an ESA because she never went to a therapist, never got any ESA person to approve of it, and she never told the apartment place about having an ESA. She also never asked our third roommate if he was okay with her getting the kitten (which he isn't). Roomie also said she'd get furniture covers for the apartment given furniture, but she never did. She never paid for food, she never feeds it, and she let the litter box get full for two weeks before she cleaned it. I've been having to take care of it by feeding the kitten every morning and night, playing with the kitten, cleaning up after the kitten, and letting the kitten sleep with me every night. Roomie also stays at her boyfriend's place 5 out of 7 days of the week and is never home. My boyfriend wants to take the cat and rehome it at his mother's house. I'm okay with that but I don't know if anyone could legally get in trouble for ""stealing"" the cat. Roomie doesn't have papers saying the cat is hers officially, all she was given was an immunization record. She's also mentioned before to me that it was her cat becuase she paid for it, but she told our other roommate when confronted that it was a ""communal cat"" so can I or my boyfriend get in legal trouble for taking the cat to a better home? Is there another method we could go about to relocate the cat?",0
Attorney fees,1,dqf0sl,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dqf0sl/attorney_fees/,1,1572694324.0,"I live in a major city and have been sued for $1.2mm in a revenge lawsuit. Defending it is a huge financial burden on me, which is what the other party is trying to accomplish. There's nothing to his case, but just to get to a summary judgment hearing is going to cost me a fortune because I need 5 depositions and a bunch of discovery. I also need to defend a bunch of meritless motions. The plaintiff has unlimited resources and isn't playing with his own money. He's filing motions just for the sake of. I asked him to seal my settlement from a previous suit because it had an nda, and he refused and said he had the right to publicly file it because he's suing me for breach of that settlement. That's definitely not legal to do, otherwise everyone making settlements would just  expose them by filing a friviolous suit. But if i want to fight him on sealing it, it'll cost me $5k in legal fees. He keeps doing this for every ask I make, but I can't afford to enforce anything.

My lawyers cost about $400/hr, and since they understand the plaintiff is suing for revenge, they have informed me that it will likely go to trial. I asked for an approximate budget and was told it'd be between $140k and $220k to defend. I was also told I couldn't sue for intentional infliction of emotional distress or for a frivolous suit (this guy constantly has suits going) or the other side would file a Slaap motion, which would cost me legal fees on my side and his. This guy also won't settle because it's a revenge suit. 

So basically, I'm getting sued and can't countersue for anything. On top of that, I'm paying filing fees for a suit that I didn't bring, which makes no sense.

How am I supposed to pay $200k to defend myself? What normal person can afford that? And how do I win against someone who can afford the biggest firm with the scummiest lawyers who will play dirty and make it impossible to get discovery without constant motions? 

I feel helpless against someone who silences his victims with expensive lawsuits. I am going to lose everything just trying to win the case. I feel like my life has been taken from me. I've fallen into a major depression and stopped seeing a future for myself. Is there anything I can do?",1
"Death and stamps and paintings, oh my!",1,dqezr3,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dqezr3/death_and_stamps_and_paintings_oh_my/,0,1572694145.0,"Hi! Let me get right to my story. When my grandma died 14 years ago, she died without a will. She told my mom and brother and sister and I that she wanted us to basically take whatever of her stuff we wanted with the exception of a few things that she specifically wanted to go to someone else (mostly jewelry). We made sure all those got to where they were supposed to go right after the funeral, btw. 

My grandma had this painting she got at a garage sale like 30 years ago that my aunt thought she was entitled to. My mom loves the painting, but told her that if she was willing to pay to ship it in advance, she could have it (she lives several states away, and it’s a pretty sizable painting).

This week my mom had a massive stroke, and I’m actually sitting next to her in hospice writing this. It was unexpected and we had been trying to get her to make a will for years without any luck. My uncle, whom I have a really bad history with, told me tonight that my aunt should finally get that painting. However, my brother, who’s been taking care of her for years wants it, and that’s one of the few things of hers he actually wants to keep. Mom had also inherited a big stamp collection that’s potentially worth a few thousand dollars from my grandma that I plan to take for my siblings and myself. 

Please don’t think I’m being stingy, I’m happy to give them almost anything else, but that painting is so important to my brother, and I’m pretty sure they just want to sell the stamp collection. It didn’t help matters much that my uncle said that these are the things he wants out of this deal. I wasn’t aware this is a situation that allowed him to demand anything from this. They weren’t even very close siblings. 

So my question is this: because there’s no will and there hasn’t been for the now 3 generations we’ve had these things. Does he potentially have any legal claim to these things?",1
Texas Employment Trouble,1,dqeyo1,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dqeyo1/texas_employment_trouble/,0,1572693953.0,"Texas.  I'm a union employee for a large federal contractor.

I work in a factory setting where there are no ""punch cards"" or ""clock in devices"".  Time is manually entered (daily) by each employee and then approved by their manager (weekly).  It has been this way for close to 50 years.

In this factory, access to a handful of important areas is limited to certain employees by access control software where an employee uses their badge to gain access.  The rest of the factory is open for everyone to roam freely.  Employees assigned to the important areas are often asked to work in the ""roaming"" parts of the factory.  There is also occasional travel associated with certain positions.  The company has no earthly idea where anyone is outside of the important areas.

An agency from the federal government is conducting an audit/investigation and has found some discrepancies between many employee timesheets and time records found in the access control software to the important areas.  Obviously, every employee had discrepancies but I'm assuming they drew the line at some point.

I have been interviewed by both the government agency and the company.  From the questions asked, the best I can tell is the government is after the company and the company is after the employees.

The company reaction to the investigation has been to place all time discrepant employees (identified by the government agency) on paid leave.  Around 50 of us.  I haven't been to work for almost 2 months now awaiting the result of this investigation.

I did nothing wrong.  However, I cannot remember/prove where I was during these descrepant hours/days.  Much of the time in question is 18-24 months ago.  Other than recorded times of entering and exiting the important areas, there are no records of our whereabouts.

A few weeks ago, 15 employees were terminated along with 3 supervisors.

Today the rest of us (about 35) were placed on UNPAID status.

No one has been given an opportunity to account for their time.

I have never been in trouble in my whole life.  Especially with an employer.  Especially Especially with special agents of a government agency.

I do have representation through my union.  They are filing grievances and doing their union stuff.

I have not been fired.  My pay status has changed from paid to unpaid.  Up to this point, this is the first adverse action taken against me.

Should I be looking to retain a lawyer yet?

Should I let the union stuff play out first?",1

I'm looking for some advice/help on a situation I've been involved in. I made a deal with a guy to help out with his company and work for him essentially as a contractor. In return, he'd pay for my cost of living and he would also pay my school tuition. We made a handshake agreement at the beginning of October. Later in October, I sent him an email with all my tuition costs and my estimated cost of living per month. He proposed to me in a seperate email saying that he would pay those expenses and my school tuition. I agreed to this proposal. Shortly after, I purchased a laptop for school related purposes. A few days ago, basically 3 weeks after the original handshake, I got an email basically saying ""I've changed my mind. I will cover your computer but you will be on your own after that.""

Obviously a bad situation but I'm not really sure if there is anything I can do so I was looking for some help on here. Are those emails enough to be considered a contract that I can fight?

The old tenants ( my friends)  mentioned that they were told the fence was going to be fixed, but it has been 6+ months since then.  Upon *my* move-in date, I asked if the fence was going to be fixed and the landlord said that it was broken when I signed the lease and that she's now planning on taking the fence completely down. However, the fence still remains up. Also, one of the landlord's assistants came over for our ""new tenant orientation"" recently and mentioned that they actually fixed a *different* part of the fence that borders the neighbor's yard in August (that must've been broken only for a short time), so he didn't believe the fence was going to be taken down. He said he would talk to the landlord about fixing the fence, but I have heard nothing.

(AZ) Apartment Complex Won't Fix my Ceiling,1,dqegqs,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dqegqs/az_apartment_complex_wont_fix_my_ceiling/,0,1572691092.0,"I apologize for formatting since I'm on mobile.

I live on the second floor of a two-story apartment. My apartment complex recently hired a roofing company to redo the roofs of each of the buildings. As the roofers were hammering, they dislodged a large piece of sheetrock that was installed inside the roof, which fell through my bathroom ceiling and covered my one bathroom in insulation and sheetrock. I only discovered it after coming home late from work and the office was closed, so I figured I'd call the maintenance team in the morning to get it done.

The incident happened on Wednesday. I called and opened an emergency request on Thursday morning-it wasn't done when I got back from work. I talked to the leasing office Wednesday night, where they called the maintenance guy in front of me and chewed him out for not fixing it. I told them I'd be gone Friday for work, so he has plenty of time to do it the next day. I receive an email while I'm at work saying the request was taken care of, so I assumed it was fixed. Tonight I got home late again and there was still a large hole in my ceiling! I managed to catch the leasing office before they closed, and spoke to the same people. They called the on-call maintenance person and told me he'd fix it tonight.

Maintenance guy shows up, looks at the hole and tells me he can tape it tonight, but he won't fix it. He also said since the problem was caused by their vendors, it's the vendors responsibility. He *also* said they wouldn't be allowed to fix it until their boss inspected it, and that won't be until Monday or Tuesday at the earliest.

This is ridiculous. There is a hole in my ceiling and no one seems to care. I can't even use my shower since now that the maintenance guy ripped out the cracked sheetrock, you can see the piece that fell is still in the roof and could still fall through the hole above me. What are my options? I assume Arizona isn't the most tenant-friendly state, but I have to try.

I'm currently in a long-distance relationship with a girl from New York and her apartment's lease is up December 1. This naturally means that the landlord has started showing the place to potential tenants.

Here's the situation:   
Her landlord has threatened to withhold her security deposit under the claim that he needs to replace the hardwood flooring. The landlord is attempting to claim that the floors have been damaged from the cats, but there is no visible damage on the floors. Does the landlord have a legal basis to do such a thing and withhold her security deposit with little to no proof?",0

Fortunately, my neighbor saw town employees taking down the branches and took a photo as he thought it was odd as none of the branches extended out to the street.

We contacted the Department of Public Works who at first said that it wasn't them but then when I provided them with the photo put me in contact with the superintendent of DPW. He e-mailed saying that it never should have happened and that they're  only supposed to trim branches that go onto the street (which these did not). And that employees need to get approval from a supervisor before going onto our property - not to mention we were never notified about this. He also made note that the employee in the photo wasn't wearing any safety equipment while operating a chainsaw on our property.

They're bringing it to the town board and we're waiting to hear back. He made mention of ""working on some way to rectify this situation"". It looks really bad and once the leaves come back in the spring, it's going to be more noticeable - like the front of our tree is bald. Plus, two of the strongest branches were removed and we wanted to eventually put a swing on it for our newborn.

So to keep things as brief and general as possible, I have Ulcerative Colitis and nearly died from it. As a result I'm still dealing with the disease but am able to be at work full time. If anyone knows about UC (I also have IBS-sweet combo) knows when it's active it's a monster to deal with and I spend a lot of time in the bathroom. 

This is not something that is fun for me. But my workplace (which is a huge corporation) has made accommodations for me, which I appreciate. One of which, is allowing me to use the restroom whenever I need but putting in exemptions for my time so it doesn't count against me. 

I'm not in remission yet, so my average daily time spent in the restroom is about 30 minutes (I know... I hate my life) at work. Earlier in the week my boss approached me and said he was looking at the average time spent and that it was comparable to my two paid breaks. As a result they want to take away my two paid 15 minute breaks. I was stunned, as it's not like I'm having a party in there. I use my actual breaks and lunch to walk because I find it helps the autoimmune side of the disease. 

I work full time and am a great worker. I like what I do. My stats support this. I called HR the same day and the agent said AZ has no break laws like CA and CO does so it goes by the general company handbook which states full time workers are required two 15 mins and a lunch. 

The reason I'm posting this is bc she was pretty vague and unsure, and I don't know what kind of actions my work can take against me. UC is covered under the ADA, so I don't think he actually brought this up to hr or his supervisors, bc anyone with a brain would (I hope) see this as a major legal issue. I mean... It's 2019, and I feel like I'm being punished for having a shitty (sorry) disease. 

Is it legal for them to take away my breaks?",0

My in-laws were in town this past weekend to go to a football game, and while they were here my sister in-law wanted to see my pet snake. I didn’t care, and she was with my girlfriend so I told them to knock themselves out. I don’t pay it any more mind, and go to bed. The next morning I wake up and go check on them like I do every morning, and I see that the top of his cage is completely off and on the floor and he is gone. I have clips on his cage top so he can’t simply push it up and get out. I have had my pet snakes escape before, and from my personal experience as well as what other people have said, snakes will always stay as low as possible and find a warm dark place to hide. I have turned my entire apartment upside down multiple times trying to find him and have found no sign. He’s a decently large snake too (2.5-3 feet and about 2in. In diameter) so he can’t get in some really tight places. 

It’s also worth mentioning that she was talking about how much her and her boyfriend wanted a pet snake. My girlfriend asked her directly if she took him and of course she denied it, but she is going to get their mother to go look tomorrow. I think telling her was a mistake, as she now has warning and can hide the snake at her boyfriends house now. 

What can I do in this situation? I feel so helpless and lost. I want to get the police involved with a search warrant but I am also sure that my gut feeling isn’t near enough to get one. Can I do anything about this or am I SOL? Thanks for any help you can give.

Help. I have my children a lot and child support is crippling me financially (Illinois),4,dq8aoa,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dq8aoa/help_i_have_my_children_a_lot_and_child_support/,4,1572662024.0,"Hello.

Currently, I live in Illinois.  I am not sure where to start but I will give some short backstory and then more current events.  Sorry for the length but I want to be thorough with my information.

In a previous relationship I had two children with a woman.  We were in a relationship that fell apart.  During that time it was a bad experience.  We lived with my parent and she was in the middle of moving.  My Mom moved down South and we had to vacate the house.  I moved in with a friend and she moved in with her Mom and Step-dad.  But during our relationship, she was awful with money and was constantly mishandling it and not putting important things first (Getting our own place, paying off bills, etc.) and putting luxuries first (Make-up, eating out, clothes, etc.) and really lazy when it came to doing pretty much anything.

&#x200B;

A few weeks later, she went silent.  I could not find her on social media and I could not contact her via phone.  Without the funds to find her and my kids I was at the mercy of just looking through social media.  About 7 months later, I got a letter for a court summons to collect child support.  I later found out (I forget how) that she moved in with her friends in Michigan.  When she appeared in court it with my kids I was heartbroken they couldn't remember me and I told the judge what she did.  It moved from child support to getting her back into the state since she left without permission at the advice of her ""Lawyer"" friend.  This ended up in her trying to manipulate me and sweet talk me into letting her stay in Michigan because things were so good for her there.  I could not take the chance she would do what she did again and said no and she eventually moved back.  She was very angry and hostile about it but I just couldn't take the chance I would go without seeing my kids.

&#x200B;

They determined my child support payments for the time being while I had the job I currently had and I had no problem with it.  I knew there was a negative stigma for child support.  But I thought it would go to help the child and pay for their things.  I didn't feel negatively about it.  But during this time she was still out of state and I got a job promotion.  I was able to start working full-time.  And I was able to move out with my new fiance into a home.  While we were not financially stable we were still able to make payments on living arrangements as long as something tragic didn't happen.

&#x200B;

This is where it got difficult.  I went back to court and she didn't show up.  There was a different judge who seemed to favour her being the mother.   I brought in my pay stubs to get a better determination of my payments.  She didn't show up but they assumed she made minimum wage.  They looked over my pay stubs (with my insurance I was providing for myself and my children).  They determined that my payments were to increase.  I told them I could not afford that.  If I had to pay that amount I would have to drop my insurance and the kids insurance to compensate and get another job.  They made an adjustment to slightly lower (although still much higher than before) and the judge reluctantly granted it.

&#x200B;

A few weeks later, while still struggling to pay my bills, I noticed that the adjustment was removed.  While I struggled with this I have been unable to find a way to get this taken care of.

&#x200B;

In the meantime, I have switched jobs, gotten married, and unfortunately (or happily depending on the stance you are looking at it) had another child (not under the best circumstances).  While I am barely keeping afloat with all these payments I am frustrated because of a few reasons:

1. I have my children CONSTANTLY.  Sometimes 4 days a week.  So I have them a majority of the time.  There are times where I do only have them 3 days but usually it is from Saturday - Wednesday.  Why are my payments so high if I have them so much?  It is very rare at this time that I have them for less than 3 days.
2. She lives at her mom's apartment with no living expenses whatsoever.  She didn't even have to pay for a phone until recently.  And I constantly see her coming into the apartment with new video games (and a new video game console a few weeks after she got her first CS check), new hair colours, new nails, new clothes, etc.  Meanwhile, my wife and I are lucky if we can get a new dress shirt for work or constantly have to shop Goodwill and second-hand shops.
3. She can't hold a job.  Her longest employment from as long as I have known her has been 5 months.  She is constantly getting fired for attendance issues.  Even just recently.
4. Where she lives with her Mom my kids share a bed together in the room with their Mom.  Sometimes they say they sleep on the floor.  Here at my house they have a room they share with my wife's daughter.  And they have their own beds.  This seems small but I don't know if she has plans to move out and I feel it is important for them to have their own beds.  This has become a problem with sleeping at my house.
5. While we all get along my wife follows her on Instagram.  She told me that she is constantly getting art commissions.  While unrelated it is unsettling to know that while I am struggling with bills, credit cards, and rent she is able to afford commissioned art of herself (while mentioning other previous things)
6. They constantly smell like smoke.  While it isn't like they are in direct contact with them (I have no way of telling) I know that their Mom, her mom, and her step-dad all smoke.
7. I don't agree with the punishments they get in their home (spanking, slapping their bottoms, etc.) I don't want my children to be hit when they are bad and always try to find the patience to punish them, even if it means punishing them several times until they understand by sending them to their room or putting them in the corner.  I know if I had them that this may not stop but it is still something I am concerned about.
8. I would really just like to have custody of them honestly at this point.  But I am so afraid of making her angry.  She gets very spiteful and hostile when she is angry or upset.  And at the time of court, I couldn't take them because I lived with a friend.  And I am afraid of what she would do as far as letting me see the kids or even responding to messages I send her about scheduling.  I think them being with their other siblings and being able to go to the same school would be incredibly helpful for them.  They would never have to be with a sitter since there is always an adult at this house (wife works overnight and I am during the day.
9. I am worried about her Mom as well.  When her mom was getting divorced, custody was awarded to the father.  I am unsure of the EXACT reasoning, but I was told by both my ex and several other people that she was violent.  I have witnessed this in the past in an altercation within her family and have heard several stories from the past.
10. While this hasn't been an issue recently it was an issue in the past but their clothes were always too small and their shoes were entirely outgrown.  I had to buy them new things because they just didn't seem to be getting them when they were with her (furthering my suspicion on the money and where it goes). 
11. She currently works but she is constantly being ""let go"" on her scheduled days early.  Due to my previous experience on her work ethic I am left to believe that she is just leaving early and/or I wouldn't be surprised if she was let go from this job as well.

&#x200B;

There are several other reasons this bothers me but these are the biggest that myself and my wife have noticed.  I can't get a second job again.  I work 40+ hours a week and my wife works overnights.  Everything would conflict with school for the step-daughter and having someone watch the 6 month old baby.  I have tried donating plasma (that is extremely difficult to schedule with my job and demanding on my body).  But I'll never catch up if things keep going this way.  I'll eventually go back into collections , lose my car, have to move out again, and everything I spent the last few years trying to build up will fall back down.  I started to but things then started falling apart.  I am constantly stressed out about money and my wife and I are trying so hard to keep things together for all the kids to be a family.

&#x200B;

I know that some of this may be subjective but these are the things that I have noticed.  While I know I don't have a full picture of everything, I was in a relationship long enough to have a really good judgment on the extent of the things she is doing.  I know how much money she spends on things and where her priorities are from having known her so long.  And I have a good idea where my money is going.

&#x200B;

What can I do at this point?  I don't want to give too much personal information (Yearly salary, names, identifiable info, etc.) but I welcome any messages or comments needing more information.  I also understand that some of this seems silly and immature but I really need some relief.  I take care of my kids the best I can and I always try to put them first.  How can I approach this without putting the final nail in the coffin financially?  Is there any hope that I could just have custody of them so they have a sense of normalcy in their life?

&#x200B;

I live in Illinois.

"Ended up in a bad real estate deal, with multiple major issues not disclosed or found in inspection . Should I pursue legal recourse?",7,dq568h,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dq568h/ended_up_in_a_bad_real_estate_deal_with_multiple/,2,1572648245.0,"I initially posted my situation to /r/RealEstate, so there are a few more details there if interested.  I had pretty much written off legal action as a fool's errand in my situation, but enough commenters suggested it may be worth pursuing that I'll ask your opinion.

Reposting the relevant legal questions below:

I recently bought my first house.  It's a $200,000 house in Michigan, and I put 20% down.  I bought it as a  move-in ready starter home, and 200k is fair for this level house in  this neighborhood.  The inspection found no major  issues, and the house appraised at 205k.  Closed without any issues.

Since  I moved in just a month ago, I've run into one MAJOR problem after  another.  After the first rain, I discovered a leak in the finished  basement, and a couple of small puddles in the attached garage.  I've  since discovered additional leaks in basement, and found that source of  the leak in the roof is some rotted portions of roof edge, which has  been there for long enough to cause significant structural rot to the  wall below (the wall will likely need to be completely  reframed/replaced).  Another roof edge / wall in the garage has similar  issues, though not as far advanced (repairing the roof there may be  enough).  There are signs of the same sort of rotting roof edges along  portions of the house as well, though seems to be the most minor at this  point.

None  of this was was disclosed by the seller.  I have absolutely zero doubt  they knew the basement leaked and the garage leaked since there were  sizeable puddles after the first rain and every rain after.  I have  little doubt they knew the garage leak was coming in from the roof, but  it's at least possible they're incompetent or didn't care enough  diagnose it.  Either way, I've done enough research to gather that it's  next to impossible to prove they knew of about any of this, no matter  how obvious.  Is it worth consulting with a lawyer, or am I totally  barking up the wrong tree with that?

Some  of this should have been found in the inspection.  I could see the  basement leak being hard to find when not active, but the shingles at  the edge of the roof are cupped, and the wood below is so rotted it's  completely disintegrated.  The wall of the garage is so rotted you can  move it by leaning against it, and there's some clear water damage and  mold there that should draw one's attention for closer inspection.  I  feel ignorant for not noticing these things, but as a first time buyer, I  didn't know what to look for, and I placed trust in the inspector  (obviously too much trust).  I don't expect to hold the inspector liable for  repairs, but any chance I could get my $700 back since I really didn't  get the product I paid for?  It's not much, but it's something.

Is any of this even worth pursuing?  If I start by scheduling a free consultation, how should I prepare to get the most out of it?  What sort of documentation should I bring, what sort of questions should I ask?  Do I stand a better chance of winning a smaller judgement in small claims, or is that just a cheaper route with the same or lower chance of success?  Is this is a type of case a lawyer might take on with payment as a percentage of the judgement only if successful, or is the chance of success too low for them to bother?

I was also charged with the possession of adderall, although I can provide sufficient evidence that the substance did not belong to me. Although I plead my case of having no intent to distribute, and that these substances were all for my own personal and recreational use, I was still charged with intent to distribute. I am suspended from the university and have lost my housing. Throughout my time at this university, I have been an outstanding student and member of the community. I am extremely involved in campus life, uphold very high academic standards, and have never gotten into any trouble whatsoever prior to this incident. 

I am sure many of you will roll your eyes at this post – a college student getting caught up with drugs and not liking the wrath of the consequences. However, I know that I am so much more than this and am confident in my abilities of turning my life back around. I will not be able to do this with the suspension and the loss of my housing. I want to get back to school and get back on track. I have no where else to go if I am not allowed back to that campus. That is all I want. I am looking for some guidance in writing my appeal, as this is my last and final chance to plead my case. My question is, how do I about discussing the intent to distribute and the falsely alleged possession of controlled substance charge in my appeal? I am not sure how this subreddit works, but I appreciate the time any of you have taken to read this post and am eternally grateful for any sort of guidance that can be given regarding the best possible way to go about my appeal. Thank you in advance.",4
[West Virginia] Illegal U-Turn and Expired Registration,0,dqdyh3,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dqdyh3/west_virginia_illegal_uturn_and_expired/,0,1572688276.0,"Last night I went to go pick up a friend from the club and I was accompanied by a few other friends. Since they didn't know the directions to it I offered to drive one of their cars to pick her up. Once we're driving, we're on a one way road and the club is on the opposite side of that road so I decided to just drive to the next four way stop sign intersection and made a U-turn onto the same road we were on since I had planned to pick her up at the door. When I made the U-turn there was no oncoming traffic from any of the other parts of the intersection so I didn't think much of it since it seemed like an innocent turn at the time. In our town, most cars aren't even out at midnight so at this point we were the only car driving on this road. After I made the U-turn, we got stopped by a police officer.

The cop took my license and the car's registration and then after processing everything he came back to the car and basically told us that he was charging me with making an illegal U-turn and apparently the registration was expired. Unfortunately, I obviously had no idea the car's tags were expired since it wasn't my car, but I still got the charge because I was the one operating the vehicle. Since the ticket didn't tell me how much each charge was, I had to call the police station earlier today to see how much I had to pay. The clerk told me that the U-turn would cost me $180 and the expired registration would be $155.

Apparently in WV you can dismiss an expired registration violation by just renewing it and showing it at your court hearing, but the registration would've had to expire the month the ticket was issued. Her car's registration expired October 1st, but I ended up being issued the ticket 8 minutes after the month was over. After the clerk explained this to me she said that the judge may be lenient and dismiss it either way because it wasn't my car and it was only 8 minutes after the month. I feel confident in fighting that charge, but my thing is I have no idea how to fight the U-turn. I was surprised at the price of the U-turn though--$180 seems excessive. I have never been pulled over either so I assumed the cop might've been nice and let me off with a warning. As of right now, I'm a college student and so I don't have this type of money because I need to literally pay for college and just other necessities, otherwise I would just pay off the ticket. I'm also just scared that my insurance it going to go up because of this. Does anyone have any advice on how I could argue these charges at my hearing? At least to maybe just get the price of the ticket reduced? I've tried looking up WV traffic laws when it comes to making a U-turn at a 4-way stop sign intersection, but I couldn't really find anything.",0
Can my dad take half of all my mom's money in a divorce?,6,dq6abo,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dq6abo/can_my_dad_take_half_of_all_my_moms_money_in_a/,5,1572653181.0,"We live in NY. My parents got married around 1987. They fought constantly (bc my mom would get so angry about him not providing for his family/contributing anything) when I was growing up and my dad moved out around 2010. I’m pretty sure they’re not even formally separated — they just don’t live together. 

My mom is terrified of divorcing my dad because she thinks he would be able to take half of all her money. I don’t understand how he has a right to it because he has barely contributed to anything. Here is a rundown:

My mom has had a very well paying secure job at a large corporation for over 30 years. She makes 6 figures. She bought the apartment (but the deed is in both of their names) and she was the one who paid the mortgage off. She paid for 13 years of private school, summer camp, and my babysitter who worked 5 full days a week until I was in high school. She has paid all of my college tuition. I think my dad might have made a few elementary school tuition payments but never anything close to the cost of a year’s tuition. He paid for things like my soccer team and piano lessons. My mom pays (and paid) all the taxes and maintenance fees for the apartment. Again, my dad might have paid a handful but very rarely and only when my mom begged him to help.

Both my dad and I are on my mom’s health insurance (yes, they have been separated for 10 years but he is still on her insurance. It’s infuriating to me). My mom paid for him to be on our cell phone plan up until 3 years ago. 

You may be wondering what my dad’s income is. My dad practices law very casually. He consults for a friend of his now and then and that’s his only income. When my parents were still living together, he would sometimes go into the office he paid rent for but BARELY. Usually he’d still be on his computer in his pajamas when I came home from school. My mom had to beg him to give up the office and stop paying meaningless rent while he wasn’t even contributing to bills at home. When he was home, my babysitter would be there also. So he wasn’t ever providing care for me or cooking dinner or picking me up from school or doing any stay at home dad duties. 

My dad’s mom just died and left him a bunch of money. Like probably 500k or a little less. As far as I understand it, I think that inheritance isn’t counted as how much money you have when you’re in court. But he and his girlfriend have gone on two trips to Europe in the last 6 months so obviously he has money to spend. 

So what I’m wondering is if my dad has a legal right/claim to half of my mom’s bank account if they go to court to get divorced. I would understand if he had provided care for me while my mom was working but he DIDN’T. I had a babysitter picking me up from school and making me dinner and all that stuff. He literally sat at home on his computer pretending to work. He refused to drive me to school even though he had nothing going on because he didn’t want to sit in the car and wait to find a parking spot. He has paid essentially nothing towards my education or care. I think he sees me as something that’s not his burden or responsibility and it’s all my mom’s job to provide for me. But they’ve been married for so long and has been on my mom’s health insurance. There is a record of her supporting him. Does that mean she would have to provide support for him after the divorce? 

Also, my dad once stole $4,000 from my mom’s checking account (he literally used her debit card to take it out of the ATM) and denied it for weeks until he finally admitted it was him. Idk if that makes a difference to anything but I thought I should add it.

Edit to add: my mom’s fear is also that he will be super nasty to her in court and aggressive and do a lot of lawyer tricks (direct quote lol, idk what that means). As I said, he is a lawyer (not a divorce lawyer tho). She just feels it’s easier to live the rest of their lives apart rather than get divorced. But she deserves a life free from him.",6
Rat issue at rented house. Unresponsive landlord. - Pennsylvania,3,dq83ct,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dq83ct/rat_issue_at_rented_house_unresponsive_landlord/,5,1572661098.0,"Hello, I'm a Pennsylvania resident renting an apartment that I've been having issues with.

&#x200B;

The place we're renting is a 2 story building where the entire living area is on the second floor. The bottom floor consist of a basement and a 2 car garage. One side of the garage was closed off and the landlord lets their brother use it as a storage space. Neither of the garage doors have a built-in working locks, however the brothers door has a pad lock on it. Neither door goes all the way to the ground, however with the pad lock in place the gap is about 3 inches off the ground.

&#x200B;

We know that this is at least one of the ways the rats are getting into the house, because when I came home once and saw one crawling out underneath the door. In the basement, there are a bunch of holes in the ceiling where the rat is most likely coming through from the brothers side. I'm fairly certain that, while they've gotten into our side garage, they haven't gained access to the basement that way.

&#x200B;

We sent an email to the landlord stating that there was an issue with the door and that rats were getting into the house that way about a week ago. 2 days ago, the brother came and opened up his garage door to look around, he swore a little, and left. We haven't had any response or phone calls from the landlord.

&#x200B;

The storage area is right below where my son sleeps and the noise that rats are making down there are waking him up in the middle of the night. My fiance is 1 week post surgery, so she's unable to do anything about the rats while I'm at work and is at a high risk for infection. I've purchased poison and rat traps in order to try to get rid of them or at least deter them but as long as they're using the storage area we don't have access to, it's futile. 

&#x200B;

I'm looking for a legal way to force the landlord to acknowledge the issues, or a way to get out of the lease if necessary. If we're able to get out of the lease we don't have a place to stay and no security deposit as I'm sure it'd be a battle to get ours back if we did find a means to terminate the lease due to some sort of uninhabitable conditions.

I hope this album works:

They told the cops an 11 year old was responsible do no charges filed. Prior to this I was nice to them and even gave them the materials to make slime.  They continued to roam and cause damage.

Car theft total loss question,0,dqdusy,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dqdusy/car_theft_total_loss_question/,2,1572687733.0,"My vehicle was stolen on the 3rd of October in Colorado. I filed a police report the same day and didn’t expect to see it again. 

Since then I’ve made an insurance claim and bought a new vehicle. Insurance was dragging their feet and sent me multiple packages of duplicate paperwork, which I’m assuming was to drag out the process even longer in the hopes that it’d be recovered. 

On the 30th of October my claim status on the website changed to “Total Loss Settlement Accepted,” but I haven’t been paid yet, as they are settling things with the lien holder. 

Well today my nightmare came true, the car has been recovered but is a total shit show with dings, the smell of smoke, and “used” panties found in it. 

I’m in a bit of a panic, because I now have a new vehicle, haven’t been paid out yet, and have Dirty Mike’s bang wagon in my possession. 

I’m hoping someone can put my mind at ease and let me know if the vehicle now belongs to insurance due to the status change.

Landlord Violating SCRA rights...HELP,1,dqdrrg,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dqdrrg/landlord_violating_scra_rightshelp/,4,1572687290.0,"\*\*\*DISCLAIMER\*\*\*

I know this is a lot of information, and I apologize for the lengthy post ahead of time, but I'm trying to be as thouroughly descriptive as possible and I'm running out of both options and time. I truly and deeply appreciate anyone who takes the time to both read this, and/or respond. Thank you all.

&#x200B;

Brief intro to the problem:

I am Active Duty Military, have been for 7 years now, and I terminated my lease early due to a Permanent Change Of Station through Military Orders from NH to CA. I gave the landlord >30 days written notice, with a copy of my orders, and he signed/dated both papers as a receipt acknowledgement that I kept in case this exact thing came up.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to date:

After hearing nothing from my landlord for 26 days after terminating lease, and not receiving a check for my $1700 security deposit, I texted the landlord asking for an update and received an email response in which he is demanding forfeiture of my security deposit AND is charging me a grand total of $17,168.02 which he broke down into:

\- $568.02 (water/sewer utilities that I was responsible for as defined in my lease, although while living there he requested I go to town hall to get the bill in my name, I did, and they told me that he needed to do it himself since he's the property owner...I communicated that information to him and he never completed it, nor brought it up until now)

\- $2310 (cost of re-advertising at $30/day x 11 weeks)

\- $250 (cleaning as outlined in the lease, did not provide receipt)

\- $440 (showings and phone calls about renting taken at $5/min for 32 calls, and $30/showing x 8 showings)

\- $11,900 (cost of rent for the remaining 7 months of rent unpaid due to early termination)

&#x200B;

As of yet, I have not received a notice for a lawsuit, however, I would like to reclaim my security deposit at a minimum. I have been trying to seek some sort of legal council for days and have come up with nothing. My new bases' legal office does not take walk-ins and all appointments are booked until November 25, 2019. Oh and I leave for deployment in early December. 

I seriously need some help, or someone to point me in a direction of someone to speak with about this issue. To be clear, I'm not looking for a referral to a lawyer to represent me, just someone who can help me sort out all the legal terminology and process for this sort of thing. I cannot afford the time required for a lawsuit, and this landlord is violating federal law already (today 11/1/19 was the expiration of the 30 day return of deposit requirement).

Again, I'm sorry for the long post, I'm just running out of options quickly and I feel like everyday I am not prepared is another day he is.",1

How long can someone delay a jury trial?,2,dqaxb0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dqaxb0/how_long_can_someone_delay_a_jury_trial/,3,1572673488.0,"A buddy of mine (lets call him steve) is going through the court system, and his story has me asking a few questions about the system as a whole. Was wanting to get your opinions on the situation because im genuinely curious about how common this situation is.

TLDR; The defendant is adamantly wanting a jury trial, but the plantiff is (seemingly) doing everything they can to delay in order to force a plea deal. How much can they actually do that?

The story starts with Steve being arrested for assault. Steve says it was self defense, and claims the guy (lets call him john) swung first and missed. Steve, a former mma fighter, responded to the threat in front of him. Ontop of this threat, steve feared that john had a gun, and therefore was more forceful with his response. This fear was based on body language and the fact that, in steves words, ""he got alot more confidence in his voice once he got by his desk"". Well after john got pretty badly beat up, he managed to run from the building. Steve immediately called the police to report the incident from johns own desk phone. 

John (obviously) sued steve for assault, and he was arrested. Released on bail and forced to where an akle braclet for a year before the court decided to remove it. From day 1 steve has said he wants to go to a jury trial. Steve's defense attorney has said based on story, video evidence, and limited testimonies of everybody, that steve has an 80% chance of winning his case. However john is dragging out the case by repeatedly waiting until the last minute, and then doing something to reset the clock. Just one example is that john sat down for a deposition and objected to literally everything except saying his middle name, and somehow this resulted in the case being pushed even further in the future because another deposition needed to be scheduled a few weeks/months later.

At this point its been a year and a half, and since day 1 steve has been saying to go to jury trial. Now it seems steves attorney is even pushing him to accept a plea, talking about the risk to his kids (as a single dad him in jail isnt a good thing), talking about potential for future civil suits about this case when the criminal part is through, talking about the cost of actually going to trial, etc. At this point i understand his lawyer is probably just giving him good council based on how the opposition is playing things, but its still just playing the waiting game. The attorney has pretty much argued with him repeatedly saying he should take a guilty plea because its his best bet. (For reasons i wont disclose partly related to this case, it is difficult for steve to find another attorney to take the case, so getting a different attorney is not likely.)

I know pushing for a plea agreement is common in criminal cases, but what about doing everything one can to delay a jury trial when the other party (though perhaps not his council) is pushing for one?

A year and a half after the incident, Steve has just finally accepted a plea ($10k and a misdemeanor) even though he knows that a jury will find him not guilty. Right now he is waiting to go before the judge to get the plea approved and he's debating on if, when the judge asks ""have you been coerced into accepting this"" hes debating on saying ""yes, i has been"".

My question (to put it simply): is the court system really that f***** up? To the point where a man saying ""give me a jury trial"" for a year and half is basically forced to plea guilty because the opposition isnt letting the case actually move??? Or is this fairly common and waiting over 1.5 years for a jury trial fairly routine?

Follow up question: if he actually claims infront of the judge ""yes ive been coerced"" based on the argument of ""i cant get a jury trial dispite saying i want one repeatedly"", is the judge likely to blow that off? Or will they likely force a jury trial at that point?",2

So, Main Character, (MC) was sitting in the very back of their school bus. Then, Opposing Character, (OC), who had wanted to talk to the person across from MC without having to turn around, wanted to sit with MC. They asked to switch, to which MC respectfully declined. OC then said they'd sit on the inside, to which MC agreed to. MC moved his legs, to allow OC through, and OC shoves MC into the seat, in an attempt to sit on the outside. Ok, no big deal, except the agreement was either OC was on the inside, or not in that seat at all. MC, out of defense, shoved OC out of the seat. OC then attempts to repeatedly force his way into the seat. Apparently, MC was eventually shoved into the seat, against the wall, and, according to MC, OC had 'The most smug look I've ever seen', and so MC, out of instinct, moved out of the lock, and put OC in a different lock for a few seconds before releasing him out of the seat. (Do note it was around the throat area, but it is clear that no major damage was done. OC was still able to breathe).

&#x200B;

The fight ended here, and MC thinks that he would like to call the sheriff on OC, on grounds of assault, and get a restraining order. An apology text was sent by OC, and I read it. It says, in exact quotes: ""Hey just wanted to say sorry about all that I did not wanted it to be like that."" OC has made ""Apologies"" before, saying ""It won't happen again"" or some other bullsh\*t excuse, and continues to violate these promises.

I have used the 2 addresses listed on their website, I have used the address listed on their business license with the state, and I have used the address I found digging through the paperwork that they submitted to the state for insurance through the LARA website (State Licensing website).

My claim is going to expire on the 12th and I have run out of options.  If I call and ask for an address, they give me the one from their website that gets returned.  Do I have any grounds legally for their address on their business license not being legit, or any other means to get this moving forward?  Their call center still picks up the phone and I see their trucks driving around town from time to time, so I know they didn't up and leave or change their name since all of their trucks have their logo and name on them.

Any help would be greatly appreciated, if you need more info out of me just let me know and I will update this post, I just don't want to be out this $1,500 because I trusted a licensed and insured mover to move my things and they damaged it all and refuse to talk to me about it.  I've had to pay out of my pocket for the property damage they caused to *both* apartments, and I am tired of looking at my now 3-corner end tables and the rips in my sofa...

Thank you

Things like stuff getting stolen (pictures that she holds in her wallet because they are important to her). Her classmate also has been forcing her to do stuff she doesnt want, which ofcourse makes her very uncomfortable, which are mostly him wrapping his arm around her waist, trying to hold her hand,  placing his hand on her legs, she has told him countless times that she is not okay with this.
When i told him to knock it off he basicly told me to go scr*w myself, my question is, is there anything we can do about this since as far as i know it doesnt count as rape or sexual assault, we also dont want to get him im major problems. We just want him to leave my friend alone.

How to respond to Cease and Desist Email,2,dqajfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dqajfe/how_to_respond_to_cease_and_desist_email/,5,1572671754.0,"Hello! 

I was part of an online membership, that served as a community for women to support each other. Due to the topics spoken about in the community, the woman who owns the business associated with the membership had us pay to apply and interviewed us to join. When we applied we also had to sign a contract which was I was told was intended to protect the space.

A few days ago, some women in the community felt uncomfortable about the rules being put in place. They expressed their discontent in the group and then were removed by said business owner. They made an Instagram chat together to discuss what had happened and to put together a new support group that was free and less moderated. I was added to this group chat, and then subsequently deleted from the paid membership by business owner. 

Apparently a friend of hers took screen shots of the conversation causing business owner to delete anyone who was part of the chat. 

Now to my legal question: she is sending cease and desist letters to random women citing tortious interferences with her business, defamation, and breeches of confidential information. 

This is completely unfounded due to the fact that no one has poached any of her members, she deleted us. No one is publicly speaking about her, and the new membership group is free and completely unrelated to her business. There are also clauses in the contract citing that competitive businesses are not a breech of contract and her intellectual property would naturally be similar to anything her members do. 

How do we even respond? I called the lawyers number and it’s not associated with a law office, making me wonder if she’s falsifying documents. What is the right path for us to take?",2

I was on my way back to the dominos after my last delivery of the night. It's 12:32am, when BAM, out of complete nowhere in a residential road, I was t boned in an intersection by a Honda bike (which apparently had plates for a Kawasaki bike on it). I got out of my car by crawling through the passenger side door as my driver door was dented in shut, and I already had my phone out recording. I have footage of the guy walking away into the darkness like some regular pedestrian, except with a beat up helmet in his hands.

Cops came, couldn't find the guy with 3 K9 units and 13 cop cars with a 4 block radius shutdown. He was honestly a super soldier. High off of meth or pcp or something. I clearly remember looking at my car, and then him, in the same peripheral, and thinking ""holy shit he's stronger than my 2018 Hyundai Elantra.""

  


My car is deemed totaled, and I have gap insurance through my dealership covering me.

I have uninsured motorist coverage through geico, but they are leaning towards not going with my claim anyways because I did not have commercial insurance while driving my vehicle for dominos.

Controversial thing is, I have only been an employee for two weeks, and was going to go into Management training which is an insider job, no use for a vehicle while working. So why get commercial insurance for two or so weeks?

Unexpected Lien on Owned Vehicle,1,dqd42f,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dqd42f/unexpected_lien_on_owned_vehicle/,0,1572683832.0,"Kansas.

In March, my aunt (who works at a small car dealership) offered to buy me a vehicle as a college graduation gift. She purchased the vehicle with her money, and we signed the paperwork to have the vehicle ownership transferred from the dealership to me. Since she works there, all of the ""seller"" information is signed by her. I was able to get a 60 day tag from the DMV without issues, and received the metal plate by mail (which is the policy in Kansas). The registration receipt, which was mailed to me on June 6th, has my name and address listed as the owner and no liens listed. Based on my last name, my tags expire in October. I mailed a check to our state capital and received the new vehicle registration sticker and document in the mail. Now, there is a lien listed on the registration. The lien named is the dealership for which my aunt works.

Between June and October, my mom and aunt got into an intense argument over my aunts drug usage with my younger brother. I'm guessing she retaliated by adding a lien to my vehicle.

I'm unsure of the legality of this situation. Is it possible for there to be a lien on my vehicle after the original vehicle transfer has been signed? What can I do if she forged my name on a lien agreement? (Because I absolutely did not sign one). What are my next steps if I have evidence to prove I did not sign any documents agreeing to this?

The housing complex I live in has only one elevator. Since September, it has been acting up. Occasionally, it will work; other times, it will get stuck between floors, forcing whoever is inside to call the fire department to get them out. The elevator has been ""closed"" several times. Sometimes they will close a door in front of the elevator, so you can't even use it, but sometimes they just tape a sign over the buttons on the first floor saying the elevator is broken. Problem is, in the latter case, the sign will occasionally fall off or disappear altogether, and people will take the elevator only to get trapped. Furthermore, the elevator has also been ""fixed"" in this time period. We got an email from the housing department saying they were working on it, and it should be fixed by X/Y/2019. After the aforementioned date, I see no sign on the elevator buttons, so I decide to test the waters and ride the beast. Of course I get stuck, and spend a good 20 minutes of quality alone time. While I'm in solitary confinement, I notice that the displayed permit is expired by several months. When the firemen reset the elevator and get me out, they told me that they have had to do the same thing at least once every day for the past week.

Operating an un-permitted elevator seems illegal, even if it is unintentional. The relevant statute I found is  CCR Title 8 §3001 (c), the first part of which reads:

(c) Permit to Operate Required. No elevator shall be operated without a valid, current permit issued by the Division.

(1) The permit, or a copy thereof, to operate a passenger elevator, freight elevator or incline elevator shall be posted conspicuously and securely in the elevator car. For other devices, the permit shall be available on the premises.

So, even if they do have a valid permit, not displaying it in the elevator is illegal. 

My problem is this: I don't know what I am doing. Should I sue? Should I report this to the authorities? It's just a stupid elevator, does any of this even matter? Are there laws protecting me from retribution dished out by the university for snitching on them? Is it worth my time pursuing this at all when I have classes to worry about?

I was driving on the tollway today, behind a semi truck with a good amount of snow on top their trailer. I watched as a big chunk of it blew off and landed in the road in front of me. Wanting to avoid this, I got in the left lane and started to pass.



Well, as I'm coming up next to them, another chunk of snow comes off and lands right on my windshield and sunroof. Pretty much the whole front and top of my car. Holy god it was loud. I freaked out, and I was really concerned something cracked or broke. Luckily it came off after a few seconds. 



Nothing noticeable was wrong on any of the glass as I continued to pass. I didn't know what to do, so after I got ahead (while still in the left lane), I slowed down so I could snap a few pictures of their plates. 



When I got home, I checked my car out, nothing appeared to be wrong. It was dark out, and I'll check again tomorrow, but I'm pretty sure I'm all good.

I print their return shipping label and no freight company is willing to take it (FedEx, UPS, DHL, EMS). I tell Amazon and they instruct me to initiate the return manually. I told them numerous times it will be expensive to send through email and phone, $400 to $500 USD. They advised me to get an economical method and upon checking with all, the cheapest was $507 USD.

They ask me to send it and they WILL pay the money needed to send it to them. 

I get that trusted assurance. I send the TV. They receive it and apparently lose it in their returns centre. I call and enquire after 4 weeks. They said to give them 3 extra days. I oblige. They don't come back to me with anything. They then say they will refund for the purchase. Okay, cool. Here is $483 USD to your method used for payment. I ask for my $507 USD.

Now they tell me they can refund $150 USD only and that's it.

Company finds out they were paying me too much. What can they legally do?,3,dq83ma,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dq83ma/company_finds_out_they_were_paying_me_too_much/,10,1572661127.0,"Location: Bay Area, CA

So I work at a hospital, when I was hired on, the offer letter stated a specific rate, which I thought was somewhat high, but I figured due to my experience/skill and that I’ve worked at that hospital before, they really want me there.  Now, a year later, I’ve done enough hours to advance to the next step on the pay scale ladder, HR informed me that the recruiter made a mistake on my job offer.  I should’ve been at a much lower pay scale, like $10/hr less. She said she needed to do some research, but for sure I won’t need to pay back anything.

Can they put me at a lower pay scale or can I argue that since the offer letter had that number then I’d like to stay at that pay? This means I won’t advance to the next step, but it seems that even the next step is lower than what I’m currently making. 

Thanks for your input!",3

"ARIZONA- Hit with Industrial Equipment by SUPERVISOR (UPS) , Doctor MISDIAGNOSED (Contracted by Employer), Now Have Torn Rotator Cuff",1,dqcujx,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dqcujx/arizona_hit_with_industrial_equipment_by/,0,1572682499.0,"LOCATION - ARIZONA

ANY LEGAL ADVICE WOULD BE APPRECIATED 

Back in March (2019) I was hit in the right arm with a motorized industrial grade heavy duty conveyor belt that goes in and out of trailers called an ""Extendo"" by A SUPERVISOR. I had pain really bad in the shoulder and to make a VERY long story short (hostile doctors refusing to listen to me and refusing an MRI at the time, doctor didnt file a W/C claim and was very neglectful) I had come to find out in September after ordered to see an IME had ordered an MRI, and sure FROM THE IME and MRI says ""MODERATE-TO-HIGH-GRADE-PARTIAL INTRA-ARTICULAR ROTATOR CUFF TEAR"" This is from an addendum report dated 10/9/19. It also states ""She should be referred to an Orthopedic surgeon for definitive care to include probable arthroscopic with arthroscopic rotator cuff repair of the right shoulder""... The IME is also an Orthopedic Surgeon.

So today I go see a different Orthopedic surgeon and to my surprise he says ""No, no, this is NOT indicative of a surgery, this is more of an inflammation issue. All I can do is prescribe Anti-inflammatory and if that doesn't work, then a cortisone shot and that's it. It's not like it's a full tear"" 

I've been dealing with this for 7 months and during the visit he tries to imply that I'm working the system and said some very condescending remarks. All I could do was leave the office in shock. He ALSO tried to RELEASE ME BACK TO FULL DUTY WITH THIS TEAR! What kind of doctor does that? He also implied and questioned my commitment to my employer and integrity because I had a prior injury years ago and the ER doctor from that case said ""This is from typing so much. This is just as normal as carpal tunnel in most secretarial work."" I've been in IT and Help Desk environment since I was 18, so yes I typed A LOT. The surgery was approximately 5 years ago. Never had an issue with THAT process and that was with a tribally owned company which was more complex (ER was out of state and tribally owned company had sovereign entity. I was NEVER treated in a poor manner or had condescending remarks thrown at me like I have experienced with this. In fact, the diagnosis, neurologist and Ortho surgeon treated me properly and kindly. And at the time, I didnt even know it was a workers comp case until a week before the surgery.

Because of my shoulder it has impacted my daily routine and the pain gets in the way of even getting dressed. I cant go shopping for groceries by myself and taking a shower is even painful sometimes! It has affected my quality of life and even gets in the way of taking care of my 2 children.

I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS. I DONT GET IT. I didnt do anything wrong when I was struck, I wasn't working unsafely, I WAS HIT WITH THE EXTENDO BY A SUPERVISOR! Google ""UPS Extendo"" and you'll see what it is. I have gone through so much stress and pain and NOBODY is wanting to help do the right thing EXCEPT the IME who I thought was going to shut down my case. HE got me the MRI and recommended surgery which I'm told by numerous people, to do, EXCEPT for the ORTHO today.

I feel SO bullied by these doctors and not heard, I'm being implied I am working the system, because this is my first warehouse job which i was doing JUST FINE until I GOT HURT BY THIS MACHINE. I have photos of my injury as well. ALSO... This new Ortho is apparently friends with the original doctor and when he asked me to repeat the original doctors name, he said ""Scott? Really? That doesn't sound like him."" I feel like this Ortho fully became bias once I mentioned the previous doctors name and I KNEW he wasn't going to help me by the way he immediately looked at me after I mentioned his name. This Ortho is going to give me a shot (cortisone) then release me to full duty with this tear and I will get into an unload trailer, life something extremely heavy and FULLY TEAR MY ROTATOR CUFF. 

DOES THAT EVEN SOUND RIGHT???? I'm not a doctor but that doesn't make any sense!

*** I have an audio recording of the neglectful Dr who was aggressive and argumentative about granting an MRI. He consented to the recording and he lied in his report about what happened that night he became so confrontational, and even deemed me to go back to work full duty without properly treating me. Because of THE ORIGINAL doctor, I have been in this mess.***

Can someone PLEASE guide me in the right direction on what to do? Should I reach out to an attorney? Or do I just go back to FULL work duty until this rotator cuff fully tears? What will happen if I quit? 

I cant take photos of the IME exam and show anyone who would be kind enough to help.

I NEED SOMEONE TO GIVE ME SOUND LEGAL ADVICE. PLEASE... This has been so stressful, I feel like my mental state is affected, like my memory has been so poor lately, I have been stuttering and shaking when I see a doctor (NEVER had an issue before) I dont even smile anymore or laugh like I used to. Between UPS and the aggressive environment and these shitty doctors, I dont know what to do. Can i just throw in the towel and get this fixed by an Ortho with my insurance? (I didnt have insurance at the time of the accident, just kicked in on September) 

Should I quit? Should I seek an attorney? I have been through the windmill and my fiance has even been stressed from going through this with me. People who hear this story are appalled, what am I doing wrong?",1
Penalties for not insuring your child in Utah?,1,dqcto8,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dqcto8/penalties_for_not_insuring_your_child_in_utah/,0,1572682379.0,"I’m a student in Utah and usually I sign myself and my child up for the student health plan. Due to some administrative snafus outside my control, I’ve been fighting to get signed up since August and they only just signed us up today. The coverage is technically retroactive but I don’t have any expenses to apply it to, and I don’t really want to pay for an entire semester’s coverage for only two months of actual coverage. At this point I’m considering just not enrolling for this semester and signing up for next semester’s coverage that starts in January. I know the tax penalty was eliminated for 2019, but does Utah have any laws that would jeopardize my status as a parent if my child was uninsured from August-December? 

If it’s relevant I don’t have any CPS-related offenses. About a year and a half ago the police stopped by to do a welfare check because my neighbors heard my toddler having a tantrum over naptime but it was pretty evident to the cops that nothing was amiss. I have a green card and my child and husband are citizens.

My child rarely gets sick and the only time we’ve ever needed a doctor is for annual checkups and one time where she got an ear infection. If she got sick between now and January it would likely be cheaper to pay out-of-pocket for one Urgent Care visit and round of antibiotics than it would for me to pay for the entire “semester’s” coverage.",1

I live in Massachusetts and have recently been displaced from my ground floor apartment due to a mold issue that overtook my master bedroom. The damages I submitted to insurance are for \~$6,000. I have reason to believe my property management company is covering up a chronic mold issue in the building stemming from leaks in the upper most (3rd floor) unit above me. My issue is that the property management company won't substantiate the claim for the insurance company to pay out. Can of worms situation for them as it likely affects the guts of the whole building. Even though I have documented everything, I need to prove ""accidental discharge"" of water to recoup. It's really bullshit. The mold growth was a result of the increased humidity with no real visible water damage. Off the record, I've substantiated evidence of the leak in question through conversations with neighbors.

I'm looking a hiring a lawyer now but I thought I'd check in here as I get the ball rolling... How should I approach taking my property management company to court to recoup what I've lost?

At first after the 90 days we were told ownership was shifting to a new and larger company and we couldn’t get our benefits until October 1st.

It's a 9 month apprenticeship that will end with us being hired by the very large technology company. The apprenticeship consists of training us so we can easily step into the role after the end of the apprenticeship, so the training is intense, and time consuming. It's a paid apprenticeship and they chose to keep us as hourly, even though the role we are stepping into is salary. This is in Washington.

From the beginning of the apprenticeship, we were put through a coding bootcamp which expected 70-90 hours a week to pass (which was expected to pass the apprenticeship and keep our jobs). We told the program manager week by week that we were having to put in the 70 to 90 hour weeks and we're told that we shouldn't have to put in over 40 and that's all that is acceptable. this is a department of labor authorized program, and when we discussed what was happening with the representative outside the company that we are officially employed by, they also put us off and made no attempt to help us fix things.

There are definitely more details behind what was happening, but what I am curious about is if we have any action for this overtime since we were not allowed to record the time, and we have been put off for the last 7 months? The only reason that I am now looking into it is because I was concerned that they would revoke our future roles at the company if a time scandal were to happen before we finish. So if I'm going to take any action, it will be in a month or two when I I'm fully moved over to the salary position. In total, we probably put in an average of between 20 to 30 hours extra per week for the last 7 months, and would receive about 50 ish dollars per hour in overtime pay. So it could be worth an enormous amount of compensation. There are about 45 apprentices that could vouch for these details if need be. Any advice?",1

The manager says I should just take the test again until I receive the highest score but I don't believe I should have to do that.
From what I understood tip pools are supposed to be 100 percent equally shared. Is this legal?",1

Fiance getting kicked out of sober house.,26,dq07m9,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dq07m9/fiance_getting_kicked_out_of_sober_house/,18,1572616343.0,"Richmond, Virginia

My fiance is getting kicked out of her sober house. She found a bottle of oxycodone pills with a diminishing supply. She confronted the man who is running the sober house, I'll call him E. In the contract she signed, and as is custom in sober houses, she requested that he take a drug test. He refused, said she was high and has told her she has 24 hours to leave. He refused to drug test her to clarify this. 

During her stay there he has also insisted that she be house secretary or he'd kick her out. This was not in the contract. 
He also made her purchase soap, shower cleaner and toilet paper, or face at $30 fine. Failing that she would have 24 hours to leave. 
He made her clean the house. Again, not in the contract. 

Now, as I'm writing this, he's called the cops to get her out tonight. 

I know all this because we've been video chatting all night. 

It's in the contract that shes not a legal resident. But she pays rent and has receipts. Does he have to give her 30 days to evict her? 
Whe she leaves for work tomorrow, can he take her things and put them by the curb? Would that be illegal? 
Also, she did not sign her legal name to contract, does that nullify it? She's transgender. 

Edit-cops have said that he has to go through the legal eviction process. 
Secondary question-does she have grounds to sue? Especially since there's literally no way in hell he's going to give her the $300 she paid as a security deposit. 
Is there any way to stop him from running a siber house? Some one in active addiction shouldn't be running a sober house for people honestly trying to get clean. While there, he's done none of the normal sober house things like curfews or mandatory meetings.

Edit, new information-E doesn't own the house.",26
"Unprepared lawyer not offering refund or issuing motion, and is now ignoring emails",2,dq795h,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dq795h/unprepared_lawyer_not_offering_refund_or_issuing/,5,1572657377.0,"Hi everyone.  I need some advice on how to handle this situation.  Apologies for the length, I put a tl;dr at the end, and thank you in advance for your guidance.

Basically, I hired a lawyer to represent me in New York for a small claims matter.  I was being sued and although I knew the claim was bogus, I wanted to make sure that I was represented well as I had a lot of money on the line.

The local bar association had a list of lawyers they refer people to, so I called one of them and was told he could represent me for two court appearances at a flat rate.  I scheduled a phone consultation, which lasted maybe five minutes.  I was told I was in the right and to bring a copy of my agreement to court.  I asked if I could counter sue for my legal fees, and was told that he would file a motion after I won, that it was very simple.  I followed up via email asking if more information was needed, and expressed that I was concerned about the claimant lying to win the case, and was told that if anything else was needed from me, someone would reach out.

Well, no one reached out, and I didn't hear a peep from them until I asked where the lawyer could meet me the day of the court date.

I came equipped with more information than I was asked to bring just in case.  He looked it over and seemed pretty confident about everything.  Then our case was called up and it went downhill from there.  First, there was nothing submitted to the court saying I was going to be represented, which annoyed the judge from the start.  Then, my lawyer looked extremely unprepared, like he was cramming for a test.  The claimant began lying and my lawyer fumbled over what to ask during the questioning, so the judge said to let me speak as ""it might go better.""  And lastly, the lawyer forgot that I wasn't countersuing for monies owed to me, so the judge called him out on that.

I was in shock because it seemed like a bit of a train wreck, and I honestly felt like I could have represented myself way better.  After we were finished, I felt like the lawyer shifted blame towards me for how it went, stating that it would have been nice to have seen the agreement ahead of time, even though I did exactly what I was told, and no one bothered to meet with me or reach out to me for anything in advance.

After mulling it over, I sent an email to the lawyer with constructive feedback and said I didn't feel I got what I paid for.  I also asked for a copy of the hours billed.  It took the lawyer several days to even acknowledge it, and I got a lengthy email, stating that he felt it went well and he did his job.  He also seemed to shift blame towards me again, that I could have gotten better representation had I paid him more (I was only quoted one price), and he could have reviewed the agreement had I met him earlier in the day before court began (no one told me he was available much earlier, or I would have been there as well).  There was no offer of a refund, especially for half of the retainer paid for the court appearance I wasn't represented for.

Thankfully, I got a notice from the court stating that the case was dismissed.  I followed up with the lawyer's office, asking about the motion he mentioned to recoup my fees.  I heard nothing, so I followed up again.  Still nothing.  I am trying to get everything in writing so I have documentation, and I am afraid my lawyer is ghosting me to avoid doing anything with me further.

Is there anything I can do here to recoup my money, or at least half of it for the court date I wasn't represented for?

**tl;dr - Hired lawyer to represent me for two court dates and was told he could file a motion to recoup expenses if I won.  Although my lawyer came across as very unprepared, the case was dismissed in my favor.  After sending an email providing constructive feedback to the lawyer, my lawyer didn't offer a refund, and is now ignoring my emails requesting a motion be issued to recoup expenses.**",2

Location- Philadelphia 

I'm writing this to get advice for my friend and really have no legal knowledge. We need to know what to expect as far as the hearing and most importantly what to do to prevent losing her home, the house she grew up in. (She is now a senior)

She received the notice about 15 days ago (although they tried to serve her back in August but failed).  The hearing is next week and we had just wrote a letter to request continuance -faxed to Judge and opposing party.

She cannot afford a $275/hr attorney and cannot get help from community legal assistance due to this uncommon case, as they say they do not have the expertise.

The back story and reason for delay:

January of 2018, her mom died in the house fire. Since then, she has been trying to fix her other home in order to sell and move into the property in dispute. Apparently it has not been quick enough and through the suggestion of one slick real estate agent, neighbors got together to use this against her. 

Asking for continuance due to a major car accident, and medical leave due to a fall (all this year). 

Is there any chance she can win without a lawyer? She will be prepared with repair plans if continuance is denied.

thanks for any advice.",94

 I moved into my aunts 2nd home 2 years ago with only 2 things asked of me. If I payed the bills and cleaned it up I could live there rent free. It needed cleaning because the person it belonged to passed away and was given to the aunt. 
In 2018 aunt went bankrupt and asked if I could give her some money until they got the bankruptcy settled. I said sure because I understood the struggle. They went to court and have not been in bankruptcy since January 2019. So I stopped paying a monthly fee.  The aunt still expected money but every time I brought it up she mentioned that it was rent. So now I had to pay a monthly fee, continue putting money into the house and pay the bills. Most renters don’t spend their own money to replace things that have been broken, mow and upkeep the lawn, redo the garage, paint the house etc. 
 I let the aunt know I couldn’t afford the amount because she wanted 800 a month for rent, spend 50 every 2 weeks for lawn maintenance, repairs on house (no idea the costs) bills that total 500. 

When I said I was moving out, she went to another family member and said I was refusing to pay rent and so I got a text from the other family member saying I was a pos and that I’m ruining the family.  Then the aunt threatened to sue me for unpaid rent and “damages”. There were no damages to the house and in fact many repairs I made with my own money. I took pictures of all parts of the house and left.

Things that she neglected to tell me:

There was a roach infestation

She told my bio dad where I lived and he showed up several times (very abusive man) 
The mower we could use to not pay lawn matainance was broken and we were in a HOA so had to mow every 2 weeks. (Didn’t tell me it was broken or about hoa) 

I had no renters agreement. We never signed one or made one up. 

The bills were not in my name ever. They were in the aunts name. 

If damages happen after, Will the pictures I took be enough to prove I didn’t cause any? 

I should have signed an agreement but I was 19 when I moved in and thought my aunt was helping a young college woman out with cheapish living. I need help if there’s any chance they could sue me.",1

We met in our mid twenties and it’s been a year since we separated. She had a baby from a previous relationship who I raised as my own. When we initially split, I blocked my ex on all social media platforms and blocked her number. Every conversation was toxic. This upset her, and she stated that if I would not have a relationship with her, I can not see the child. I’ve literally raised this kid even when the biological bloke was uninterested and basically had to be coerced into fatherhood. He initially wanted the baby aborted.  I miss my son with every ounce of my being and have reached out through email to persuade my ex to continue my relationship with him. Even if it’s just once a month. My son went through a period of asking for me everyday as disclosed to me by my ex. We were literally ripped away from one another with no explanation and no closure for me and the child. I went to one of his soccer games and after the game, my son ran up to me and would not let me go, he’s 8 now. My ex has lead me along saying to email her to arrange a meeting, only I email and get no response. So I drove to her house, at night, when I know he’s asleep to reason with my ex. Also, because I don’t want to upset my son. I have gone over twice over the past year. The last visit I was in tears pleading with her and she went on and on about how she didn’t want it to be this way. She told me to email her. I left with this new hope and sent her the email to arrange a time to meet (I was fully prepared to say goodbye to my son and give him the toys I bought for him, which he still asks for his toys) She never responded to the email. Last night after trick or treating with my nephew. I again began to miss my son and so I went to her house to reason. She threatened to call the police. I stayed on her porch for five minutes before throwing in the towel. As I was leaving the police pulled up and I explained to them that I was leaving and explained I was there to work out a situation to see my son and gave them the background story. They seemed empathetic and gave me advice on family court, an option that is not open to me because he’s not biologically mine nor did I adopt him. So legally no standing. After she called the police, I pretty much got the closure I needed. As much as I love my son, no one is worth my livelihood. I believe that my ex is now pursuing a restraining order. Which is absolutely unnecessary as her calling the police was enough of a message for me. I’m a professional woman and am worried that if she follows through with this, it will reflect on my record. 

I will no longer attempt to see my son or reach out to my ex. I learned the hard way.

"Teacher getting harassed for pregnancy by administrators including HR representative, but not unionized.

Short version: I’m a younger, pregnant female teacher at a charter high school in California. I was interviewed three time from non-administrative staff members about a single time I reprimanded a student, who isn’t on my roster, in my class for insulting and belittling me in front of other students. Basically, kid said he hated the way I and all Americans pronounced things and then when he refused to leave my classroom, apologized on his knees in an accent to further his point. So, I told him to get out. This was beginning of October. 

He complains to multiple staff members and now I get interviewed three times about this two weeks later. I complain to my HR department (one person) because they requested That I be interviewed. Both the HR rep and the office manager who interviewed me say it’s because I’m pregnant that I was being sensitive to the student’s comment. I say this is harassment because I’m being targeted by the student and HR and director of the school who also requested that I be interviewed. So I file a grievance report. 

During my follow up on Tuesday this week, I was told, again, that I’m being “too uptight” and “overly sensitive” because of my age (29) and pregnancy, my report was inappropriate and “petty” and that I may be “reviewed to see if I’m a good fit for the school”.  Also, I was told to shut up multiple times during the follow up. It was two hours long. 

During today’s morning staff meeting, the director explicitly called me out for being pregnant and used exact phrases from the follow up including “uptight” and “defensive”. Also, I’m one of four female teachers out of 14 teachers at this high school. 
Also, I’m a new teacher. Just started in August. 

I’m not unionized, but I want legal action now. What do I do or go?",0

While my balcony itself has not been worked on, I have talked to tenants who's balconies have been worked on, and they were all told they had to move out, as the balconies were unsafe.

Today I arrived home to find many construction workers at the complex, tearing down our gym, common area, and erecting more scaffolding around the building. I spoke with an employee who told me they have just 'found some concerns', and have to do some repair work in these areas. I tried to get some answers as to what was going on, but no one would give me a straight response.

This has been a long list of issues with this complex, as the apartments are new within the last 2 years, and the original builder made multiple mistakes that the complex has had to come back and fix over the past two years.

I want to move out, both due to the fact that there will now be construction going all full time for the foreseeable future, and also that I am no longer comfortable know they are finding structural issues with the building that I currently live in. 

Rent is due today, but I am hesitant to pay them the full amount with all that is going on. I would like to move out ASAP. but it also is not inexpensive to move between having to take time off and renting trucks to move all my items. So I have two questions:

1) Would it be advisable for me to withhold rent until I get an answer as to what is going on?

2) I am going to look for apartments ASAP, but would my current apartment complex be liable for paying for my move?",1
Foreign Car Towed (Dallas County),0,dqb3s6,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dqb3s6/foreign_car_towed_dallas_county/,0,1572674251.0,"Hey guys, 

New account but not throaway because I wanted a new username anyway.

So all of this happened in Dallas, TX.

TLDR: My -non american- car was towed from inside of my apartment complex without any valid reason, what can I do to avoid this in the future?

&#x200B;

So, it's a long one but I guess I need to go detailed since this has been kinda weird.

For the record, I am mexican, working as an engineer here, with all my paperwork (car, work visa, etc) up to date.

I drove from my parents place in mexico to dallas a couple of weeks ago with my brother's car because I needed it for a few things. No problem whatsoever.

I have private parking in my apartment complex,  and a couple of days after I was here I got a sticker on my windshield, saying that my car didn't have registration, and I had 10 days or so to get it. I assume this is the blue sticker that cars from texas have. Now, this didn't make any sense since my car is not american, so I talked to my landlord and they told me not to worry, they probably were confused, and that as long as I have my parking permit (which I do) everything should be fine. I would also like to add that I moved here last year and I had my own, mexican car here without a problem for around 3 months.

So earlier this week my car was towed, my landlord right away asked me if I was parked in an illegal spot, and no, I was parked where I usually parked all the time. They said they couldn't help me because apparently once they take a car, it's up to them to release it, even tho I understand that in the end my landlord is the one that gives the OK to tow the cars, and also the ones that have the contract with CWS.

So I call CWS, and they stated that my car didn't have registration, that's why it was towed, I explain to them that what they are saying doesn't apply to my car, and they didn't really know what to respond, they told me that they didn't have any internet since the day before so they couldn't help me right away, they would call me later.

SO, I get tired of waiting, and just went directly to the office to see what was the problem and they said that, my car didn't have a registration, and that I was warned a few days before with a sticker. I told them that my car does have a (mexican) registration, it's just not a sticker like you would get from a car in texas.

After this they told me that my car did have a registration, but one of my plates had a 17, so of course it had to be expired since it's not a 19. This isn't the case, that 17 it's simply part of a sticker that my local government gives out. They stuck with this excuse for a while until they said that I should get a permit to drive in texas when I'm here for more than 30 days. I did some research and that's simply not true, according to the gov page I, as a mexican national, with mexican driver's license and with a mexican car, can use that specific car for up to 90 days without a problem (I have done this in the past, never had an issue). Even if it was one month I crossed the border on the 14th of october, hasn't even been a month since then.

Honestly, it was a long debate because they kept changing the goal posts, everytime they told me why it was towed, I explained why was that wrong, they came up with a new one, in the end they stuck with the registration thing.

To be honest at this point it felt completely like my car was just being held hostage because I'm a foreigner, one of them at some point said that she didn't make the rules, that I was talking as if she sat, in a table, with some other ""rule making peeps"" and made the legislation, and that wasn't the case, she was just being paid $12 an hour (????) to be there listening me.

In the end I got tired and I was just ready to pay, but of course they didn't have system so they couldn't take my credit card, it needed to be **cash only.** So I go get the cash and come back, and before leaving I asked one of the other ladies, okay, this happens, shit happens, but what do I need to do for this to not happen again? And she basically said well you should only have your registation up to date. I responded that yes, it is up to date, and she just told me oh cool then you shouldn't have any problems, and here I am, dumbfounded, asking then **why the fuck am I here??** She didn't say anything at all after that but yeah you get the idea.

I can see that I fucked up by not calling the towing company when I got the sticker, I thought that talking to my landlord would be enough, since they are the ones that pull the trigger, right? However, I can't shake the feeling that I was simply scammed, because of the whole ""no system, cash only"" thing, and also reading around in r/Dallas I can see that the towing companies are getting kinda out of control here and I'm not sure I'm in the best fighting ground since, even with every single piece of paperwork up to date, in the end I'm a foreigner.

SO, my sweet reddit law gurus, what do you make of this?  Do I have any other way to defend myself from this if it happens again?

Thanks a lot reddit.",0

We have two kids together. It meets--I think--the legal definition of separation IN California. We live apart. I am living with my parents. She has remained in the family home that we bought together.

When she first said she wanted to be separated, she asked for ""space"" and that's all. It was implied that it'd be a temporary separation, and that I'd move in with my parents on a temporarily basis.... 

She arranged for marriage counseling. We had one session. It went as expected. She said some things that were patently untrue to use as ammunition against me. I have a strong feeling that the therapist saw right through her BS.

The week after I moved out, she changed all the locks on the house. After notifying me of this via text, she also told me all my stuff was in the driveway and that if I didn't come pick it up now, a thrift store moving van would take it for donation. 

She's already said she wants a divorce. I want to move back in, and possibly try to work on our marriage. I think with some work, she can drop this impulse (that's what I think it is) of wanting to separate, and we can be a family again. 

I say impulse because I believe it's stress-induced; lately she's taken on a new job and she just can't handle stress as well as she thinks she can.

The house is a mess. The kids (ages 5 and 2.5) keep asking for me to come back home. I see them three days a week at my parents'. I could live in the office if I moved back in. 

I'm asking, what are my rights? Can I demand to move back in? I don't make enough to afford my own place, and that's my home as much as it's hers! They're my kids too! They want their dad.

How to legally burn an employer to the ground?,0,dqdoh8,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dqdoh8/how_to_legally_burn_an_employer_to_the_ground/,12,1572686763.0,"Hey all so I could go into it and will briefly explain the current situation. I am already going to take legal action to get what I am owed. Right now I am looking for advice, tips, comments, suggestions of things I can do legally to ruin my current employer.

I know karma can be a bitch and I should just go on with my life, but I have been put through the paces with my current boss that I need to get some revenge.

So the story / parameters of the situation:

I work in sales selling say renovations for people’s homes. I get paid a base salary as well as a commission % per sale and a year end bonus based on sales goals. I get paid my commission 50 50 the first half at the time of sale and the second half after the installation of the product. Over the last year I have sold 1.3 million dollars worth of product. Only 600K has been installed. 

I came to find out my small company was not financially doing well so the owner sold 2/3 of the company to another company. Then for the last 4 weeks I have not been paid. He called me to say in the last 2 weeks I did not sell enough to justify what I was going to get paid. I told him my contract stated I was owed base and commission and mileage reimbursement. He said sorry I cannot pay you any of this and wanted me to keep working for no wages.

I told him that I could take legal action and he said good luck the old company that was sold is just a bunch of debt and collectors trying to get it. The new company that I technically work for does not owe me what I did for the old company. I never signed a new contract or was ever told of a change to my compensation structure.  At this point after numerous months of lying and downright wrong behavior I am done with this company.

That being said I have a great opportunity with another company doing the exact same role. I still have my current (if you can call it that) employers laptop with hundreds of leads and sales info that is valuable to the new company. I also have their cell phone. 

So I am asking what can I do to 1 prosper with this info in my new company but more importantly burn my new company to the ground. For example call my clients that no systems have been installed and tell them to ask for their money back, write negative review on their website, etc.

Please people of Reddit give me some advice. Oh also I am located in VA.

[CA][Landlord/Tenant] Security Deposit Dispute,2,dq7nzu,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dq7nzu/calandlordtenant_security_deposit_dispute/,11,1572659172.0,"Summer of 2018 we moved into a townhome. Security deposit was 2x rent. Upon moving in, we requested and received approval (in writing) from the landlord to remove the mirrors on the 1st floor in the livingroom/dining room area. Professionals were hired to remove the mirrors, patch drywall, and paint white. Came out looking spectacular. The upstairs walls were received with a bunch of defects, holes, scratches, etc. There are pictures from our initial walkthrough.

The landlord did not furnish any keys to the front door (main entry and egress was through the garage, so didn't seem like a big deal at the time) which was equipped with a rather ancient lock. Deadbolt worked, but the whole thing looked like it could fall apart if you looked at it wrong. When we would go to the pool, we would just leave the front door unlocked as the townhome was directly adjacent to the pool. One day, upon returning from the pool, we realized the front door handle mechanism had entirely failed and would not open. We contacted the landlord and he texted us a electronic pincode lock as a suggested replacement and just told us to buy and replace the existing lock, and deduct the cost from our subsequent month's rent, which we did. - Cal. Civ. Code § 1941.3

We had our final inspection with the landlords 18 days ago. At that point in time, they did not bring up any concerns in regards to the condition of the townhome nor were we furnished, verbally or in writing, with any reasons for which they would be withholding any portion of our security deposit. Cal. Civ. Code § 1950.5 (f)(2)

Three (3) days ago, the landlord sent us an email stating:

""Also of course you did paint the downstairs  and thank you for that also, but because of that we were forced to paint  the upstairs to match cost : $575, and the front door that the lock was  replaced and handle had to refinish and pant all around that cost:  $312.""

And that they would be postmarking a check for the full amount less $800. The check has yet to arrive.

We have not responded to their communications in any way such as not to introduce the possibility of accord and subsequent satisfaction.

To the best of my knowledge, the fact that the upstairs, which was returned in the same condition as received, not matching the downstairs, which we, with their written approval spent $2.6k to improve, does not ""match"" the downstairs, is not a valid justification for which the landlord can withhold any portion of the security deposit. Per Cal. Civ. Code § 1941.3 (a)(1), it is the responsibility of the landlord or their agents to install/maintain main swinging entry doors and locking mechanisms. Considering the fact that the landlord shirked these responsibilities, I fail to see how any issues arising from the replacement of the front door lock, per their request, which did not damage the door beyond the state it was already in, also be justifiably deducted from the security deposit.

Would I be correct in the interpretation of Cal Com Code § 3311 that depositing the check, if/when it may arrive, could potentially release them from any further obligation and future remedied to recoup the remainder of the security deposit?

The 21 day repayment period ends on the 4th of November, which, if I'm reading Cal. Civ. Code § 1950.5 correctly, would expose them to liability totaling 2x the security deposit ($15,600) + potential damages.

Based on the facts of the situation, how sound is our position, what should our next steps be in regards to notifying the landlord that we will not be accepting the terms, and expect the return of the deposit in full, etc.

If any additional information pertaining to the above would assist in a response, please let me know.",2

I pointed it out to my manager and he had some talks with HR and he's acting like they messed up but he basically put it like this, whenever they calculated the offer letter they were going off of 80 hour pay intervals whenever we only work 77 hour checks (bi-weekly) with 4 hours of that being OT. The way it was explained to me in the beginning was that we work less but the OT we get equals out to a regular 80 hours.

Now that things are looking bad my manager kind of back tracked and said that the OT hours aren't counted into our salary so I'm actually only making 29k something a year and this raise is bringing me up to just under 31,000. Does this sound right? I thought if I have a signed offer letter saying I make xyz/per year that thats what I would be getting paid for.

Teen Stalker Help,23,dpzfnb,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dpzfnb/teen_stalker_help/,9,1572611086.0,"Hi this post is not for me but for a friend I want to help. This started about a month ago at the Restaurant we work at. It is similar to a Chick Fil A or Panera with the fact that customers come to the counter and we bring the food out to them. He is a 25 year old college student who came up to order food just like any other customer. He came in every Sunday for about 3 weeks however neither I nor my friend found this unusual  because a lot of customers come in routinely. My friend and I are 15& 16 years old and this is our first job. She takes his order most of the time because she does register. I didn’t note it at the time but he would come up a couple times every visit ordering small items like a small fry then a small milkshake. He casually mentioned how he had seen her last week too and asked her what days she worked. He seemed normal and as though he was just being friendly. So she told him what days she worked. Sure enough he is back the following Sunday yet this time he does something different. When she brought his food out to him he asked her for her phone number and Instagram. Before she always saw him a nice guy but now she realized the 25 year old was most likely hitting on her. She told him “I have to bring this food out” and left without telling him. The Sunday after this he is back. She is creeped out from him because he must’ve been able to tell she is a minor when he asked for her number. So she does her best to avoid him. She has to restock the cups and while she is doing so he walked up to her and dropped her a note. There was no conversation though. The note had his name, number, and Instagram. She DMed him later saying she is 15. He replied saying that she did not seem 15 but he was 25. Instead of stopping contact he continued saying he would like to hang out sometime outside of work. She did not reply to this message. We gather from his public insta that he is an exchange student from Spain attending the local college. Then things get a lot more creepy. A week later my friend got off the bus and was walking to her corner house. On the intersecting street a car drove slowly by and she could immediately recognize him watching her with a grin. She was all by herself and he was wearing glasses and a cap. He drove away before seeing her go into her house. This happened the next day as well but instead of driving by the car was waiting. Right on time. He was wearing a hat and sunglasses once again. This means that 1) he must’ve known where she lived. She commonly rode her bike to the restaurant so we assume he followed her home one day after her shift. And 2) that he knew what time she got off the bus/out of school. This is as far as it has gotten but I need advice on what she should do. She is worried about getting her parents involved because they will turn to the police.

How to file insurance claim against shopping mall for personal injury?,0,dqdhpr,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dqdhpr/how_to_file_insurance_claim_against_shopping_mall/,4,1572685746.0,"Recently had an incident where my child suffered a minor injury at the shopping mall due to unsafe conditions. I filed an injury report with Mall security, and also contacted mall management.

 Management was initially very responsive and apologized for the incident and said they would try to improve safety. I asked about getting compensation for doctors fees and pain and suffering, and they said they would escalate the issue, but I have not heard since. I think they ignoring me now to avoid any claims. 

Is it possible to find out the insurance info of the mall by myself so I can file a claim directly? They are part of a big chain if it matters. 

BTW tried talking to some lawyers already, they all agree I have a case and the mall should pay, but there is not enough money in it for them to get involved. So I am on my own.

[PA] Is a lawyer recommended for an appeal?,1,dqajwe,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dqajwe/pa_is_a_lawyer_recommended_for_an_appeal/,3,1572671813.0,"Long story short, my vehicle was not repaired correctly by an auto body shop and I had to take it somewhere else to be repaired. The first shop refused to pay the second shop so I had to pay out of pocket and then took the first shop to small claims court to reimburse me the $1200.

In small claims court, I guess we took too long with our “opening statements”, and the magistrate had other cases. She cut myself and the defendant off, asked us for our packets of information, and said we’d receive a decision in the mail. I didn’t have a chance to really explain anything in my packet.

Judgment was decided for the defendant, the body shop, even though I provided email documentation of the shop manager lying, pictures of the damage that still existed after I left the shop, and more. However I didn’t get a chance to explain all of that in small claims court because she told us we were taking too long and rushed us out.

I plan on appealing the case, but it’s proving near impossible to find any kind of lawyer that is interested in taking a $1,200 small claims civil complaint case. Most are just trying to get me off the phone because it’s not worth their time. However, most things I’m finding online are saying you’re definitely going to want a lawyer for the appeal, especially if you’re the plaintiff.

Any advice from anyone who’s done this before? Should I get a lawyer or just prepare all the same information but present it in a quicker way? It’s somewhat hard trying to squeeze four months of information, emails, and pictures, into a few minute explanation though. Yes, the whole process with the shop took four months instead of four days.

I've moved twice, since defaulting in 2014, but I don't believe I've been sued yet.  It seems like most resources are geared towards people who probably didnt sign a promissory note or it's some kind of fraud.  Personally, I might have- but I also failed to retain any documentation on my end to know for sure.  My questions are basic procedural ones:

* How do I find out if there is a judgement against me?  

* If there isn't, how much longer do I have to ignore calls before the statute of limitations runs out?  I'm only *pretty sure* that they're calling about a private, unsecured loan.  My credit report shows the suspected loan as ""Loan type: student loan / Owner: Individual"" and lists my University as the contact.

* If I accept a call, refuse to admit ownership of the debt, provide current mailing address, and ask for debt validation over the phone, what can I expect to receive in the mail?  I assume a phone call doesn't carry the same legal weight as a certified letter and I'll only receive a bill.

* If they send a bill, is the ""I need more information"" template linked [here](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/what-should-i-do-when-a-debt-collector-contacts-me-en-1695/) sufficient?

* If I send this kind of letter via certified mail, what can I expect to receive in return/what is the legal standard to properly verify debt?

* If I continue to go full ostrich, will it drop off of my credit reports in 2021?

Yeah, I know it's shitty, but I'll be damned if I'm going to pay the over $6000 I assume they are pursuing.  I want proof of the amount, and I want them to demonstrate that they have their ducks in a row / a winnable case before I consider breaking silence.  And even then, I have no intention of admitting I owe the debt until I'm sued for it and take my chances with a judge.  How stupid of an idea is that?",0

Requesting a custody move out of state with children that I am currently barred custody from in Tennessee.,1,dqag50,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dqag50/requesting_a_custody_move_out_of_state_with/,1,1572671367.0,"Background: 
In April of this year I voluntarily checked myself into a mental health treatment facility to deal with PTSD. Prior to this I had 50/50 custody of my kids but had them 100% of the time since I was unable to work and their father is an asshole. When I left the facility, I was served a restraining order from my exhusband stating that I was a physically and emotionally abusive mother and had threatened to kill him and my children. This was done because I had the intention to relocate my children out of state after finishing treatment and he didn’t want that.

CPS was notified and chose to not even open a case since HE had the history of violence and making false abuse claims during our divorce. The judge however did not agree with them and granted the order for 12 months, giving me very minimal supervised visitation. His reasoning was that if I was suicidal, I would most definitely kill my kids. Yes, he said that. 

The OOP is open to modification in another county where our custody is based. I spoke with a few custody lawyers about immediately filing to have it dismissed and the move approved. The general agreement among them was that my best chance was to move by myself, get established with job, housing and mental health care, and file for the move when the restraining order naturally expires and our 50/50 custody goes back in place. 

I’ve gotten myself established, am in great health physically and mentally, it has been just over 6 months and I am done waiting to get my kids back. Ex-in-laws have cut off my contact with the children and I know they are not being taken care of beyond the basics of being fed junk food and babysat by a TV. The last time I spoke to them 6 weeks ago my daughter(5) expressed regret that her father hadn’t died after being hospitalized for an unnamed illness. 

I can easily procure documentation that I’m stable from my therapist and psychiatrist, I have a job involving quite a bit of responsibility that I manage well,  and I have a massive family base here with me. 

Is waiting really my best option? If so, what can I do in the meantime to ensure my success when we do go to court?",1

I was released shortly after that and since then I haven't had any issues or similar instances. 

My question is, now having been mentally stable for a couple of years, I am interested in purchasing a firearm for personal safety. I have a suspicion that the previous mental health issues could be an issue in that, but I am not really sure.  I found [this](https://lawcenter.giffords.org/mental-health-reporting-in-kansas/) which has a few statutes that I am not sure apply. 

I also requested the records from the county from that time so I could see if it said anything about restricting firearm access. They didn't explicitly mention anything about firearms. Just seems like normal involuntary commitment stuff. They also mentioned that some documents were sealed. There were 2, one ended requesting a continuance (presumably to the 2nd document) I am not sure if only the first or both are sealed.

They have told me that it’s been hard for our boy to get treatment because most of the time, step-mom has to be the one to take him to his appointments, but since she’s not a bio-parent, they have experienced hurdles. Because of this, step-mom petitioned for a step-parent adoption. At the time of that, we were all on awful terms and I believed them to be doing it out of spite to hurt me and cut me out of my sons life completely.

I suggested she just petition the court for legal guardianship, but they say the court won’t do it because neither of our sons natural parents are dead or unfit; the only way they would see it necessary would be if something were to happen to my ex-husband.

Earlier this year I signed up for the Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account (DCFSA) through my work after a qualifying life event (had a baby). This benefit lets you contribute pre-tax dollars to an account that you can then use for expenses such as daycare. Yesterday I received an email from my benefits center stating that they failed the annual non-discrimination testing required by the IRS and have now reduced my total max contribution by half. Financially this means that I am now responsible for $800 in additional tax in 2019.

I reached out to my benefits team to understand more and they state that I am considered a highly compensated employee (people making more than 120k per IRS) and that because our company skews younger in demographics (and most people straight out of school aren't having babies), they always fail discrimination testing for this benefit. To rectify they just lower all highly compensated employee contribution amounts come Q4.

They have explicitly stated that they know this is an almost guaranteed outcome but provide absolutely no documentation or warning of this possible outcome prior to signing up for the benefit. If I had known this was even a slight possibility, I would have signed up through my spouse's plan whos company demographics skew much older. My spouse can not now sign up for this benefit as there is no current qualified life event.

Do I have any rights? I feel like my company tricked me into a benefit that isn't as advertised. I feel robbed of $800.

I need some advise on this situation. My group and I rented out a 300CC ATV, this was on our contract that we signed for. One of our friends got injured badly during this trip - within the first 15 minutes of our reservation, he drove his ATV over a steep sand dune, broke his wrist, collapsed his lung & damaged two vertebrae on his spinal cord. He was in the ICU for a week and had 2 surgeries. 

When we returned our ATVs back to the rental area, they suddenly informed us that we actually had the 450CC. We were all very surprised and was confused on why they didn't tell us about this upgrade before we started the reservation and the precautions of this much faster ATV. 

Since our injured friend's ATV fell down the sand dune, the ATV was at a total loss, they emailed us that we had to either pay $3500 to fix the salvage vehicle OR to pay $5500 to own it.   

My question is - can our friend sue this company on failure to inform us about the upgrade to the 450CC ATV when we wanted/signed for the 300CC one? And are we still liable to pay for the damages on the ATV when we were only contractually liable for the 300CC ATV?

Is there a similar way to do that in the states or some kind of consumer law office for such cases? What can I do as an EU citizen living in EU. Has anyone experience in a similar cases?

I notified Human Resources and Payroll reached out to me. They wanted to use my vacation leave that I was waiting to be paid out for (36.23 hours, equivalent to $875 gross earnings) to reduce the total overpayment. 

They are saying that they will submit a ""net"" based on the total gross earnings owed and let me know what I owe them in the end. My questions are:

1) Is the state of California allowed to take this overpayment from me when it was their own fault that they didn't terminate me correctly and on time? I assume so, but I know California's Section 221 of the California Labor Code ""specifies that it is unlawful for an employer to collect or receive any part of wages already paid to an employee.""

3) I told them I would prefer not to use the $875 to reduce the total overpayment because this entire process is confusing already and I wanted two separate transactions to wrap my head around it.

Unknown Apartment Entry [Colorado],1,dq8z5h,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dq8z5h/unknown_apartment_entry_colorado/,2,1572665003.0,"So I live in a ""luxory"" apartment complex in Colorado. We recently had a snow storm and it got really cold. At 8:30PM on Tuesday, I heard a large bang that sounded like it came from my neighbors apartment. At first I thought it may have been a gunshot but doubt that that was the case. 

2 hours later, a guy comes knocking at my door asking if he can look around. I said absolutely not. He claimed to be my downstairs neighbor and that water was leaking into his apartment. I looked around and confirmed that nothing in my apartment was leaking and communicated this back to the individual. 

I wrote an email to the front office who later confirmed that this person was genuine and not some non-resident trying to gain access to my apartment for unknown reasons.

On Thursday, almost a full two days later, as I entered my apartment from getting back from work I immediately noticed that there was a pair of black latex gloves sitting above my recycling bin. I don't own any such gloves so I immediately put them in a bag and tried to communicate with someone who works in the building. I left a voicemail with maintenance and an email with the front office.

I have no idea where the gloves came from and that's the problem. My huntch is that maintenance dicided to come in and check for the previously mentioned leak. The issue is they left without leaving any notice what so ever that they had entered my unit besides the evidence (gloves).

For all ruitine maintenance they are required per the contract to provide 24 written notice. In emergencies they can enter for such circumstances but I would think would be required to leave a notice of entry upon departure. There was not a note left. For ruitine maintenance they always leave a note behind.

It's hard to justify it as emergency maintenance though when it took them over a day to enter the unit. If it was then they should have entered Wednesday and if so provided me notice.

The fact that no notice was left is a huge concern to me regardless of if it was routine or an ""emergency"" because I have no idea who entered my unit, what they were actually doing or whatever. 

My fear, though unlikely, is that if it wasn't maintenance, that there was an illegal entry for whatever reason and that would warrant the need to file a police report. I am giving them 24 hours to respond before I jump to such conclusions though and if it was maintance will have a stern conversation about letting me know when they enter my unit.

Is there anything I am missing here? Am I making the right calls? Are they allowed to just enter my unit without prior or post notice for any reason or claim something is an ""emergency"" and then wait over 24 hours to enter and still not tell me?

I am very irretaded by the incident and if it was maintance then a note should have been left.

Please note that my door is fob access and it would be unlikely to have been picked in the traditional sense. Also, there appears that no items were stolen.


Follow up... I now have additional evidence to suspect that it was  maintenance and not someone else. The chair on my balcony was moved (and so was the chair of my same floor neighbors). This means they might have been looking at the balcony as a source of the leak from the snow that had landed there.

None the less. A note should have been left.",1

I’m a college student and I signed a lease in July to move into an apartment off campus with 2 other people. Initially it was 3 of us. Then one roommate brought in her significant other to leave with us and her dog later on. We agreed to these as we saw no issue in having them there. The one roommate claims the leasing office told her it was ok for the significant other to live there, but does not have this in writing. However, our lease dictates that everyone who lives there must be on the lease, subleasing is prohibited, and we have a no-pet clause in the lease. Rent was split unevenly with two of us paying 1/3 and the other two in the same room each paying half of 1/3 of a share. 

Due to a number of financial and mental health reasons I made the decision to initiate the process of removing myself from the lease. I informed them of this and that I will be finding them a new roommate. I moved as much of my stuff as I could out immediately and intended on returning for the rest (about 5 medium-sized items), but was immediately contacted by one roommate who was very angry I didn’t remove all of it at once. 

I sent them 19 people who were interested in the apartment starting November 1, 2019, but they chose someone for the month of December (who I didn’t send them) instead. I signed the roommate release for myself in October and was informed that it would not be in effect until the other two signed it, but I did forfeit my share of the security deposit that day. The roommates claim they couldn’t release me from the roommate agreement/lease because they didn’t qualify financially for the apartment if they did. At this point, someone who was not on the lease was living there and not paying their full share who could be added and therefore, they would qualify again. 

I pointed out all of this and was told I was a liar, ridiculous, and that I had no proof by one roommate. I pointed out that I had originally intended to pay my share of November’s rent. However, due to the fact that I had a number of individuals who were willing to sign the lease and move in immediately, I didn't deem this necessary. 

This morning I received two messages with a threat of legal action, which to be honest I was prepared for. Would me initiating the process of being removed from the lease, providing them with the names and numbers of individuals who could replace me immediately before rent was due, and/or the fact that they have another person they are refusing to sign onto the lease be enough to make my case as to why I shouldn’t be paying this? Or does my name on still being on the lease trump all? 

TLDR; Roommates are threatening to take me to small claims over 1 month of rent which I initially agreed to pay. I found a number of people who were willing to move in and sign the lease immediately. They chose someone who couldn't sign until December. They also have another person not on the lease living there who could easily sign the lease as well to meet the financial requirements of the apartment. Is this enough to make my case in court as to why I shouldn't have to pay or does my name still on the lease, trump all?",0

Okay, i guess I am in a bit of pickle here and may be able to just let sleeping dogs lie.

An acquaintance (someone I was Friendly with past 4 years) of mine was scrapping a vehicle. I found it was being scrapped so I asked him if I could swap my wheels for his as I had the same vehicle as he. [Scrap yard won't take a vehicle without wheels so he needed mine].

I said I would ""pay him some cash"" and he said ""the scrappers are taking it tomorrow, go ahead and swap them"" 

I confirmed I would and then the conversation changed subject.

Next day I get an email saying, ""I got a call from the lot the car was parked, I assume that was you taking the wheels"". My response was ""yes!"". 

He said, ""I thought you were going to hold off. How much are you going to give me?""

Now, keep in mind the truck was going to be scrapped and he was not planning on selling the wheels, one wheel was beyond repair, and he needed my tires for it to be rolled away. It was essentially a couch at the end of his driveway on garbage day.

I offered $80

He said $500. I explained why they are not worth that. And compromised and said $150. Which is way more than I expected to pay. Most people told me $50 was fair.

He then said $400. 

I said if he won't accept $150 then I will swap the wheels back, as the scrap truck was a day late. 

He then called the lot where the car was parked and asked them not to let me swap my tires off and put his back on and told me the same via email. He also told me I stole them and the police would charge me with theft under $5000. [I have a digital record of our conversation]

Those are the facts of the story. 

It has been resolved, but I won't go into that. However, I would like an opinion if his actions were extortionate. I do have more details...

Yes. Hindsight is 20/20 and we should have agreed on a price. And no, the actual numbers don't matter much. Every single person who saw the tires I took off, including strangers and lot employees thought his amount of 500 and 400 was absolutely ludicrous and my offer was more than fair.",0

Any and all advice appreciated.


Location: Louisiana


Long. TLDR at bottom.


Early in January of 2019 my stepfather decided to renovate the family house and found a contractor, referred to him by an acquaintance, and signed a contract.


My stepfather is a doctor. He is a smart and gentle hearted guy who tries to see the best in people, giving them many second chances, and tries to avoid conflict as it is not in his nature. Sadly, this hasn’t served him well in the business world. This becomes relevant later.


His first mistake, was not doing his due diligence or any kind of investigation at all. Forget competing offers from other contractors, not even so much as a google search on the guy he was getting into business with. All of which happened before I became aware of the situation. 


Construction began on February 1st, with an estimated completion time of 3-4 months. As my stepfather works insane hours and isn’t always present at the house, I ended up moving in shortly after, to help things go smoothly.


It is currently November 1st and despite giving the contractor plenty of deadlines, the house is far from finished. To be fair, it is worth noting that there were several (approximately 10) additions made to the base contract for additional work (his second mistake). They ranged from relatively small and non particularly time consuming things, such as the pouring of a concrete slab, to things such as the addition of an approximately 10x15 foot conversation pit in the back deck that required altering, dropping, and re-constructing portions of it. Even with these additions, neither myself nor my step dad believe that they warrant 5-6 additional months of time. Another mistake, is that he did not get any written time estimations for these additions.


The contractor seems to have a core group of 4-5 workers which do the bulk of everything, and then certain specialists (painter, plumber, floor and tile crew, etc.) that he works with. 


There have been weeks (the longest I believe was 3 weeks) when not a single person has showed up, and no work was being done on the house. Despite both my stepfather and myself asking the contractor about this, he always dodged it or came up with some excuse. I later found out from some of his core workers that he had straight up taken a job in Texas and been sending them there. 


In addition to the time it has and is taking, there are numerous other grievances that we have, most of which have not been resolved.


A small part (3-4 hole) of the roof was done incorrectly and collapsed during a rainstorm, ruining 5-6k of electronics that were stored in that room. The contractor said he would reimburse us for the damage and said that he would do so at the end of construction by taking the amount off of the end total. When asked why he didn’t go through his insurance he once again dodged the question claiming it would be too expensive, leading us to doubt if we was actually insured (yet another mistake, not checking at the beginning). 


A majority (95%) of the people he employs are non-English speaking Mexican crews with a single English speaking “foreman”. Now while this by no way means that they are illegal and/or uninsured, I have gleaned through the amount of time spent with and around them chatting that most of the workers (such as the ones who did the roof renovation) were getting paid $1-$2 an hour. This, coupled with his hesitancy to go through his insurance for damages, led us to question the situation.


Other things that have happened include: the entire roof being done incorrectly and having to be removed and re-done. Many leaks (rain) that sprung up from the reconstruction of the back deck (2floors), one that has persisted and not been addressed for 6+ months. A plumbing leak from the 2nd floor to the first floor living room, resulting in that portion needing to be redone. Plumbing in entire house backing up for several days after completion of 2nd floor bathroom remodel and shower replacement. Incorrect installation of new shower heads, which was somewhat fixed after several attempts, but still do not function as was discussed or requested. Loss of pressure and delay of warm water in said shower despite us paying for thicker replacement water lines with the assurance that this would not be an issue, and us stressing that we really didn’t want him to complete it and that be the case. When asked to fix the pressure and heating issue the contractor sent his plumber to look at it who then said “This is the way it is, it’s all the pressure and heat you’re going to get”. The replacement countertop, and cabinets underneath them, in the remodeled bathroom were shortened in length by approximately 50% as opposed to the originals. What was discussed was replacing them and installing the same or nearly identical thing, except with a black granite top. When asked when we could pick out the new cabinets we were told that he “had a guy” who would build us new ones and that it would be cheaper that way. Essentially telling us that we had no say. When the new cabinets arrived and were installed, they were already sagging (he said someone would come out and fix them, yet to happen). When we pointed out that the new cabinets and top were not like the original and not what we had in mind, he said that they were shorter because it was cheaper and that it looked better this way. Warping and unevenness of new flooring put in on 1st and 2nd floor. When asked about this he said “this is the way this kind of flooring is, you agreed to it in the contract”. When we told him that he never said that this flooring would be warped or uneven, and that we had asked for something similar to the previous flooring, which did not have that issue even after nearly 20 years, his response was essentially “don’t know what to tell you, this is what is in the contract”. Employees have brought their children to work allowing them to run around the property where there are plenty of hazards such as rusty nails etc. as well as the fact that I brought my German Shepherd to the house, who is contained but is a guard dog. These children had been going up to her enclosure trying to pet her, or talking to her. Partners of employees have also come on the property and picked fruit from our trees, which we have no problem with, except that they would break off entire branches and stuff their pockets and bags to the brim. Despite us telling the contractor that neither of these situations were okay, it still happened several more times and we had to repeat the talk until it stuck. There was also a situation where one of the employees tried to enter my room, which was locked, while I slept and then barged in on my stepfathers room while he was sleeping. The contractor said that he fired the employee after it happened. Some of the roofing work that was done above the back deck is just plain plywood with shingles atop it. In some parts the water leaks through to the area below. When asked to fix it the contractor said “Water will find a way, that’s just the way it is. Nothing to do about it”. Many of the electrical sockets have been without plates for months, light fixtures without bulbs, we were told that after painting they would be replaced but an electrician never came (after initially coming, removing a bunch of stuff and checking the wiring), even though painting has been completed in some areas of the house. The overall detail and craftsmanship of the work that has been done is lacking or nonexistent, and nowhere near the original level. 


Overall, my stepfather has paid over $300,000 to the contractor (initial contract $225,000) and still owes maybe $40-50,000 more. The house was falling apart before due to old age, but looks so much worse now. Anyone that has seen it says it looks like a $50k job. Another mistake was letting work that he was not satisfied with “slide”. The contractor told him that payments would be due in increments as the job progressed and certain portions of it were completed. Now we are 9 months in, some of the initial things in the contract aren’t even near being completed and he is asking for even more money. My stepfather asked for documentation of what was paid so far and for what work it correlates with (he knows the amounts from the checks he’s written but not what they were for). The contractor has said “yea sure I’ll get them to you next week” for close to a month or maybe even two. When my stepfather told him that he wouldn’t pay anything more until he had that documentation and the contractor told him what the money was for, the contractor said “Oh, so are you refusing to pay? Because you know you can’t do that” with the implication being that he would sue and get it from us regardless. 


Unfortunately, I don’t have final say in a lot of the matters that have transpired. My stepfather, true to his character, has tried to be understanding and avoid confrontation at all costs and I think the contractor has just taken advantage of that as much as possible at every step of the way. I’ve been pushing him to seek out a lawyer and see if there is anything to be done but my stepfather believes that since he signed the contract, he has to pay it and there’s nothing to be done about that. He’s finally come around and allowed me to at least see if we might have a case or some grounds for recourse. 


Thanks for your time in reading this.


TLDR; Stepfather is kind and gentle, somewhat naive in these matters. Signed contract. Contractor turned our lives into a nightmare. 3x completion time and still going. Workers not showing up for days, weeks at a time. Terrible quality of materials and craftsmanship. Things left incomplete. Problems not fixed. Some things done incorrectly and refusal to fix. We believe a gross overcharge for everything, not sure. Do we have any recourse?",0
Turning over a towed car to the tow company,0,dq8g0y,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dq8g0y/turning_over_a_towed_car_to_the_tow_company/,3,1572662665.0,"I'm in California and my car got towed on the 29th.

Title says most of it.

Edit: Located in Colorado.

2nd Edit: Not trying to be nasty to my lawyer. Just salty about everything.

My husband was involved in a car accident almost 2 years ago. It was the other (very rich) guys fault 100% (ran stop sign. guy admitted to cop he didn't look.) Husband got a great lawyer immediately. He maxed out our car insurance coverage with just the fucking ambulance ride (whats up USA), the insurance from our lawyer wasn't authorized to approve more money that soon, and we were just kicked off Medicaid that month. So in the first few weeks of him seeking treatment for his injuries which included head trauma, there were some bills caught in the ""in-between.""

One of these awful, horrible places was told many times to contact my husband's lawyer, that we have a settlement coming, and that essentially they need to wait for their money but they *will* get it. They chose to sue us for less than $1,000. A multi-million dollar company. I have refuted their claims, inserted my own counter claims (including violation of Fair Debt Collection Practices Act for never contacting his lawyer).

We are now ordered to attend mediation. This is where my first questions come- what can I expect at this mediation? How can I better prepare to negotiate? How can I make it *explicity clear* that if they are allowed to take our money either through garnishment or otherwise, they would be putting us on the street (which includes our small child) and taking food from our mouths? We have been struggling because he can't work, and I have had to take a full time job that pays MUCH less than what he made on top of me going to school full time- which I can't quit or I will lose my financial aid.

To add more stress to this heaping pile, we have received 3 new bills again from the ""in-between"" time period. We (mostly me really) are freaking the fuck out that we will get hit with another civil lawsuit once it goes to debt collections. I just can't straighten my head out enough to deal with this well.

We want his lawyer to start negotiating and quit waiting around. How quickly can he realistically do this if we say ""do it today""? What in the hell can I do? I am terrified of our financial situation now that these bills are coming to haunt us. I can't stress enough that we ***cannot*** afford to pay them right now! Thus, we also can't afford to hire a debt lawyer, the one he has is only getting paid upon settlement.

Please help, I just need a plan here, some advice on where to go or what to do. Just anything to help so that my brain isn't firing so rapidly and my thoughts stretched a mile thin. Thanks anyone.",0
Billable Hours - Prorating Salary? Are funds being withheld?,0,dq8fp8,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dq8fp8/billable_hours_prorating_salary_are_funds_being/,1,1572662623.0,"I am a contract speech therapist in schools. Instead of being hired by the school district, I work for a contract company that places me at a school district. According to my contract, I am paid a salary (FLSA exempt) based on 1400 billable hours. I receive the same weekly pay all year, including the summer when I am not working. If my billable hours deviate from 1400 hours, then my salary is prorated and my last check of the year would be more or less based on actual hours worked. The billable hours have to do with the amount of time I am at school each day, for which I submit weekly timesheets, and the amount of time I am at school depends on whether it is a half day or not. Typically we end up very close to the 1400 billable hours. 



In my contract, the only thing it states about quitting is that we need to give two weeks notice. I spoke with a friend who recently quit and her last check was the same amount as all the other ones. However, by the time she had quit she had worked something like 350 of the billable hours, which would be 25% (350/1400) of the total billable hours. 



My friend said according to the company, if you quit during the year you would not get summer pay or prorated pay based on hours billed, and this is the case even if you quit two weeks before the end of the school year. Her pay overall was not prorated to be 25% of her salary (since she worked 25% of the hours), but instead she walked away with less for not making it through the school year. I don't understand how this is not withholding of wages, because our wages are in a sense withheld until the summer so we can still get checks when we are not working. Especially in cases for people who quit right before the end of the school year - they could have billed for 1330/1400 billable hours (which would be working 95% of the contract hours) and miss out on hundreds of hours of pay when they quit because they did not make it to the last day of school. 



Can someone explain this to me? Is there some loophole for billable hours that allows the company to get away with this, or are they holding funds from people who quit early (despite this not being stated in the contract)?

So I live in an appartment complex. The other day, I had parked my car next to my neighbor's pickup truck. I had parked in a spot that I was allowed to park in as a resident with a parking pass. And I had parked within the two lines of the parking spot. My car wasn't on the lines; it was within the lines.

The next morning, my neighbor had left a note at my door complaining that I had parked in a way that had obstructed her and that she was going to have my car towed if I parked in that way again.

So later on, I talked to her in person. I told her that I had parked properly within the lines of the parking space and that my car couldn't be towed if it was properly parked in a spot that it was legally allowed to be.

She got very loud and angry. She insisted that it didn't matter if I was within the lines and that if my car made it ""hard"" for her truck to get out her parking spot, then it can be towed. She then said that she had friends in the towing business, who will tow a car for her if she asked them to.

It's not that complex of a situation. She doesn't even dispute that my car was parked legally. I tried to google it but I couldn't really find towing laws(maybe I was searching the wrong thing).

Would it be legal for a towing company to tow my car at her request if I am legally and properly parked within a spot that I am authorized to park in?

Roommate owes $3000 and is unbothered,0,dq8e2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dq8e2o/roommate_owes_3000_and_is_unbothered/,8,1572662424.0,"I (22f) currently live in a 4 bedroom house with three of my friends (25m, 23m and 23m). This house was also rented by our friends last year. It will likely be rented by different friends next year too. 

Currently, one of the roommates (23m), “Sam”, owes around $3000 to our collective friend group. About $1k of this is owed to a friend who no longer lives in the house with us; about $500-$700 is to another friend, $200 is to one roommate (25m), “Barry”; and $1200 is to the other roommate (23m), “Carter”. This is all the debts I am currently aware of, but there may be more. Sam previously has owed me money, but has since paid me back. 

Sam has not been able to pay rent on time for the past 3 months, and we almost got an eviction notice this past month for it because we are on a single lease together. We did not know he had not been paying on time or that he owed over two months worth of rent until we were notified about the potential eviction notice. Needless to say, we panicked and did whatever we had to in order to make sure we had a home, as some of us have nowhere else to go. This resulted in Carter covering Sam’s butt and paying $1200. 

Sam also has not been able to keep up on his portion of the utilities, which is why he owes Barry around $200. This has been an issue since before I moved in and has been happening for at least the past 5 months. 

The other $1,000 that Sam owes is from the initial move in costs over a year ago and to help with some family issues Sam ran into a year ago as well. I have no idea what the remaining $500-$700 was for. 

Sam did not have a job all summer and spent a majority of his time drinking and partying, frequently waking everyone up at night to be let back into the house. He would bring random people who no one else knew into the house with him and they would end up fighting verbally and physically in his room in drunken rages. This sometime would last for hours. It has since continued into the fall, and I almost had to call the police on him once because of it. He does not spend his money on drinks, his friends always give him free drinks. Previous roommates have already had an intervention about this after Sam almost drowned himself on accident while drunk. Nothing has changed. 

It is now the first of the month again, and after hounding Sam all month and Especially this past week, we finally have managed to get him to pay rent on time. He still hasn’t paid back anyone else though and has shown no good faith that he will. 

Lastly, Sam and his brother have both caused damages to the house which have not been fixed. His brother put his foot through the roof of our laundry room while messing around in the attic back in the spring. Sam has stained multiple room’s carpets with his unauthorized dog sitting business from over the summer. Neither of these issues have been fixed and anytime it’s brought up he simply says it’ll get taken care of and laughs it off. 

I’m tired of this. I’m tired of his immature lifestyle which has been affected our sleep and safety. He doesn’t owe me money right now but that doesn’t mean I’m not stressed by the financial aspect of this. It affects whether or not our rent will be paid on time, which affects me. 

What do we need to do? We’ve thought about calling his parents to get them involved, but since he’s our friend we feel hesitant to throw him under the bus to his family. Barry and Carter are also against going to small claims court, which I have seen recommended here countless times. We have 9 months left of this lease and then I’m moving states, so I don’t think I’d be able to move out to save myself. He’s definitely had more than 3 strikes, does he just need to be kicked out? Please give me some guidance.

Edit: We live in Texas. Subleasing is allowed and has happened before. Anytime we sublease we notify the landlords and a new contract is drafted with a new name and signature replacing the person who left. All the other signatures stay the same.",0

Found a lot of cash,1,dq8bi5,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dq8bi5/found_a_lot_of_cash/,11,1572662125.0,"I bought a house recently. The previous owner (sole and original owner) is deceased. EDIT: The house is in the state of Texas.

I found boxes in the attic containing almost $8,000 in 1-dollar bills. I counted it.

Based on the previous owner's career, I can be almost completely certain the money is legitimate. He was a police detective and he operated some some car-washes in his retirement. For that reason, I do not believe the cash is ill-gotten.

For that reason, and because I looked at all of it while counting it, I do not believe it is counterfeit either. The bills have various wear and tear on them like all used money does.

I understand that the cash is legally mine as I bought the house and everything in it, so I don't have a question about that (unless I'm missing something).

What I do not know is what might happen if I waltz into my local bank branch and deposit almost eight thousand 1-dollar bills.

* What, if anything, might the bank do?
* Who, if anyone, will they call?
* What, if any, questions should I be prepared to (not) answer?
* What, if any, trouble am I asking for?
* Is there something else I should do instead? A trusted friend recommended either making small deposits over time or simply paying for groceries with cash and putting the regular grocery money into savings until it's all used up. My concern with both of those is A) the hassle, B) the length of time, and C) specifically with making smaller deposits: if they are large enough to be practical (i.e. not take 2 years) and recurring over a medium to long period of time, would that not raise the same or similar red flags?",1
Condominium is failing to provide clean water,2,dq56o2,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dq56o2/condominium_is_failing_to_provide_clean_water/,4,1572648306.0,"My mom has lived in a condominium for the past 4 years in Brevard County Florida. In that time she has been dealing with a variety of water-related issues. Her faucets and showerheads clog up with sand and gunk. She has had to get a new air conditioner as the parts that water flow through broke, and she had to get a new washing machine as it rusted and broke the drum. She has had plumbers come out and flush her system and clean out pipes, and the issue keeps occurring. She had a plumber come and clean it today, and green algae looking gunk came out along with a lot of sand. The plumber has told her that there is nothing she can do to fix this issue within her unit and that the condominium needs to take action. The condominium board of owners refuses to take any action and is telling her she needs to resolve it herself. She is having to pay expenses for problems that shouldn't be occurring as soon as they are if there wasn't a water issue. And with all that gunk in the water, I'm concerned that it may contain harmful bacteria and sediment inside it which she has been consuming.  

She has been saving the pipes that the plumber has been replacing, taking pictures, and saving receipts. I want her to talk to a lawyer about this issue because I don't believe she should be responsible for this when the plumber says the condo is the one who needs to implement a change outside of her own unit. Should she get her water tested? Should she find a government agency to report this to and/or find a lawyer? What is the agency to report this to? And what kind of lawyer would be appropriate for this issue?

Any insight would be greatly appreciated.",2

"[California Housing Law] I have been locked out of my home, was renting a room from the owner. Concerned about which laws apply.",2,dq55j0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dq55j0/california_housing_law_i_have_been_locked_out_of/,1,1572648157.0,"  

I have been renting a room from an old friend who lives in a manufactured home in a trailer park in Southern California. I ran late on the rent (while continuing to keep the landlord informed of my progress in trying to get it raised). Then one night I came home to find I'd been locked out (the landlord locked the door bolt from the inside). I wasn't even 30 days late yet! No prior notice of a lockout. I called the sheriff but they weren't interested in a civil matter. After a couple weeks, any money I had raised was quickly gone as I had no place to live, no clothes, toiletries, etc. Now I am homeless, can't work (I work from home or with equipment and tools stored in my room), and even if I were given access to retrieve my belongings, I have no money to find a new place now. This person has cost me easily a solid $20K in damages. I lost several large contracts, and long-term clients, will probably lose several of my other positions as I've not been able to do any work from my main workstation in a month now. This simple, stupid act has destroyed my career...

At this point, I'd LOVE to move out of his home. I am so angry with him I really don't want to see him ever again. But how can I move out when I am locked out of the space? He has said that he will work with me in getting my possessions but only if I pay him a portion of the rent owed. But I am penniless, homeless, and without a job now so this is an impossible condition to meet. So, I have to resort to legal measures to have justice done. 

But I have questions relating to my condition: I believe the technical term for me in this situation is a ""lodger"" and not a tenant. This is due to the fact that I am a single-family renting from the live-in property owner. According to Section 1946.5, this is my scenario and designation. But I think there are a couple of factors that would disqualify the landlord from this condition...

1) All owners must be living within the home: If there are multiple owners listed on the property, and they don't all live on site, it is a disqualification. I checked with the Assessor's office and confirmed that the only owner listed on the property is the same person as has been living there (despite him telling me that the ownership of the home was split between himself and his dad -it may just be an informal, verbal agreement to help him split the costs and nothing official). It may also mean that while the person living within owns the structure, both him and his father contribute to the space rent. So, this becomes unclear if the landlord is also the owner in entirety. I am leaning towards the owner of the structure counting for 100% of the condition as listed in the Section but I am not sure if it can be argued about ownership regarding space rent. The unit is paid off so the only monthly obligation now is just to the space rent.

2) Another part of the conditions of Section 1946.5 would be that the owner has full access to the entire property. I would say that this is not the case as I had a lock on both my bedroom and bathroom doors when I was still living within. This would disqualify the landlord from employing this section for eviction and then would have to comply with a standard landlord / tenant eviction process.

Does it sound to any of you like one of those possibilities would work in an argument about eviction processes? Either way, I still think that his lock-out actions are illegal no matter what the defined condition. Now the main concern I have is getting back home as fast as possible now. I believe the term is an injunction that needs to be filed with the courts to legally compel him to let me back in the home. Can this be done quickly or does it require a court appearance by both parties and all the usual court proceedings to even get going? I'm pretty sure I am going to need an experienced lawyer to proceed but have zero money. I believe this is a strong case / argument for damages caused but how can I best present this to a lawyer quickly so I don't waste either of our times?

A final option was presented to me a few days ago and I am considering it. This landlord is easily classified as unpredictable and acts without much thought. I have numerous emails, and text messages from him where he makes bold-faced threats to me as well as taunts about my situation. He has also made wild claims about supposed evil mis-deeds I have committed. I am thinking of getting a restraining order against him. This way I can return to my home without fear of erratic, unpredictable reactions that could wind up hurting us both. A restraining order could potentially extricate the owner from his home while I am there. I have no other place to go and he still has his parents' house just a mile away available. Does anyone think this is a potential avenue?",2

Crook Dentist- can he sue me?,1,dq83zj,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dq83zj/crook_dentist_can_he_sue_me/,1,1572661175.0,"STATE OF TEXAS (have 5 months left on statute of limitations)

TL;DR:  POS dentist lied about number of cavities. Posted angry reviews. They publicly denied my story and sent me my records with different information than what they told me originally. No consequences after reporting them. I have great dirt (screenshots of inappropriate messages, HIPPA violations) on them that I want to share on their FB page. I fear legal retaliation.

I went to this dentist a year and a half ago who cleaned my teeth for free in exchange for a good review. It went well and he was nice. He informed me I had 8 cavities. He pressured me to book an appointment to get them filled right away, saying I might need root canal if I didn’t do it within the year.

I have severe dental anxiety because of horrific experiences I had as a child, so I said no thanks. I was considering letting those teeth rot to the point where they had to be removed so insurance might pay for more sedation.

A year later I go to another dentist, this time a trusted family dentist and learn that I actually have NO CAVITIES.

I was furious and wrote reviews describing my experience in every outlet I could. Their public responses to my review denied my testimony and contained blatant HIPPA violations. The director of operations contacted me via FB messenger and had an extremely unprofessional interaction with me. I reported the HIPPA violations and they were investigated and reprimanded.

I also reported the malpractice to the correct authorities, however there is no proof, so they didn’t investigate beyond seeing that my records say I have no cavities. All I know is that the dentist lied (or made a mistake, unlikely) to me. He either wrote down the false information and changed it or or recorded something completely different than what he told me.

He has evaded all responsibility for his actions and he probably always will because all he needs to do is alter the records or whatever he’s been doing.

I want to share screenshots of the inappropriate messages sent to me by the director of operations and photos of the official letter sent to me regarding the HIPPA violations on Facebook, Google reviews, and Yelp.

Even though my photos would be perfectly valid, I still fear legal retaliation. I just want this fucking villain to have some consequences, even if it only scares him or loses him a couple patients. 

As someone with severe dental trauma, even the thought of having my perfectly healthy teeth drilled into, leaving me with several fillings I’d need to maintain for the rest of my life makes me shake and cry. This piece of shit is doing this every day and gets away with it.",1

Yesterday, my key, provided to me by the landlord, snapped off inside the front door to our apartment building complex.  I contacted the landlord, asking what I should do in this situation and they provided me with a number for an emergency locksmith.  

When the locksmith arrived, he told us the lock was actually old, unsecure and that insurance companies wouldn't cover us with this lock fitting.  He showed us how he could jimmy the lock open with a credit card and unlock it through the letterbox, before quoting €370 for a new one to be fitted.  After ringing the landlord to confirm they would cover this cost, I was told I would have to pay it.  I refused, the locksmith was sent away after doing nothing to the lock, I was left with a €150 bill just for his time (although he left a note on the receipt stating the lock was faulty before the key snapped off inside)...  The landlord has now informed me that they have sent another locksmith, due to arrive later today, and that I would also be expected to pay for this.

Seeing as the locksmith showed the door can be opened in multiple ways without a key and also isn't covered on insurance against theft, am I right in assuming that this cost should fall on the landlord?  It is the landlords duty of care to provide a safe environment for tenants, and seeing as this is a public entrance for multiple tenants, I feel like I am being taken advantage of by being asked to foot the bill.  

It is also worth noting that other tenants have previously emailed the landlord expressing their concerns for their security because of the dodgy lock, so they were aware of this months before I moved in.

If the landlord refuses to pay for this new fitting, am I legally able to deduct the cost of the locksmith from my rent next month?

Recently, the CEO of my company decided they didn't was us to hire people under the age of 18 anymore. While this sucks, since most of the work force coming to us for jobs are high schoolers, it's not unheard of. 

However, they sent out an email again stating they wanted anyone under 18 fired. Understandably, all the managers under this person have been telling them how awful that is and how unreasonable and we've told them, if we did everything they're asking of us (i.e. only hiring 18+ and firing anyone younger) we wouldn't be able to open our doors and some locations might even have to shut down. In response, the CEO would just shake their head, stating '[they] wish there was something [they] could do.' 

They won't listen to reason, to the point of just leaving the room when it is brought up to them. Many of us are at a loss for what to do. We don't want to fire our minor workers, but if we go against the CEO, we could loose our jobs too, then everyone is out of a job.

Since I didn't get a semester parking permit, I have to pay for daily parking permits to display on my dash. Last Tuesday, when I came back to my car I found a $50 parking ticket on my windshield for not displaying a valid permit. Sure enough, the permit I had paid for that morning was face down on my dash (the permits clearly say they must be face up). I figured I had just absentmindedly slapped it on the dash face down, but in the days since I have realized that the machine prints them curled in such a way that it's easy for them to flip over on their own, so now I make a point to bend them straight.

I am wondering if it's worth disputing since I did technically do it wrong. I didn't take any pictures for evidence since I didn't think it would help, but I do have my parking permit from that day with the last 4 digits of my debit card as proof of payment. I think I may have displayed it face up and it flipped over, which isn't exactly my fault. Even if I did mess up and display it upside down, I paid my $10 for daily parking, so I would be relatively satisfied if they would at least knock $10 off the ticket.

I would love any advice on what information to include, how to be honest without making myself look bad, etc. I have 21 days from Oct 22 to dispute online. I think there are 3 rounds you can go through to dispute.",0

I have a licensed therapist who I saw for approximately 10 years.  I chose to end our patient relationship because I was not making any progress and he was starting to cross professional boundaries (nothing sexual or physical). I also found a more specialized counselor who he was obviously jealous of.

He was generally manipulative and continued to text me for the next two months until I chose to block his number entirely.   Four months after being blocked he emailed me out of the blue and said he had been in the area and it ""took everything not to stop by"".

There was no threat of harm or any other context except he obviously considers our relationship to be something beyond professional.  He seems to view our relationship as parent/child.

I live in New York and I went in and bought a bunch of items because we’re a family of 7. Im the only boy so I do the shopping. I bought a lot of food items and a pair of headphones because my old ones broke. I put them in two big bags and payed. I prefer grocery stores for this reason because they help you pack but I digress. I price matched the headphones separately and dropped it in the bag. My pickles tore through the bag and broke so they let me get another one while in the store. I went for the door and security stopped me. Taxi is there waiting for me outside. This is where everything turned left. 

 I ask them whats the problem. No answer. They took my bags and emptied it. Wheres the receipt? Right here I got it. You cant get these pickles. Okay but why? The smaller ones are 70 cents more. I told them that they didn't have the big ones in stock so I got the smaller ones in the same brand and didn't know they were more. He says yeah right ill get the bigger ones. Im waiting. I wait some more. Taxi is getting mad with me im telling him to please wait. He tells me he's going to leave. I say keep the pickles I don't need em. And run out to the Taxi. The security guard runs behind me WAIT OPEN UP THE BAGS YOU GOT THE PICKLES IN THERE? So I'm there like wtf dude you guys took them out check in with them at the register. He's like GIVE ME THE BAG.

[WA] Our landlord asked us not to sign a lease on a short term rental and is now keeping our security deposit.

In areas that are used to having travel health professionals, it's typical to find housing options that cater to them specifically.

That was the case for our most recent rental. The unit was posted on Craigslist. We met the landlord there. Three buildings each with seven units, built in the last couple of years. Nice condos. Having verified my SO's employment (he knew the clinic her job was at), he said a lease would be unnecessary as we're clearly reliable tenants. The rotation was scheduled for about 3 months and we moved in once the prior tenants were out -- ended up being 8/21. We communicated verbally that it would be *about* 12 weeks, but, again, there was no lease as per her insistance. I was reluctant about that idea at first but decided to roll with it since it was a small-ish town and other travelers had rented from him.

Upon move-in, we paid him ~$2,460 as $900 for the security deposit, $1,200 for September rent, and the rest as rent for the remaining days in the month of August. I'm fuzzy on the exact amount for the prorated rent because it came from my SO's account.

On September 28th, we sent him a text to inform him that we'd be moving out for 11/1 (likely a few days earlier), and paid that month's rent via check. The next job had been lined up in the two days before and we wanted to give at least 30 days notice of move out. He said no problem and thanked us for being good tenants. We then complied, no problem, with showing the unit to prospective tenants a handful of times in the month of October.

We moved out on 10/26 and notified him of doing so. He had seen the unit when showing the prospective tenants and did not see any need for a walkthrough. We told him we had no problem with him starting the next tenant early even though we had paid for the entire month.

Here's the kicker. He text us back that he had not found a tenant yet and, since we said we'd be there for three months, he had no choice but to keep our $900 to pay for the unit until 11/21. We text him back that our understanding was that we were renting monthly and did the right thing by giving 30+ days notice.

We feel pretty hosed. We genuinely liked the guy. My intuition is that he's having a hard time renting these new units and is taking advantage of us accordingly.

Is there anything we can do to get our security deposit back?

Tenancy and Psychopaths AUS VICTORIA,1,dq7vaj,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dq7vaj/tenancy_and_psychopaths_aus_victoria/,0,1572660108.0,"Okay, it's a long and painful story but I've been renting off a friend (600 a fortnight) and have recently had the relationship go sour after she assaulted me and her step daughter. The home is a four bedroom home where I had two rooms, a bedroom and a small lounge. It was on 16 acres that she runs privately as an agistment, where I kept a stallion in an electrified paddock. We did not have a tenancy agreement as, obviously, I hadn't realized she was a psychopath.  Anyway, we had a falling out due to the treatment of her stepdaughter, this ended up with a physical attack on her part in which she assaulted me and then her step daughter when she tried to help me. I was able to get the daughter out of there and contact the ambulance and the police and they've since removed her from the step mothers care and currently have charges laid against her. 

Anyway, since I have the horse still on her property, she's basically using it as a way to torment me. She has since removed the electric fencing and stated that I must replace it (she gave me a few hours notice) and I would be footed the bill should he do any damage. Her mare (whose on heat) is two paddocks down from my stallion, so.. she's basically asking for him to go through her fences, in fact, she's probably crossing her fingers. She is also stating I must pay for previous damages to his paddock (done by her ponies), and has sent me a renewed contract to sign before I'm allowed back onto the property. The police have informed me that she will more than likely be doing this because the last contract doesn't cover their asses and she intends to use the new one to force me into paying her money, they don't want me to sign it but I'm not allowed on the property if I don't. 

I've arranged to have the horse picked up this Sunday, but she's told the lady I've given my stallion to (I've unfortunately had to give away most of my pets, as well as abandon my things because of this woman) that he isn't to leave the property until I've paid her. As mentioned, I pay 600 a fortnight and just recently transfered 2 weeks agistment into her bank account, she also wants 2 months rent for the first few weeks that I stayed with her in which she invited me to in order to ""get back onto my feet""

This is pure spite, I'm the only thing she can get her hands around so she's using everything in her power to hurt me. She was also responsible for feeding my horse (I've been working sometimes 12 hour days and pay extra for a service fee that is supposed to have him fed twice a day) as he has dropped weight, I know this hasn't been getting done, but she's trying to say it's because of me. Thankfully, the lady I've given him to understands and believes me entirely. The woman used to have her step daughter feed the horses (sometimes making her feed 15-20 times a day) and now that the daughter has been taken to safety, she has to do so herself, and I'm certain this won't get done so I've opted out of paying that fee. However, I am not allowed on the property to feed him and I am NOT signing that document. 

Basically, I'm in desperate need of advice. What are my rights if I have them at all? This woman assaulted me and a 13 year old and yet she's allowed to do these kinds of things. I have bank statements that show my payments, as well as witnesses that know I've been living there. What's the best way to handle this situation? Is it even worth it? Do I let her win and get away with everything? I honestly just want it all finished so I never have to talk with her again, I don't intend to get vengeful or nasty about any of it. Please. Any advice is much appreciated.

&#x200B;

Last Saturday, I purchased a car online through a major online used car retailer. I completed all their documents and received a retail purchase agreement, signed by the retailer. The loan payment was set up with my credit union and I pre-paid for 6 months of insurance on the vehicle.

&#x200B;

Tuesday, the retailer called asking how the loan would be processed. I confirmed the information with them and fixed a few details regarding their records of my credit union's contact information. I was under the impression that everything was would be ready for me to receive the vehicle Saturday.

&#x200B;

This morning, I logged back into the website to confirm the pickup time with the intention of setting up a third party inspection of the vehicle. The website claimed that the vehicle is no longer available due to my own inactivity. I called them and found out they canceled the order because they were still waiting for the information on how the loan amount would be paid to them. They have since sold the vehicle to another customer. On the phone, they said ""We really dropped the ball here and will make an internal report""

&#x200B;

I'm irritated that they agreed to sell me the car, sent me finalized paperwork, and pulled out of the sale. I'm working with my bank to stop the payment. Do I have any power here? I'm out around $800 for the prepaid insurance. Thank you for any help!

&#x200B;

I'm in California if it helps. The retailer is based out of Arizona, and the Retail Purchase Agreement is marked as Georgia.

So earlier in the week i went to HR with some emails he had sent me that include the inappropriate questions and explained the situation i'm in.

my question is whats going to happen? Is it just going to get worse? Should i just plan on finding a new job? Should i have the customers who have been exposed to this behavior also report it?

Fast forward several months and some heavy rain and I notice that one of the new windows is leaking. I called the company that installed them and they came out to look. Their employee did a leak test on it and determined that it was due to the caulking having been incomplete, a problem he attributed to their installation. He apologized and came out a few days later (after the windows had dried from his leak test) to finish caulking and correct the problem.

I have some minor drywall damage that I think they should cover due to it having been their faulty installation that caused it. They maintain that they worked for the flipper and not for me, so they're not liable to me for any damages.

We have had a lot of issues with their birthmother who is very high conflict and a drug addict on top of it (has been arrested, jailed, probation, etc.) Her daughter has lied before saying I hit her in the mouth which was very saddening but I get they feel split in their loyalty. 

Anytime BM and boyfriend have asked me to step away and not discipline, like spanking, I have done as requested. I get the kids off to school every morning and despite boyfriend begging BM to have more involvement with the kids due to children acting out (like daughter stealing everything from money from strangers to my makeup and kids throwing a fit when mom doesn’t follow through on promises) she rarely can make it even though she has no job. When she does have them, she lets them run around unsupervised in the neighborhood and according to kids, ignores them.

Today she flipped out that apparently the kids told her I am hitting them to get them out of bed. We are pretty sure the kids never said that as she hasn’t seen them in a day, so why would she just now bring it up, and also I don’t wake them up, my boyfriend does before he leaves for work. I don’t mind her taking the kids in the morning from now nor being told I’m not allowed to watch them anymore, but I do mind being accused of criminal activities. She threatened to take him to court which she has done several times and both her mom and I have advised him to follow through on court regardless of her backing out or not. What are my legal options in being accused of abuse? 

Some background: I have a log of all the things she has done so far (to me, kids, and boyfriend) and have been a chaperone for elementary kids since I was a teenager since my mom is a teacher. I also was a caregiver for several years, including hospice. I have a clean record. I just want to cover my ass with these kind of false allegations.

TLDR: accused of abuse by Birth Mother when waking kids up for school, but it wasn’t brought up when she says the kids said it i.e. last night, only mid day while she is fighting with her boyfriend. Also do not get the kids up for school, boyfriend does though I do get them to the bus. Any legal advice to protect myself would be helpful.",1

They showed disregard for the law and only returned a portion of my deposit (all recorded through text and email).  I am looking to bring the LL to small claims court, but am waiting to go over the details with a legal advice center.  I have an appointment with a center in a week or two and I want to go over the details with them before I begin the process of suing them. I also have a friend still renting a room at the residence and would hate it if the LL took the situation badly and kicked him out as a result (he could be my eye witness to the events, which would upset the LL).

What is the limit of time when I can sue the landlord? 

Do I need to begin the process ASAP?

I have a correspondence with the LL over text and email where they refused to return the deposit.  Do I still need to send a formal security deposit demand letter? If so do I need to send this ASAP? I feel the demand letter would be redundant as they already refused to send the full deposit back.

I told the HR rep that she could check the public dockets to see this is true, but she told me that alone wouldn't be sufficient in passing the check. She explained that I should provide evidence that I had initially gotten the retail theft charge and had it reduced, but it appears no such documentation seems to exist. I immediately called my lawyer's office and they stated it would take some time to find such records if they even exist, but that if such documents exist they are kept offsite. 

I was told that unless I could prove the charge was reduced I will not be hired, and the best case scenario as it stands is that I write an anonymous essay explaining the incident which would be presented to a team of the company's lawyers. She did say that the fact that my expungement petitions have been filed will help me, as in PA it requires 5 years without incident, but unfortunately that process won't be completed until at least March of next year.

What I had disclosed prior to the background check is that I have multiple summary offenses that were a result of irresponsible use of alcohol, and that I am over 5 years sober and attend a support group, which the HR rep also said will be useful, but as it stands she stated there are three categories the company places individuals in in regards to background checks: Absolutely will not hire (retail theft falls under this - this is me), may hire (where I would be placed if I showed this evidence), and absolutely will hire. 

I have already sent this HR rep a signed and submitted petition for expungement relating to the charge and the public docket relating to the charge, but as it stands that may not be enough for them to move forward with me. 

Can anyone give me some advice on how to go about reclaiming any records showing this was a reduced charge? It had not been a problem at any of my previous employers, although my previous employers only did a standard background check, not a fingerprint/FBI check.",1

My California job is field based therapy and involves driving to client homes/schools/etc. Despite my trying to find out at the beginning of the job, the amount of estimated driving (in hours or miles) was never made clear. As the driving increased, it worsened my disability symptoms more than I expected. When I realized that the amount of driving was only going to increase, I submitted a letter from my physician limiting my driving to two hours a day. 

About two weeks after submitting my accommodation request I was verbally informed that they didn't think they could make the accommodation. Around that time I took a medical leave, partially related to exacerbation of health issues from the unmet accommodation. I incorrectly thought I was eligible for FMLA, but I'm 6 weeks short of meeting criteria. 

A few days into the medical leave I was told in writing that they could not meet my reasonable accommodation request. They provided no explanation for the denial and offered no alternative. They also informed me that my medical leave is unpaid and that I have no job protection or benefits protection.

Driving is not listed in the essential job functions in the employment posting or paperwork. It's listed as a physical requirement but with no specifics about time or mileage. I'm unable to return to work without the accommodation. 

To the best of my understanding, my only recourse is to file a claim or lawsuit of discrimination based on disability. I'm trying to understand

A) is that my only recourse?
B) is it even worth it to pursue, or do I just leave and try to move on? 

I hesitate to post on reddit about this issue, but I've reached out to multiple lawyers, local organizations, DFEH, and EEOC over the last week. None have been able to really answer questions until scheduled appointments next week.

"[Maryland] Renting a townhouse, HVAC unit malfunctioned and has been drawing insane amounts of electricity.",1,dq78t4,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dq78t4/maryland_renting_a_townhouse_hvac_unit/,1,1572657324.0,"Hey all.

I am renting a townhouse with two friends in southern Maryland. On the night of October 3rd, our HVAC began to leak all over our basement. We went through the normal property management company to get a repair guy out and fix it. It was a clogged condensation runoff pipe. He cut it open, cleaned it out, replaced it and left, and the leak stopped. Since then the HVAC has been working as ""normal"".

Fast forward to October 26th, we get the power bill (which is in my name - we are responsible for utilities and our power company does not allow multiple names on the contract unless you are married). It is nearly 450$, which is about 275$ more than usual. Naturally, we called the meter guy out to the house to inspect it, and it is working normally. Unfortunately, since the latest billing period began, we have already gone over the last billing periods usage, and can expect a power bill close to 600$ or more this time around. 

I went to my account management web page for the power company, and as expected, our power use surged to nearly three times the normal amount the night of October 3rd. Putting two and two together, we inferred that the HVAC is indeed somehow drawing this power by mistake. We have now shut the HVAC unit off entirely to stem the nearly 30$ a day in power it has been using. This was further proven when the account showed the power use return to slightly below normal after the shutoff. 

My question is, would the warranty of the HVAC, renter's insurance, or the land lords homeowner insurance cover any part of this insane power bill? I have spoken to the power company, and they do offer payment plans, but an extra $800-$1000 dollars even split over several months would set us back pretty heavily. We have an excellent relationship with our landlord, and we don't wish to increase their insurance rates if its avoidable.

Legality of anti-poaching agreement (California),1,dq78ge,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dq78ge/legality_of_antipoaching_agreement_california/,4,1572657278.0,"I'm leaving my current job soon and as part of my ""exit"" was asked to sign a document that says I agree to not solicit employees for my benefit or another company's benefit.

Is this kind of agreement legal?  My current employer is one of several companies that got into federal legal trouble some years ago by having a non-competitive agreement with another company for this kind of thing.  I thought it was not allowed, since it blocks workers from pursuing opportunities elsewhere.

Additionally, if I don't sign this, could they potentially block my last paycheck or cause other problems for me?

He had trouble keeping jobs because he didn’t have enough money to go to college when he could. He’s in is 60s and going to college wasn’t important then. He had good jobs, they just downsized or fired him to hire younger cheaper college educated workers. Shortly before she divorced him, he had a heart attack. He was lucky it was before cause he didn’t have insurance but he was able to use his wife’s insurance from her job. After surgery and he recovered, she left him. He knew it was coming, she told him once the last kid graduates college she would leave. She didn’t let him or invite him to go to her graduation. She has essentially turned all his kids against him. 

Anyways, she sold the house and all of his belonging inside the house while he was still living there. He asked my mom if he could stay with us for 3 days, about  5 months ago, he’s still living here. He claimed to have a job lined up. Well now he has a job but he can’t start til he gets a car. He wants a $15,000 car (not sure why) and went to the bank for a loan for a down payment on the car. At the bank he found out he only has $400 in his bank account. Apparently his ex wife has been withdrawing his social security check out of their joint bank account every month. He just learned that his son, who was living with him when the house was sold, and had to move out of state because of that, isn’t talking to him either, his ex wife told him that. 

He should have got a new bank account she didn’t have access to as soon as she filed for divorce. I thought it was amicable, cause he even helped her sell the house. He didn’t cheat, he didn’t abuse her or the kids, she essentially kept him and the kids away from his family so they didn’t develop relationship with their relatives on his side. Then blamed us for not being nice to her kids, we just didn’t know them cause they never came to family parties, we didn’t have a chance to be nice or mean cause we never saw em. When my grandma died only one of their kids came to say goodbye. And only one went to the funeral, he was supposed to be a Paul bearer but he hid in the bathroom the entire service. 

Anyways, if she was withdrawing his social security amount every month, is there some legal action that could take place? Also are there any divorce lawyer that won’t take money unless they win? Since my uncle has next to nothing.

I didn't respond because I assumed I would have to consent in order for them to do anything.  I was wrong, and they replaced my door lock, thermostat, plugs and switches, water sensor, etc. while I was traveling for work. 

Now they want me (and every other tenant) to sign an addendum to our leases saying I requested this and asking that I consent to data collection and that if anything goes wrong with the devices that they put in, I am responsible to pay $250 to fix any damage or maintenance to repair or replace them if I do not notify the building within 5 days of malfunction.

Some of the language in the addendum makes me very uneasy.

 `""You have requested that we provide [Insert Name of SmartDevice Vendor] in your unit. We agree to do so and you agree to pay additional rent in the amount of $0.00 per month""`  

I did not request this.

`""Information collected by [Insert Name of SmartDevice Venor] (""Information""): We have listed information collected by each device we supply, some of which may be considered ""Personal Information,"" depending on your jurisdiction:""""1. Front Door Lock:- Entry activity by time and code used- Technical information from device, including, but not limited to, battery level and lock status""`

This language is pretty much the same for Thermostat, SmartPlugs and Switches, Hub, Water Sensor and software to use it all.

`""Information Sharing: Anonymized and aggregated information collected by the Service may be shared with third parties for energy benchmarking, quality of service determinations, and for research and product development. Recipients of this information may include, but are not limited to, equipment manufacturers, consultants, educational institutions, utilities, study sponsors and government agencies""`

Additionally, there is language that specifies that the devices are owned by the property and if I lose or damage any of them, I am subject to a $250 fine. 

`""If a device has been damaged or appears to be malfunctioning, you are required to notify us within five (5) days.""`

What are my options? I really like my apartment and don't want to leave, but I also don't want to consent to sharing personal information re: entering/exiting my apartment with anyone, even if it is anonymized and aggregated and certainly don't want to be on the hook financially for malfunctioning products that I did not want or consent to being installed.

"I could use some help clarifying what ""fiduciary duty"" means to my board members",1,dq6wm6,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dq6wm6/i_could_use_some_help_clarifying_what_fiduciary/,8,1572655851.0,"Location: Minnesota, USA

Without getting too far into it, I'm the Board President of a housing non-profit and we're poised to *potentially* partner with a corporation that could provide up to $2 million a year in kick-back donations from the sales of their product. The problem is that one of the original business partners of the non-profit (who on paper is just one of the regular 8 board members) has been acting as a representative of the agency with the person who's brokering the deal on behalf of the corporation.

This person from the corporation has had very poor experiences with this board member, whom she's characterized as unprofessional and capable of tarnishing her reputation within the corporation. **The person has recently given us an ultimatum to remove the board member from the board or she won't move forward with the deal**. To make matters worse, the person brokering the deal with the corporation is the *other* original business partner's sister, which is an obvious conflict of interest. The two original ""founders"" or business partners of the non-profit are best friends of 5+ years, and the push to vote this person off the board is being presented as ""an unfortunate reality of doing business"".

The rest of the board seems to think that this request qualifies as a perfectly reasonable expectation for the corporation to have, and people have started to wave around the term ""fiduciary duty"" to justify doing whatever it takes to continue chasing after this potential income stream. I completely disagree, and think that restructuring our board to according to the whims of a donor is completely unacceptable. I also value the board member not only as a friend but as someone who brings vital experience and vision to the development of the agency, the departure of whom would be a major loss and creative set back.

I'm meeting with the board tonight and I want to re-frame this. I'm going to present what I feel like is a fairly obvious solution, which is to remove this person from her role as a company-facing representative and have a different board member step up to that role, but retain said person on the board. But I also want to set the record straight on what ""fiduciary duty"" means.

To give you an idea of where some of the board is at on this, I'll paste one of the last emails I got on the subject from a fellow board member:

""*... I draw your attention to #8, which I quote in its entirety:*

*8. Resources*

*A director must assist the organization in obtaining adequate resources to enable it to further its charitable mission.*

*Ladies and Gentlemen, it is very clear that as Members of the Board, we are required to make decisions that are in the best interest of the organization; as the above links demonstrate, ensuring financial solvency is our duty. I will be at this meeting and I will fulfill the obligations of a Board Member by ensuring \[Agency Name\] has the financial resources we are being offered;  I just need to know what day it is.*""

I'll also include a quote from the letter our former attorney wrote on the subject,

""*I'd be remiss if I didn't remind you that every board member must execute their fiduciary duties. Board members have an absolute duty of complete, undivided loyalty to the nonprofit corporation. To put it simply: you have to put the interests of the nonprofit corporation above your own (or your family and friends) interests. In short, don’t do anything that hurts the organization, and make decisions that are good for the nonprofit even if they are uncomfortable to get through. Board members who do not put the best interests of the nonprofit first or do not take measures to protect the nonprofit may breach their fiduciary duty.*""

So ""fiduciary duty"" is being framed as ""You need to do what's best for the agency even if it means hurting your friends"", but am I correct in believing that ""what's best for the agency"" doesn't need to be strictly defined in terms of financial opportunities? Some board members seem to think it would be reasonable for someone to dangle a dollar bill in front of the board and demand that everyone do the macarena.

The most frustrating part of all of this is that the money isn't even promised in writing. We're operating on good faith that this board member's sister will be able to convince her supervisors to agree to appoint our agency as the recipient of the kick-back donations. There isn't as much as an MOU written up in anticipation of any of this.

I hired a new employee on October 18th. Standard W2-receiving employee.

On the morning of October 30th the employee texted me stating that she was sick from ""eating bad sushi"" and would not be in. I told her that it was fine, not to worry about it, and to focus on getting better so she can come back in the next day.

Some people I've spoken to have questioned why a brand new employee has any PTO to use. I offer a small amount of PTO to begin with as I don't want to let a freak illness that just happens to fall in the first few weeks of employment cause significant issues for my people.

Lo and behold, on October 31st she did not show up. I texted her, called her, and left voice messages twice asking when she would be in. No response was received. At the end of the day I sent an email stating:

>EMPLOYEE, This is my fourth and final attempt to reach out to you. You have not responded to any of my prior communications by text, phone call, or voice mail.

>You were expected to be at work at 8:30am on October 31st, 2019. I understand illnesses can occur unexpectedly and with little notice, which is why I was more than understanding when you informed me that you were too ill to work on October 30th, 2019. In my response to that I expressed my expectation that I would see you today. I have received no further communication from you. You are required to inform me any time you will be missing work without exception.

>If I do not hear from you by end of business today, I will have no choice but to take action regarding your future employment with COMPANY NAME.

No response has been received as of noon November 1st. I have documented all written communication attempts and saved screenshots of all calls attempts

My question is whether or not, when calculating her final paycheck I need to include the 8 hours of PTO from her initial missed day on October 30th. Obviously, I'd rather not pay it given the circumstances that have followed, but will happily do so if that is a legal obligation. 

Any advice you can give would be incredibly appreciated.

My wife is a dentist. She graduated from Dental school about a year ago and was thrilled to get hired as an associate dentist at a private practice right out of school. We thoroughly read the contract as it was apparent the main dentist probably got it offline and tweaked it to her liking. The contract was for full time work and explicitly stated a minimum of 4 days a week, 8 hours a day. The first month she was started on 3 days a week saying it was a ""trial period"" for growth that would then increase. It has now been nearly 6 months and she has not been given a single week with 4 work days(only 3) and last week her boss told her she would be taking away a day a week! So now she will only be working 2 days a week.
She has had conversations with her boss firmly stating she needs the hours in the contract but the boss wont budge basically giving excuses and promising it will change. The office manager told my wife the business is not doing good so the boss is trying to compensate by cutting her hours.


My question is should we be suing this dentist??She technically owes my wife thousands of dollars for the days she isn't letting her work that are promised in the written contract. But its also my wife's first dental job and if word gets out that she sued her first employer she may never find work in our area again.. We are very frustrated and not sure what to do.

Has my Boss Committed Investment Fraud?,1,dq5rzx,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dq5rzx/has_my_boss_committed_investment_fraud/,3,1572651003.0,"I work in a small private equity firm that buys commercial real estate. My boss will typically take convertible debt notes (CDN) from prospective investors to cover buying fees/closing costs of target properties before the company actually buys them. After we close on a property, an investor holding a CDN on the deal can choose to convert their debt into deal equity or get their money back with interest.

Recently we had one good project and one bad project. The good project closed and all investors converted from debt to equity. There was one CDN for the bad project. The investor did not want to convert into the project, but my boss really needed the property and didn't have the funds to pay back the convertible debt note.  

He allowed the bad project investor to convert into the good project after the good project had closed. This diluted the other good project investors, which he has not told them about. We also didn't need the funds for the good project at that point, so the dilution was unnecessary. These CDN funds had been already spent on the bad project. My boss now keeps the bad property in his ownership even though the debt used to buy it went into another deal.

Apartment Complex refuses to honor lease agreement but still requires me to pay a termination fee,1,dq5puo,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dq5puo/apartment_complex_refuses_to_honor_lease/,2,1572650730.0,"I recently moved into an apartment complex about 4 months ago. The apartment itself was not move-in ready for the fact that I had to document over a dozen repair orders, which took over a month to fix. The real crux of the issue though has been my neighbors above. Allow me to elaborate.

Everyday, almost all day my neighbors constantly drag and drop heavy items across the floor for hours on end, stomp excessively, and would do all of this during the building's quiet hours. In one instance I recorded a video of them vacuuming excessively, early in the morning (during quiet hours) but the building manager dismissed this as a washing machine. I've had to call the police multiple times due to the fact that they would make so much noise at odd hours of the morning and night where I couldn't sleep.

I made it a point to constantly email my building manager of what I was experiencing but on numerous occasions was ignored. When I did receive a response it was that, ""They would be moving out soon so the noise shouldn't be an issue anymore"". Turns out that *month* turned into two and nothing was ever resolved. At that point I reached out to the regional manager in hopes to terminate my lease, free of charge due to these multiple lease violations but she was just as unhelpful. She vowed to take several actions including, getting the police reports and visiting my room to inspect the noise but never did. She mentioned that the police reports alone would justify taking action. I say *alone* because later they later lied and used the fact that the cops noted no noise in the report to justify not taking any action.

Most recently I sent them an audio recording of the vacuuming done during quiet hours. Keep in mind this vacuum had the sound of a buzzsaw and would persist for at least 2 hours. The regional manager used the **town's** noise ordinance law vs. what was stated in the lease agreement and refused to take action.

I then went to the VP of the company, explained my case, and gave an outlined email trail of my experience. He ended up siding with them and only wanted to reduce the fee to one month's rent but I still needed 2 months notice. This has had a serious impact on my mental health and feel like I have sufficient evidence through email, audio, and video to fight this but wanted to check here to get further assurance. I'm happy to answer any additional questions. Thanks!",1

I think my boss violated the school policy regarding staff during school closures. Is there anything I can do?,1,dq5poe,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dq5poe/i_think_my_boss_violated_the_school_policy/,7,1572650709.0,"I work at a public university in the United States. I am currently a Graduate Assistant, meaning I am a full time student earning my masters and working at an office on campus part time with the agreement that working in that office allows my tuition to be waived. I also receive a yearly stipend that is paid to me over the course of 12 months. 

Today, the university closed due to high winds and power outages across campus. However, I work in an office that coordinates events for visitors who are not currently students of the institution. The message sent out by the university alert system read as follows: “[University] Alert: Due to road closures and power outages, [University] is closed, classes canceled until 5 p.m. Storm day staffing in effect.” 

We recently had a transition of leadership in my office. My previous boss told us that whenever the institution was closed, we would cancel any events scheduled, she would notify the visitors (they also get an automated email notification that the event is cancelled), and I would not have to come to work. I am not classified as “Storm Day Staff.” Today however, my new boss expected me and a few other non-Storm Day Staff to come to work. 

I have looked up the policy regarding Storm Day Staff on the institution’s website and found the following: “Because class time at the university level is so valuable and because an overwhelming majority of [University] students live either on campus or very nearby, class cancellations attributable to inclement weather should be very rare. However, since there are occasions when extraordinary weather conditions may cause cancellation of classes for a brief period of time, it is prudent and necessary that the university have in place a clear and effective policy for handling such situations. It should be noted that, as a residential community, [University] is never “closed”; instead, classes are canceled. 

Each [University] department is expected to develop a Storm Day Staffing Plan (SDSP). Each SDSP should be subject to review and approval by the unit’s vice president. The plan will inform each employee of his or her obligation to report to work in the event of a cancellation or postponement of classes. The plan should take into account the essential staffing levels necessary to operate the university in a safe and efficient manner for those students who are on campus. A copy of each department’s SDSP should be on file with the dean, director or department head.”

I have never seen the Storm Day Staff Plan for my department. I have no idea if it exists or how to find it. When I ask my current supervisor about my expectations during closures she said it’s a “case by case basis” and I should wait for communication from her after getting university alert notifications. And if she says the event is on, I am expected to come in. 

She also expects the undergraduate students who work in our office to come in. When I and a few other Grad Assistants told her we think it’s unfair to expect undergraduates to come to work when classes are cancelled she said, “Well this isn’t class. This is a job.”


I think it is also important to note that Graduate Assistants at my institution are not unionized, but most Storm Day Staff, who are usually hourly employees like custodians, dining hall workers, and administrative assistants are unionized. 

So, anyway, I came to work today and I am staffing this event but there’s no power and I run into one of the custodians who I am friendly with. He asked why I was here and I told him the event was still on. He was shocked and said, “Well you get paid double for being here!” I thought he was joking because he often makes jokes about how I should be paid more for the work I do, so I laughed and he said, “No. I’m serious. Storm Day Staff gets paid double for coming in during closures. Make sure your supervisor knows that.” To which I responded, “Well. I’m not Storm Day Staff. And I’m on a stipend.” And he said, “You shouldn’t be here then.”

I’m not sure what to do because I kind of feel used and lied to. My supervisor told me she made the final call, despite the university’s policy. And I’m not getting double pay, but everyone else who is required to work is. And I’m not saying I wouldn’t have offered come in to help out with something for the visitors that travelled from far away expecting an event to happen because I live 2 minutes away from my office and it wasn’t at all dangerous for me to get from home to work today. So it’s not like I was in danger or harmed, but it feels wrong that I haven’t seen any official written communication stating that I am required to work when the institution is closed. 

I’m afraid to talk to my boss about it because she’s already told me that if she decides the event is still happening, then she expects me to come in. I’m afraid to talk to the Vice President of my department because she’s intimidating and mean. And I don’t know who else to talk to. Is this the sort of thing I could go to HR about? Would I even have any ground to stand on since I’m only a part time Grad Assistant and I was never put in any real danger? Would it even do any good?

I know this sub isn’t the place to go for official legal advice, but I’m just looking for any kind of information or conversation that could help me get some clarity with all of this. I feel taken advantage of and weird about the whole situation. Thank you to anyone who responds.",1

Help with lease agreement amendment [OH],1,dq5m1u,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dq5m1u/help_with_lease_agreement_amendment_oh/,1,1572650271.0,"To make this quick:

I had a 1 year lease agreement with a tenant of mine. In the lease agreement it states that for premature termination of the lease agreement there had to be 60 days notice and early termination fee of $935 was to be assessed on top of rent owed for time spent there.

About 4 months ago, I sent him a text asking if he was planning to buy at the end of his lease (this was briefly talked about as a possibility in person, nothing guaranteed). He stated he was not buying. 

Okay, I let him know that I would be returning to the residence in January to do improvements while just living there myself not worrying about landlordship. I wanted to at least give him a heads up as early as possible. 

I also said 'If you find a place ahead of time and give me notice, you could go without obligation'

He said 'Okay'

Today I find out after mentioning that he should give a 30 day notice that he has found a place and is picking up the keys tomorrow. The technical monthly due date for rent is the 10th of every month.

Did I handle this wrong? Was the terminology too vague to hold much weight? How can this be interpreted? Is this a situation where I may just be at a total loss?

Tire Warranty and Car Dealership Problems: Is this legal?,1,dq5lkw,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dq5lkw/tire_warranty_and_car_dealership_problems_is_this/,6,1572650208.0,"I'll try to preface the story as short as possible. Thanks for any advice.

I leased a 2017 Jeep Grand Cherokee from a very large dealership in Western New York. As I was getting an oil change, as I do every 5,000 miles and the courtesy tire rotation, the worker advised me my tire tread was unreasonably low for the mileage of 30,147 miles. Honestly, I figured it was an upsell scam and declined a quote for new tires but after doing some research online I came to find this is a very common problem. As explained by the dealership, the ""new tire contour"" allows the test drive and initial drive of the vehicle to be more comfortable. I scheduled an appointment to have them check out the tread on the tires last week and my appointment was yesterday 10/31/2019. When I showed up for my appointment, they immediately turned me away with no advice or assistance where to go next. I spoke with the manager at the store and he assured me they are unable to help as well. I asked for the corporate number and the district customer service manager advised me the same thing. I called Michelin and they advised me to have an inspection done at the dealership. I advised Michelin the dealership said it ""was not their problem to handle"". The Michelin representative called the dealership and was advised that the manager said: ""it's not their issue"". Frustrated I hung up and went to my regular service station where we have most of our service done. They told me the tires were unsafe and needed to be replaced today especially since one had a very large nail in the tire. I took pictures of the tires and called Michelin back. They said since the inspection was not completed at the dealership they are also not responsible. I understand the dealership is not responsible for replacing the tires but isn't there some sort of reasonable service a customer would expect from a car dealership? I assumed they would do an inspection, look up my warranty information, and help me file a claim. I notified the state DMV but they also said it's a Michelin problem. The rep at the dealership says he ""sees new cars all the time that need new tires between 15k-20k."" I was more offended they knew this was a much larger issue. 

The tires are warrantied to 60k miles but were completely done by 32k miles. The dealership took no accountability nor did an inspection thus negating my warranty by getting new tires. I know there are risks within leasing a car but this seems ridiculous. I was not prepared to ever replace tires on this car considering the tire warranty. It's not even about the money as much as it feels like this is a huge scam by the auto industry. They found a way to circumvent ownership costs on leased vehicles so when they sell the car again it will have fairly new tires on it. 

 How are dealerships, car manufacturers, and tire manufacturers getting away with this?",1

Is it illegal to record my property if other's people property happen to be in the background?

I tried to call the police and get the apartment complex involved and they told me they could not do anything unless I had a lead on who the kids were and if I had any video or picture evidence. 

I bought a small camera that sits in my window and records my porch mainly, you can see the person's backdoor that is in front of me in the background. My apartment complex told me that this was okay and I have also seen other residents of the complex have small security cameras. 

I caught that person's children coming onto my porch and messing around. I was told to handle this by myself as it was considered a personal issue. I tried to be neighborly and show her the footage and ask her to talk to her children before I had to get authorities involved. She brushed me off and said I had staged the footage. I sent the footage to the rental office and made a police report after this. 

I guess they spoke to her and they told her to keep her children and their friends off my porch or they will press charges. This has not happened, I have caught them multiple more times and made multiple police reports because they stole packages and broke my front gate. Now, I guess they are threatening eviction to her. She came over with her daughter and threatened me and told me I better hope something bad doesn't happen to me and her daughter screamed that I was beating her and they also told me that having the camera pointed outside like that is illegal . They left after I called the police. 

I received a letter from a lawyer, it's a real lawyer but it is after hours and I can not get a hold of them to make sure the letter came from them, that I was to cease and desist recording as it was against the law because her property is in the background and recording children is considered a pedophile activity. It also said I was racially discriminating against her and she has audio evidence of me threatening her and trying to assault her daughter. It said if the camera is not removed in 30 days I will be taken to court. It also said that if I try any further attempts to have her evicted I will be arrested on assault and battery and intimidation charges. 

In the state of Maryland is recording my porch illegal if her back door is in the video? Is her audio recording enough to have me arrested?

In the school's board of rules,  emails shared with deans are in all cases seen as confidential, and the  dean cannot contact anyone or share the email with others, with the  exception of other deans that have dealt with a case, without my given permission.

Also,  emails that are shared with others about cases that the dean works with  are seen as emails that are confidential and 'shared with my knowledge',  I have to specifically give them permission, on paper, via email etc.  that they can share the email with others.

Lease break agreement quesetion in Massachusetts,2,dq2qtq,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dq2qtq/lease_break_agreement_quesetion_in_massachusetts/,2,1572635331.0,"I live in Massachusetts. I signed a lease earlier this year to move into an apartment, and upon moving in I realized the apartment had a lot of damage that wasn’t obvious from the brief showing I did with the realtor. The landlord was willing to fix it all over time, but I didn’t want to deal with months of getting an apartment up par so I talked with the landlord and we signed a lease break agreement as follows:

> The tenants … request to break their lease at … ending …. They request that their lease ends on …. They agree to vacate the apartment on or before …. They understand that they are responsible for paying the monthly rent until qualified tenants are found to replace them. The landlord agrees to release them from their contract as soon as new tenants are found to enter into a lease.

The landlord and realtor decided to fill this apartment room by room with random tenants who don’t know one another. One month went by and the landlord had found 2 out of 3 tenants for rooms they wish to fill in the apartment paying ~2/3rds of the rent. I paid for the remaining rent for that month, assuming they would find a third tenant during that month. They haven’t and as a result now want me to pay for the remainder of the rent for another month.

Given that the lease break agreement we signed says:

> The landlord agrees to release them from their contract as soon as new tenants are found to enter into a lease.

Is it reasonable for me to say under this agreement I’m not going to pay them anymore, given they have new tenants who have entered into a lease with them? I’m not sure about the term “qualified tenants” here. 

It also seems like there could be an argument to be made that by signing two random tenants (rather than a group or person willing to pay the full rent) they ruined the possibility of getting a third tenant, and I don’t want to continue to pay extra rent for a full year on something that was easily rentable at full cost.",2
Problem with scammer,0,dq5aoq,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dq5aoq/problem_with_scammer/,6,1572648824.0,"Hello all, 

My friend in New Zealand was scammed by someone in Glasgow, Scotland by around £500. How was she scammed? She sent him Bitcoin as he promised her a nice return back via cryptocurrency mining. I helped her realise what mistake she had done and I wanted to see if I could help her regain the funds in any way possible. 

I’m quite knowledgable in the crypto space and I understand linking Bitcoin wallets to individuals is quite a challenge. However, she has his mobile number. She has all the chats of him asking for the amount in Bitcoin and proof of what he said he will return her back. I believe he even put his Bitcoin wallet address into the chat too, which would create some sort of link to the owner of the scammers mobile number. 

I understand scammers get away with this type of crime every hour of every day however I wanted to receive opinions on what others think is possible for my friend to receive her funds back, or at least for this scammer to receive a punishment from the law. 

Remember, she is in New Zealand and the scammer is in Scotland. I know he’s in Glasgow,Scotland because the mobile number traced back to this area. If the law can do anything, I’m assuming she would need to contact the police in New Zealand? Or do you think this would be a waste of time? Surely the police in New Zealand can contact the police in the UK and have the identity confirmed of the mobile number. Then they can proceed to questioning the suspect?

Part of the contractual agreement (signed in 2017, but have not signed one since) states that if I do not continue to work with them for 2 years after the highest degree of certification, that I must pay them back.

However, there are a number of things that have occurred since I first started working with them that will make this difficult. These relate to safety and some interpersonal issues (i.e. demanding I come in outside of working hours for an ""important meeting"" with one day notice and then leaving me high and dry- not showing up).

Here is the kicker. In August I was told that I would not be enrolled for the final semester in September due to performance issues. I have evidence contrary to the complaints listed in the nasty employee review that was given to me and some of the points mentioned have more to do with what looks like to be a suspected medical/mental health issue rather than actual issues with performance (e.g. you don't smile at the kids enough, you are cold towards other staff). Things that don't have written documentation of. Also- none of this was addressed with me prior to my removal from school and that there was no warning given.

Several accounts are part of the estate and at least two accounts are POD IRAs and not part of the estate (they were not part of probate and are being distributed to the beneficiaries directly). 

The executor has access to our deceased Aunt's account and gave us the account number for the first IRA back in February of 2019. Although there were a few bumps along the way, that account has been divided and distributed among the 5 beneficiaries. 

So here is the problem:

During the process of distributing that first IRA, one of the the representatives of the Financial company informed me that I was a beneficiary on another IRA but refused to give me any information. Our executor finally found the account number for that second IRA and we have since started the process of distribution among all 5 beneficiaries. 

During the process of distributing this second IRA, one of the beneficiaries was informed that he would be receiving funds from a Mutual Fund account as well. (Now it's possible that he is the only one who should be receiving a Mutual Fund which is fine BUT I have so many questions...) Our executor has no knowledge of this Mutual Fund.

My questions are: (1)Can I ask my neighbor if it’s okay to remove the dead trees and I’ll help pay or completely pay for the removal? (2)How do I best cover my butt for all of this tree removal (4+ trees)? Get a lawyer to draw a contract?

Shortly after I got (and paid) the tickets, and about two weeks before it was towed, I filed with the DMV to let them know that I was no longer the owner of the car. Unfortunately, I couldn't find the buyer's information at the time, so that information was incomplete, and while the DMV amended the records to say I no longer owned the car, I was still listed as the last owner of the car.

Unfortunately I can't find my copy of the Bill of Sale, I've been going through my files trying to find that. I've also been trying to contact the dealer who bought it from me. The buyer is a separate towing company and junkyard who's also (I assume, I haven't been able to verify this) a licensed dealer. , but so far they haven't been picking up their phone, and when I drove by the only one there was a junkyard dog.

While I unfortunately don't have the bill of sale (yet), I do have a copy of the registration that was signed (though not dated) by the buyer. I also contacted the third-party online company that set up the sale in the first place, which verified the date of the sale as well as the company that bought it, but refused to give me any kind of written documentation.

Right now the towing company that has my car is asking for $1200, and that amount goes up by $80 per day until it maxes out at $3500. I was tempted to just pay that amount and be done with it, but they'd require me to drive it off the lot, and I'm fairly sure I don't own it and legally can't do that. (I talked to my car insurance agent and she said she didn't think they could legally give me insurance in the car, since it's not registered in my name.)

The junkyard that's currently in possession of the car, on the other hand, is claiming that since I'm the DMV listed me as the last owner as of when they towed the car, it doesn't matter if I sold the car, or if that I updated the DMV information to include the buyer after the car was towed (which I did.) I have no idea if this is legally valid or if it's not actually true and they're just trying to nail me with fees I don't actually owe.

So, to briefly summarize: sold a car, no one filed to the DMV, car was towed, legal ownership and liability of the car are unclear, and I'm not sure if I need to pay the $1200+ fees or if I could even legally drive it off the lot if I did so.

Some of you are probably just about to chime in and tell me that all they can do is take the car, and they can't actually charge me anything. Unfortunately, while that's how it used to work, that doesn't seem to be the case anymore... a law passed in 2018 allows them to charge me for up to $3500 in fees minus whatever they get for selling the car. (It's a busted old car, so they're not likely to get more than $100-200 for it.)

I'll also note that in some counties, the towing company couldn't legally charge that much... but I'm not in one of those counties, and they're within their rights to charge $1000 for the towing plus $80 per day for storage.

So... do I own the car? Do I not own the car? Am I liable for advantages? Could I legally drive it off the lot? I'm talking to a lawyer on Tuesday, but the clock is ticking so I wanted to get some advice as soon as possible!

"An acquaintance of mine just took up residence in my backyard shed. I don't want to leave him homeless, but I want to at least have some kind of proper tenant agreement that gives me rights and makes it easier to kick him out if it comes to that.",47,dpqmw3,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dpqmw3/an_acquaintance_of_mine_just_took_up_residence_in/,68,1572570858.0,"I'll try to keep the backstory brief, but it's kinda convoluted. I paid this guy to mow my lawn a few times, and I guess he just kinda decided we were besties. I don't dislike him, but I'm just an introvert who likes being by myself most of the time, so usually I would brush him off when he wanted to hang out.

At one point, we randomly crossed paths while I was walking the dog, and somehow casual conversation turned to the subject of my house (which I own) having a room available, which someone could potentially stay in if they paid rent. Long story short, that didn't end up happening, and I didn't see him again for a while. He recently resurfaced, and we saw each other now and then until he told me that he was going to North Carolina. I thought that was the end of it, but of course he came back. 

That brings us to six days ago, when I saw him through my window carrying an office chair, so I went out there and asked him what he was doing. His answer, as I perceived it at the time, was that he just wanted a little personal spot to kinda kick back and have some alone time away from his job or whatever (he works within walking distance of my house). So I agreed to that; partially because I'm not really good at saying no, but also partially because I don't ever use my backyard or shed, so I figured if someone else got some use out of it, why the hell not? (I did make it clear that he was not permitted to smoke weed or do anything else illegal.)

Big mistake, because one of the annoying things about this guy is, if you give him an inch, he'll take a mile. If he asks to use your bathroom, he'll come in and take a shower. And apparently, if he asks to leave a chair on your back porch, he'll take up permanent residence in your shed. 

At this point, it's kind of annoying, but I do still feel bad for the guy. I still don't actually use the shed for anything (yet), and he really doesn't seem like a bad guy, he just doesn't have a great sense of boundaries. Like, he never would've even asked permission to leave the chair there if I hadn't seen him walking by and flagged him down. But he doesn't seem to understand why someone else would have a problem with that. And I'm on the autism spectrum, so I already have enough problems with not being on the same wavelength as other people. But he's not really a dick, he just operates in a different way than I do.

Anyway, the point is that I don't really want to kick him out, as long as I can clearly (and legally) define a framework that will make it harder for him to claim ""squatter's rights"" or whatever if I get fed up later and want him to leave then. I mentioned that to him and he seemed willing to sign something (as an alternative to me just kicking him out right now), but being as I'm not a lawyer, I don't know all the proper ways to phrase things so that it will be easier to maintain all my rights as the property owner, if he ever becomes less cooperative later.",47
Store manager cutting my hours after I filed a complaint with the owner of where I work.,10,dpyb8x,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dpyb8x/store_manager_cutting_my_hours_after_i_filed_a/,10,1572604696.0,"Ok, so I'm in Michigan. I work at a grocery store in the deli part. The owners of said store have about 5 other locations within surrounding counties. So not a huge corporation. They just recently purchased and took over the store in April of this year. I started the week they took over. I have 5 years of deli under my belt from my previous job and my servsafe etc. So I know what I'm doing for the most part. About 4 months in they hire in family (a husband well call D and wife well call L) to be store managers. D has not liked me since day 1. Don't know why, just on a personal level doesnt like me. Whatever, it happens. After them being there for a month I have numerous co workers approach me saying D was trash talking me. I brought it up to L and she took care of it. D apologized. I bite my tongue and treat him with respect while the whole time he treats me like dirt and continually tries to find any reason he can to write me up or fire me. Now his wife, L, has worked side by side with me while D usually just goes around the store from dept to dept. L fights D about me tooth and nail trying to have my back. I have caught D in a few lies. Usually saying things like the store owners want me gone etc. Unbeknownst to him, I talk to the owners whenever he makes these claims and they said that its untrue and to ignore him. This all comes to a head a week ago. I am having an issue with a customer. Said customer comes in numerous times a day. Asks co workers if I'm working. If I'm not, he leaves. If I am, he'll sit back in my dept and just say disgusting sexual things. My husband is upset I won't go to my manager who is D. Obviiusly you get I don't trust him much. My husband one day approachs D with respect and asked him to speak with me as I'm having issues. D pulls me to an empty isle to talk. Reluctantly I tell him what's going on. He then tells me "" I talk to *customer* every time he's in here. He wouldnt say those things"" and walks away. I felt sick. The next day the store owner is in the store. I sit down with him and explain what happens with D. He tells me he already heard and that one of the cashiers called him because they heard what D had said. He said he pulled up the store cameras (which also have audio) and heard some of the interactions with the customer and what happend with D. He apologizes and tells me D will be handled as it was inappropriate of him and illegal for him to act that way, especially without investigating the claim. He also tells me he is well aware D doesn't like me but it has nothing to do with anything work related so he doesnt know why D is the way he is with me but he will speak to him about it as well. Now yesterday, we get out new schedule. Note I'm a full time employee and am supposed to have a minimum of 36 hours at this place. D put me on 3 days a week. Meaning I only have 24 hours. Obviously I'm upset. L apologizes to me, telling me I'm doing great and she knows D is being unfair and it isn't right but there's nothing she can do as he is in charge of my dept. So today D calls me into his office. Tells me I am no longer full time but part time. His reasoning is that my husband and children are at the store a lot. I explain I'm not understanding what this has to do with anything. As my family only comes in to shop as I live in a small rural town with 1 grocery store in like a 50 mile area. I also want to add that my children are rarely in the store so I was confused. I have 4 school age children. I work 8am to 4pm mond thru Friday. So theyre in school the entire time I work. I still explain I'm confused as to what he means in regards to my job performance and why I'm being cut and all he tell a me is that if a miracle happens maybe ill get full time back. He says he knows I have a big family and I should probably find a different job with full time but he emphasizes he is not firing me. Besides myself there are 4 other employees in my dept. 1 started with me and the other 3, I myself trained per L. He couldnt give me anything I did wrong performance wise and obviously if I'm the one who trains, my performance cannot be that bad. I feel that this is retaliation and he is pushing me to quit. I have a lot of coworkers telling me I have grounds for some sort of legal action as this isn't right. Thanks for reading this if youve made it this far. Honestly I'm just confused and still in shock with what happend. I dont know what my next step should be.",10

A little background first. I'm 16 years old and currently work at Taco Bell. They have everything set up so that our paychecks go through the online money transfer site Money Network. They gave me a card, and me being the naive teenager I M, decided I wouldn't need a bank account. Well I'm pretty sure I've been played like a fiddle.

Over the few months I've worked their, I've noticed little peculiarities in my account. Having lez than what I thought I should have, account balance going down slightly after I've didn't buy anything, ect. ect. Well today, I filled my buddy's gas tank with $10 worth of gas. I had $50 in my account at this time. I go in to buy a coffee and some donuts and my card gets declined. Check my account and it's empty. 

Of course the first thing I do is call them. I go through their automated options first, pressing the button to see my recent transactions. Around $42 was transferred on Nov. 1st. This was at 9:15 on October 31st. The transaction didn't appear in the app.

So I call a customer service representative. I tell them what happend, and they replied with ""I see"". A few minutes later they hung up.

(TN)Minor hoodwinked into signing a quit claim on property he co-inherited with his bio father,36,dpr10s,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dpr10s/tnminor_hoodwinked_into_signing_a_quit_claim_on/,6,1572572514.0,"I am planning to consult with an attorney over this matter, but I wanted to get some Reddit prospective first. Names are changed.

My son’s(17M) paternal grandmother(Cee) contacted him at the beginning of Oct out of the blue, with a story of that she was holding some money $2400, that his great grandfather(Pa)left for him. His Pa passed in June 2017. Years before he passed, Pa made sure that I knew he willed my son and his bio dad his home and property, because Cee is quite the thief and involved with drugs and in and out of jail for both. Son’s bio father is currently in Federal prison for drugs. Son does not have a relationship with either of the two misfits, and has not since he was 5, but did have a great relationship with his Pa when he was younger, but lost touch with him as he grew up, and we moved about 100 miles away. Pa was a very good and honest man. 

After my son told me about Cee contacting him offering money, I was very sure to warn him of her character, and told him to not get his hopes up about anything. He said he knows, and that he’ll go along to see what comes of it. I did mention to him what Pa told me of years ago about the house. He says that Cee told him that’s not what this money is from, and that the house is in the bio fathers name only. Cee tells son she needs him to sign something, in order for her atty to release a check, but that it had to be notarized. He drives 50 miles to meet Cee halfway at a notary service on 10/18(I had no idea all of this was taking place), and he signs whatever she says to, and Cee tells him that he have his check soon. Son says he remembers that the bio dad’s name was on the document too, but wasn’t signed. 

A week goes by and I assume son asks her about the check status and Cee gives him the runaround saying she’s in FL, but she’ll be back on 10/30 and she’ll give it to him then. Yesterday he tried to confirm what time to meet, and Cee comes clean and tells son it was all a lie to get him to sign off on his inheritance. Son contacted the notary service to find out if she remembered him, and had a record of what it was he signed and she said that it looked like a quit claim deed to her and that he came in with his “mother”. It’s only now when son wants to involve me and let me know fully what’s going on. 

My husband contacted Cee last night to ask her what is going on, since I was seeing red, and she sent a text back saying “You people don’t deserve anything my dad had and never will.”  The property is run down, maybe worth about $13K if I’m being extra generous since there are 2 lots. The house itself would need to be bulldozed down. It wasn’t Cee’s choice to make on who deserved what, as Pa had a will, and that is what I’m furious about. I looked online, and property taxes have not been paid since 2016 as well. 

I could care less about whatever money son would receive, as I honestly figured they lost the property years ago, due to Cee and the bio dad’s history. It’s really about principle to me. This woman strung my son(her only grandchild) along for a month with a promise of something only to be tricked into giving up his interest in the only thing his Pa had to leave for him. If son would’ve involved me, he would not be in this situation, and I would already have an lawyer to negotiate for him if she was trying to sell property or whatever the heck this woman is trying to do. 

Is a minor able to revoke his signature on a quit claim deed if he didn’t know what he was (tricked into)signing? I’m sure the deed has been recorded now(not sure what the law is with inmates and property), since Cee finally came clean with the truth. Should I get a copy of the will before consulting an attorney, or am I just wasting my effort on a lost cause? Thank you for any advice.",36
Was ripped off by moving company and am beginning the process of getting my money back,1,dq4chb,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dq4chb/was_ripped_off_by_moving_company_and_am_beginning/,1,1572644290.0,"We recent moved from Iowa to Maryland and hired a moving company to move us. The company we went with is both a broker and a moving company and is based in Florida. I decided to go with them because on the phone they assured me they only brokered when people were outside their normal routes, and that we were on a popular route so it would 100% be their trucks and men we'd deal with on pickup and delivery. I hate dealing with third party people so that sounded good to me. Naive.

I signed a binding estimate with them based on an estimated 375 cubic feet and gave them a small $180 deposit, with rest payable upon delivery.

Day of pickup a truck arrives from a third party company, without any prior warning despite the contract saying they'd tell us. I decided to just let it go because this moving company was highly rated so surely they'd hire reputable third party movers. Wrong.

The movers proceed to tell us we actually had 3x as much stuff as we'd estimated. We decide to leave all of our big furniture behind and still come out 25 cu ft over our original estimate. We sign a new binding estimate and bill of lading and are on our way.

Fast forward a couple weeks and our things are delivered. 99% of everything actually arrived in tact which is amazing, but before unpacking we measured everything and found that we actually had only moved 180-200 cubic feet of things but paid for 400 cu ft. If wed brought our furniture I'm guessing it would have been right on the money for our original estimate.

I called the brokerage straight away and the rep sounded genuinely upset that the movers would do something like that. She is requesting documentation from them and had me send her a write up of my experience with them, photos of everything that had been delivered and estimates of how many cubic feet it was. I'm current waiting on a response. I'm not looking to be reimbursed for anything except the money we overpaid.

I'd really like to keep a good relationship with this broker unless absolutly necessary because suing someone in small claims from out of state is incredibly tricky. That being said, I absolutly will if I have to. Is there anything moving forward that I should or shouldn't do to prepare for a possible conflict? I was hesitant to give her all my testimony and evidence but decided it was worth it in the end.",1

They are not married.

She is currently not employed, but he is. For the safety of the child (which is 1 year old), the child has been placed with family members so her father can work as there are no care-takers that can watch the child.

Currently the mother of child has left the home (lease is in both the father’s and mother’s name) and is presumably residing with friends/family.

The kicker here is that the mother is constantly contacting police authority and stating that the father has kidnapped the child (he did not and this is factual. The mother abandoned both), and at the same time is attempting to threaten him with getting a restraining order.

Questions:

Can she file for a restraining order, and would he be notified of it before it takes effect? 

Would there need to be sufficient support (evidence that he should not be around her) to bolster a claim for a restraining order?

Can a father file for a paternity test and attempt to win custody over the child?

Need wisdom in complicated family court matter.,0,dq485n,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dq485n/need_wisdom_in_complicated_family_court_matter/,0,1572643668.0,"Hello All!

I'm posting this on behalf of a friend that won't reach out for advice.  I'm going to try to post as much information as possible, but in as few words as possible. 

Here's what I know:

-divorced couple with 2 minor children. 

Male is living in South Florida in the ""family"" home. 

Ex wife moved to another state with the two minor children. 

-There is a parenting plan in effect in the State of Florida. 

-Parental alienation is occurring. 

-contempt filed during divorce proceedings against fw due to absconding with the children to other state. 

-post divorce there has been interference from fw with stipulated contact in established parenting plan that she agreed to. Most contact between children and dad had been interfered with. 

-fh filed a second contempt motion due to repeated interfered contact and other issues pertaining to parenting plan. 

-fw filed retaliatory contempt in response to fh contempt filing (expected). 

-court date in FL to address contempt in early 2020

-fw then filed for temporary restraining order in the state she lives. He had plans to visit his children that she blocked with the TRO. 

-he has abided by all terms concerning the tro. He has not spoken to his children. 

-he has a lawyer in her state and will travelling to that state only to fight TRO 

-dad has not spoken to his children in over two weeks. 


So about the TRO, I read what she wrote. The filing is filled with fabrications. We went through this thing line for line, it's a huge lie. He has kept impeccable records of the entire divorce process, emails, texts, videos (fw began recording calls between kids and dad and can't undo the recording thing so all contact has been recorded) and a ""divorce diary"", so there's evidence to back his defense. He has a lawyer to fight the TRO so what are the chances that with adequate representation the tro will not be made permanent? 

How can this TRO affect his contempt filing in Florida, her counter filing. And most importantly, what about the kids? They are tied up in all of this too. What most likely (I meant to say could happen but I want my text to stay intact) will happen to them or for them? 

The friends attorneys really aren't talking much to him and he's becoming impatient. He's upset about his kids. I told him that the attorneys are doing their job to defend him, that they won't tell him their plans because he wouldn't understand why they're ""playing the game"" the way they're playing. He thinks they are ignoring him, I told him they aren't contributing to his conversation because lawyers don't do their lawyer thing based on emotion, they work off of statute and precident.. This person is a wreck, do any of you lovely people have any words of wisdom? 


Thank you for reading this. Have a wonderful day.

Questions about confidentiality,1,dq46dh,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dq46dh/questions_about_confidentiality/,4,1572643410.0,"I was working for a nonprofit in New York. We have a handbook that everyone signs upon employment. In the handbook, there is a small paragraph about confidentiality. It plainly says that everything about the foundation is confidential and talking about the foundation to anyone external is strictly prohibited. 

There are a lot of shady things and it was a very hostile work environment. There was no discrimination against gender, age, race ect. But there was definitely an environment full of fear and hostility. It is a small foundation of 8 people and there was no HR. There was no one to talk to about the hostility.

I was overseeing some programs we funded. The last week I worked there, we had a board meeting and the executive director told me to lie and say we were funding double the programs we actually were. This was said verbally, I don't have any written evidence.

A few days later, I was being scolded in front of the office and it was my breaking point. I made the decision to quit after I was told to lie to the board but I actually left a few days later.

My question is: if I file for unemployment and explain that I was uncomfortable lying and that the environment was too hostile and I didn't have an HR department to help me... would that be breaching confidentiality? Additionally, there were some shady things they were doing with donation money (founders would fund their own personal vacations ect), would I be in trouble if one day I anonymously whistleblew?",1

"I work for a large financial corporation that perpetually ""loses"" my commissions.

My income is 100% commission-based on a variety of financial products.  As an employee, I do not receive clear accounting of my commissions for a month.  I have access to to thousands of line items for all of my commissions each month, but many of the line items are named ""CUST UNKNOWN"" or ""ACCT # 00000000.""  This makes it impossible for me to consistently track.

About once or twice per year, my monthly commissions will suddenly drop by $5-10,000.  Every time my commissions drop it is always from the ""CUST UNKNOWN"" portion of my take home, making it impossible to track.  My company has a service department to handle these things but every time I speak with them it is the same conversation:

Me: My commissions appear to be missing X amount of dollars based on usual take home.

Co:  What client is it?  Can you prove it’s missing?

Me: I don’t know, the funds missing are usually labeled Customer Unknown

Co: Well, how are we supposed to help if you cannot prove anything is missing?

Sometimes I am able to dig into all of the products sold and figure it out, but sometimes I can't.  Since I've started working here I've probably had $60,000 or more go unpaid.  I've recovered about $45,000 of that amount but the remaining $15,000 was simply too difficult to prove or too small to spend time on. Not to mention, I can't imagine how much has gone unpaid that was too tiny for me to even notice on a monthly basis.

I'm currently in the process of trying to prove another chunk is missing but it looks like this chunk of change will never be recovered.  I've gotten managers involved, and I even spoke to some of the company leadership at one point, but nothing has ever changed.  What else can I do?  Can the DOL help?

Employer has sent me a very legal sounding email saying that they are terminating my employment immediately under a clause of not doing my duties and withholding my last month's salary,15,dpv5gs,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dpv5gs/employer_has_sent_me_a_very_legal_sounding_email/,3,1572589775.0,"As short as I can make it, they wanted to fire me because they said they can't afford my wages. We entered discussions a few days ago around a potential settlement agreement. I got concerned when it appeared that in this agreement, they wanted my last month's salary to be included in the settlement and dependent on me completing an adequate handover. I thought that I was entitled to that salary whatever happens as they gave me notice to terminate yesterday.

When earlier on today I said no thanks I'd rather have my due wages paid and we can discuss a settlement agreement for my remaining 30 days notice they sent me a very worrying email.

This email said:
We've tried hard to find a compromise and that they told me of their concerns with my performance 4 weeks ago (I wouldn't say that one version of an agreement is trying hard..yes they raised concerns4 weeks ago but not around my performance, they said that they thought the company product wasn't ready for market so didn't need a sales director. I asked them for 4 weeks to see if we can sell the current unfinished product. Hint... I did.).
The agreement is standard and enabled me to benefit more from it (it wasn't and it didn't. It gave me the exact same obligations and remuneration as I would have if they gave me notice and worked it, but without any rights as an employee).
We have invested heavily in me and paid for information that they want back (I don't think they have invested much but yeah sure I never said I wouldn't return all assets and data to them)
We have concerns regarding your activity which isn't what they would expect as a benchmark of a Sales Director (this is new to me)
We have not offered to give you notice and we won't because your termination falls under clause X which says you haven't performed your duties (seems pretty unfair to me)
We're getting legal advice on your performance, attendance and time worked for us as we are concerned about your efforts (wtf I am super professional, fiercely loyal and really hard working)
Given your response we consider you a flight risk with information that we have heavily invested in (lol)
Until we understand our position legally we are not processing any payments.
We suggest you consider employment is immediately terminated and will be in touch with lawyers and facts.

I'm in the UK, work for a very early stage tech startup since August.

There has been little management and nothing ever in writing from these guys.

I'll add that yesterday they tried to claim that they gave me my notice 4 weeks ago.

On the topic of ""information"" they are referring to a LinkedIn campaign that they paid an agency to run from my personal account and generating contacts and leads.

I am seriously surprised as this went from 0-100 in one afternoon, after I declined to sign their awfully unfavourable settlement agreement.

When we moved in we agreed that the meter will go under my name and he will just pay me half regardless of who uses more electricity. A few months im he would call me at night and tell me to lower the central AC in the summer or heater in the winter which got annoying so i adjusted the heat/ac to his liking whenever he complained. 

I eventually ended up buying a window AC and an electric heater because we obviously have different body temperature. He complained that i had the window ac on too much and that he will no longer pay half but instead 25% of it. I stoped using the window ac and just dealt with his bs. Today he came into my apt while my gf was here and installed a plastic key cover over the ac/heater control so that its always on auto. I called him and told him that i am assuming he will now be paying more for electricity since i can no longer control the temperature in my own apt that i pay rent for and he said no. 

I am livid at this point. There has to be something i can do to put this guy in his place. Obviously i am now currently online looking for another place. But someone please help me out with suggestions or what i could possibly do.

Losing my family farm,123,dpliht,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dpliht/losing_my_family_farm/,15,1572546016.0,"I am a small grains and pulse crop farmer located in North-Eastern Montana.

TLDR:

A mid-season policy change in a disaster-level crop insurance policy will likely be the final stake in losing my farm.

My farm was in a very tight financial position last spring.  A government program was available that offered disaster level insurance on planting a crop that does not grow well in my area.  The guaranteed return on this program was significantly higher than I could have made planting other crops.  I enrolled in this program, borrowing money to plant this crop using this disaster insurance program guarantee as well as other assets as collateral.

As expected, the crop produced poorly.  The government agency realized that the level of production they offered on the policy was inflated and wants to reduce the covered insurance amount.  This will reduce my farm's revenue for the year by approximately $50,000.  Without this money I will not be able to make my term debt payments for a second year in a row and likely have to sell my family's farm and home.

So I received a phone call Tuesday afternoon and was told that if I do not sign paperwork acknowledging the reduced coverage by the end of today, (10-31), they will not cover my crop at all.

My summary pretty well covers my situation.  There are a lot of complications with financing and I obtain my financing mostly through the same organization that offers the program I spoke about.  This program is the only reason I was offered financing for another year.  When I signed up for the program, I was given a sheet with my per acre guaranteed dollar value.  The worker that accepted my entry into the program signed her copy of the same sheet in front of me, but the copy I received did not have her signature on it, just a date stamp.

Dozens of other farmers in my area are facing the same issue.  Tens of millions of dollars were spent on crop inputs as a result of this program.  The new lower guarantee amount is enough to cover the cost of these inputs in most situations, but does not cover the profit margin that I needed in order to make my term debt payments and break even for the year.  The other farmers that I have spoken to are all accepting the change to avoid  conflict with the organization as they rely on it for a lot of other programs.

Should I take on a legal fight with a federal government agency over this $50,000 because it would cause the loss of my family farm?  Virtually all of my personal assets are at risk.  If I do sell the farm and related assets, I will have a significant capital gains tax liability that will likely consume most of the equity that I have in the property.  I do have a salaried position off farm that I have held for almost a year now, but it would barely provide enough for my family to get by if we were to lose our home.   My wife is at her end after several years of financial stress and is threatening divorce.  She is attending college online and would like to move as far away from this farm as she can get.  We do not have the resources to do so and I like the job that I have.

I do not have an existing relationship with a lawyer.  Legal resources in my small town are limited.  I do not know of any lawyers in the area that have experience in agricultural programs.

Thank you so very much for reading this and for any help you may offer.  May you have a beautiful day!",123

Grasping at straws I called the local septic company to see if they had any idea. On the phone, they told me they didn’t have that information but alerted me that in May of this year they were called out because the septic flowed back into the house.

He suggested I dig up the tank to see if it was overfull, and it was. I had it pumped and have since then contacted my realtor, a few lawyers for consultations, and the septic company several times asking for service records and any notes describing why they were called, etc. The septic company now hangs up on me since I’ve mentioned talking to lawyers (not even trying to go after them, I just want the damn notes).

2. Health issues.  I lost 50 pounds when he first left me.  I was malnourished according to my doctor, some of my hair fell out (it is better now) but I had to buy four wigs that were not cheap.
3. Redecoration costs.  I had to get rid of everything that was in his office/man cave (where he spent hours texting the whore) and redecorate.  Cost me about $1200 total.
4. Hair Club membership.  See hair falling out above - and of course how am I going to find a new partner with no hair?  This is working really well but it cost me $5000.
5. New clothes for weight loss (see 2 above), about $600.
6. Ongoing harassment from my HOA.  My yard is a mess, I have to work obviously and I'm now on one income so I can't afford to pay the landscaper any more.  I'm 50 and can hardly be expected to trim palm trees myself, but now I'm getting fine letters from my HOA (see 1 above!)
7. Loss of future income.  I was in a certification program when he left me which would have allowed me to apply for a promotion at work.  I had to quit this program because I could not bear the cost along with the loss of his income.  At least $10,000 year in lost income.

My wife began working at a medium-sized company in Seattle, WA.  She was doing product development for them.  Last year, she got a new boss who instantly did not like my wife, for some reason.  This was noticed by co-workers and nobody could explain it.  In March of last year, my wife and I found out we were pregnant.  My wife disclosed this to the company when she reached around three months.  Shortly after that, her boss called her in for a meeting and basically said my wife should consider taking a position somewhere else within the company when she comes back from maternity leave.  My wife was pretty upset about that, but she moved on.  

Well, yesterday, 10/31/19, she went in to work and was called into a room with her boss and somebody from HR.  Her boss basically said, ""I hoped you would improve, but you haven't improved."" And fired her.  My wife was devastated and they basically coerced her into signing a form that stated she agreed it was her last day and her last paycheck would be issued to this date.  It also stated her health insurance would terminate on the last day of the current month (ie. at midnight..).  This was completely out of the blue and the company has absolutely no documentation of poor performance at all.  

They let her leave the building without a copy of the form she signed, and no information about how to obtain unemployment benefits or COBRA health care.  She is in her 7th month of pregnancy.

Rumor has it they also recently asked an HR employee who was on maternity leave to not return following her leave.  That employee resigned while on maternity leave.  

Yesterday and this morning I am scrambling through the steps of getting her added to my health insurance, which luckily is an option.  Still doesn't feel great we woke up today with no health insurance for her or our baby.  I'm seething as I'm writing this...

There are two of them and one of them caused a bunch of chaos and was very unprofessional and texting some of the teachers some inappropriate rude comments. She was transferred to another district and my friend was out right fired. First they told her they didn’t have the funding anymore for her position. she told them that the school didn’t pay for her position it was actually a grant. She can show them last year‘s grant but when she went to get this years grant they are giving her the runaround and she believes it’s because one of the higher ups at the school has talked to them into not providing that. 
Then their new reason was they told her she was part of the spreading rumors and drama. Which she absolutely wasn’t and there is no proof of that. And the fact of the matter is they are just firing her before they can prove anything and so it feels like a very lame excuse and I would like to either prevent it from happening or at the very least hold this district responsible.  Another reason they gave was that she makes one of the employees uncomfortable. Ironically that employee that said that makes everyone else uncomfortable and everyone else completely disagrees with that notion about my friend.
And because they’re very first reason they gave was the lack of funds excuse I feel like there’s some kind of legal recourse if she’s able to prove she has that Grant. She has a representative helping her through this process but I was just wondering if there’s anything you guys could do to help.

At the end of the fight two of his friends were chasing me and I ran to a friends house. Later his bigger brother found my Instagram and texted me to talk with my parents, and because I was scared I kept it hidden from them, once my parents found out the kid's parents had already went to the police and now I risk being charged with bodily harm/battery. The kid had a ripped ear, a hole at the back of his head and scratches on the face and back, while I got out with a busted lip and small bruises.

Can I Take Legal Action Against This Debt Collector?,4,dpyqqo,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dpyqqo/can_i_take_legal_action_against_this_debt/,1,1572607054.0,"I live in Texas if that is pertinent information.  

This evening I received a call from a debt collector about a balance of $397.00 that was due to be payed to a doctor's office in May. I realize this is not a large amount, but I am currently trying to juggle a lot of other medical bills as well.  

I sincerely intend to pay every bill and I had just forgotten about this one because it was the only remaining bill that is listed on a separate insurance plan due to our company being acquired by another company. 

This evening the first gentlemen that I spoke to told me that I had to make a $50.00 payment by the time they closed at 8:00 pm in order for them not to hit my credit score with a negative claim (or something like that). The time was 7:43 pm and I panicked because I had already made my budget for this pay period and I wasn't sure how paying them the $50.00 would effect everything else I needed to pay before my next check.   

I asked him if I could do $25.00 instead because I was worried about other bills that I had to pay. He said no, it was $50.00 or nothing. I was quiet for a few minutes trying to decide if I should just let it hit my credit score or go ahead and pay the $50.00 and maybe work something out with one of my other bills. Then I asked him if it would be $50.00 a month from here on out and also was there maybe someone i could talk to about paying a lower payment a month. He said they did not accept payments lower than $50.00 and yes I would be paying $50.00 a month from now on.   

I was fishing around in my purse for my bank card and asking him how I was going to be making the payment today when he told me that he was wrong and they couldn't accept less than $132.00 today and I would need to pay the balance off in three installments. I panicked again and started sounding very agitated which I now regret but couldn't help at the time. I said that wasn't what we had just agreed upon and that I would like to speak to a manager.  

I was transferred to an incredibly rude woman who informed me that she was the manager. I started trying to explain what had just happened but she told me that I needed to stop talking. I became more agitated and asked her how I was supposed to resolve the situation if she wasn't going to hear what I had to say. She gave me a spiel about being a debt collector and the call being monitored and then told me that if I hadn't been talking she could have told me that she had been standing over the guy's shoulder and telling him to tell me about the new amount that I owed immediately.  

I asked her why I suddenly owed a new amount and she told me it was because of the age of the account. I told her that I thought she should honor a $50.00 payment today because it had already been agreed upon. She became very testy and told me that fine, she would accept $50.00 today but I would owe the rest of the entire amount next month. I asked her why, shouldn't it be broken into two more installments? She said no, now I would owe the entire amount next month. I again asked her why because that didn't make sense, she had just told me that the payments would be broken into 3 installments.  

She said that the 3rd installment was only for hardship payments and that if I payed only $50.00 tonight it would no longer be considered a hardship. I was incredibly agitated by this point. I told her that it was obvious that I was having trouble making the payment by not being able to pay her first installment amount fully. She said it didn't matter, I would make the payment in full next month or it would hit my credit score.   

I asked her if I could obtain a copy of this phone call and she said no, the recordings were not available to the public. I asked her if an attorney could obtain a recording of the phone call and she all but yelled at me asking what my attorney's name was. I told her that I didn't have representation yet but I was considering finding one. She said she didn't see how I would afford an attorney if I couldn't even pay the $397.00 that I owed them. I asked her who the general manager was and what their contact information was. She gave me and extension and said I could talk to him in the morning. Then she reiterated that, however once this was reported against my credit score it could not be retracted and snapped at me to have a good night. I hung up.  

Throughout our conversation she stated that once they reported this account against my credit score, the report could not be retracted. I felt like she was doing her best to intimidate me into making the payment she wanted me to make instead of the amount of $50.00 first agreed upon.   

Would any of this conversation violate the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act?  

If they are in violation, what would be my best course of action first?  

I feel like the woman was making an arbitrary decision in making me pay the full amount next month if I only payed them $50.00 this month. I'm wondering if there might be a way to work out lower payments with them somehow. I feel like they need to be put in check. This woman overstepped some boundaries.  

  

Please note that I am sorry for any grammar or spelling errors. I am incredibly tired tonight.",4

In our lease it states that after our lease is up, if we don’t renew, we have to vacate the premises and everything on it within 7 days. Anything left behind is deemed the landlords to do with it as they see fit. 

We’re a seasonal business so our lease was May-August, but our landlords just served us the letter, basically saying we have 7 days from receiving the letter to move out. Is this legally enforceable? We were wanting to sell the business, but it seems like with this method our landlords can just steal it from us, as we have no way to move the building it’s in off the property. 

Oh yeah, and one thing I didn’t mention is we never even signed the lease for this season. We didn’t do it on purpose, we just got busy and forgot about it, and our landlord never brought it up so we just stayed open and continued business as usual. If we bring this to their attention, could they try to say we were trespassing on their land?

Me and K married 2 years ago and had a child shortly after. He is now 20 months old.

For context, I am an Italian immigrant who found job in the US, while my wife is American. I am the sole owner of the house, and we split the bills. 

Long story short, I have received an anonymous message on a social media, from what it looked like a burn account. The message went into a deep detailed story on how this individual saw my wife K and a stranger (I’ll call him S) having sex at his house. My thinking is that the message comes from a roommate of S who now moved and feels free to tip me over without fearing repercussions from S. This is somehow implied in the message.

As far as proof of infidelity, I have only this message saved as screenshot.

I’ve done my researches on S and found out he is a real person. He is the kind of guy who’s on and off jail for drugs. I am unable to determine how he and my wife know each other but that’s irrelevant I think.

I had the DNA test performed for paternity and found out that the kid is not my son.

I am doing my best to set my emotions aside and avoid talking to my wife about it. It is easy as now I am in the UK for a month. I want to use this month best I can to prepare a case for divorce.

How should I go about it? Obv contact a lawyer but I take any advices.

I want off the hook of child support. I have recognized him as my son at birth (sigh) but ideally I want to pay 0 child support and have them both removed from my house. 

My wife is salaried okish, can afford a place on her own, and also she can move back with her parents who’ll help so having her and the child moved out shouldn’t be an issue.",76

Eventually the city put in a stop sign. I requested them build a barrier or alter the intersection physically.

I don’t currently live in NC, but this job I’m in the process of applying for is. The job title was “legal writing associate” at an immigration firm and the description online was somewhat vague, listing duties such as research, proofreading, and writing. 

I was given a grammar assessment based off my application materials, and passed. I then was given a phone screen, where they gave me the run down of the job. Basically, I would be ghost writing letters of recommendation for scientists from outside the US looking to secure work VISAs for the US. I would be given the applicant’s portfolio and the name of the alleged recommender, would compose the recommendation letter myself based on the portfolio, and then sign the name of the recommender. I was told there would be attorneys working in the same office with me, but not to bother them with any questions about the letters and to just look them up online instead. I was also told I would need to use different fonts and formats for each letter to make them look unique.

This comes across as unethical to me. However, I know basically nothing about immigration law and procedures in cases like these. Is any of this actually legally dubious, or is it fine and I’m just being overly concerned here?",16

I was prescribed a tricyclic antidepressant by a gastroenterologist without warning of the effects.,0,dq47fd,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dq47fd/i_was_prescribed_a_tricyclic_antidepressant_by_a/,1,1572643558.0,"To provide some background, I have chronic stomach issues which I’m currently working with the Mayo Clinic to fix. Locally in Indiana, I have seen two GI doctors with little luck as well as several other specialists. My last GI, or rather his Nurse Practitioner, from Indiana prescribed the drug Amitriptyline to supposedly treat my nausea symptomatically. The nurse practitioner was very careful to explain that the drug was an antidepressant but that was not what I was being treated for and the dosage was too low to have that kind of effect.
So, I began taking my medication and did not really think about it for a while. All of a sudden, around 3 weeks into taking it I started having a lot of strange problems that i dismissed to stress. Mainly, I was incredibly irritable and prone to snap on people, which is very much not like me. I walked out of my job, I yelled at several people, all very out of character for me.
This left me feeling very confused and I began having a bit of an identity crisis until I realized that those symptoms began right around the time period it takes antidepressants to work, about 2-4 weeks. So I spoke with someone who had taken the medication before and she told me that it caused suicidal ideation for her, which is very abnormal. Next I spoke with my psychology professor and he agreed that it sounded like I was a text book example of someone who did not need antidepressants taking them. I also did some of my own research and found some people having more adverse reactions than I did from half the dose I took. 
After uncovering a whole bunch of scary research on amitriptyline, I have several concerns with the manor in which I was prescribed it. Primarily, I was explicitly informed that I was not being treated for depression, and that the only reason I was being prescribed it was to hopefully get the weight gain side effect; however, in a later phone call with my primary care physician, the nurse practitioner disclosed that they were essentially trying to medicate me for mental issues on the side. Another large concern I have is that I have moderate anxiety, mild depression, and OCD clearly stated in my medical records. Shouldn’t someone who has mental health concerns that were never quite pinpointed be at least evaluated psychiatrically before being prescribed a rather outdated antidepressant? The aspect that makes me the most angry is that I was not even warned of the side effects, especially when among those are hallucinations and delusions. Had I been comprehensively informed about the medication, I may not have had such an adverse reaction. Without being told that it took me much longer than it should have to pinpoint the cause of my distress. Is this malpractice? Is a gastroenterologist allowed to do this and tell the patient that they are not being treated mentally but tell the physician otherwise?",0

Is there any legal considerations to this process? Or is it entirely fine to send (probably small amounts of) money to an individual?

Thank you in advance.

PS: I also have very little idea on what the taxes, expected waiting time and procedures to do this are but I guess that's outside the scope of this subreddit.",2

I did a general Google search, and found little dribs and drabs of information. Nothing definitive  , but there  was an article in the New York Times about 15 years ago that came up with a bit of information but it mostly stated that there is no enforcement on this issue. I kept searching and found little else.  

One last item, out of our  12 vehicles none routinely go into New Jersey for any reason. We deliver our product in New York only. Perhaps one car once a week my go to Jersey for something special but that amounts to less than 1% of the fleet time/miles driven.

Marriage is real, we have a ton of wedding photos and other family photos. I'm applying for a green card and our case is totally standard, no complications of any kind. Apart for one. 

While on my F1 visa, although I was legally being paid by the university as a science PhD student (RA/TA), I was not allowed to work anywhere else. However, I've been dog sitting on Rover for about 2 years (for those who may not know, it's like Uber but for dog sitting). In total over two years, I made about 3k$. It's not much, and I actually had all payments be made to my now-husband's PayPal. He has paid all taxes on these earnings (well, I sent him the money to pay them).

As I'm in the process of applying for a green card I'm not sure whether to mention this illegal work. This could undermine my chance at getting my green card. Yet, if they have any chance of discovering it, it may be better for me to bring it up first on my forms. 

I'm applying for my green card using Boundless, a service that sets you up with an online attorney who fills all your forms and checks your application. She seems to think I should have it on my application, but I believe she has to say that, so I'm hoping for other points of view.

&#x200B;

My questions are:

\- Do they have any way of discovering my Rover work? I did sign up for Rover using my SSN, to allow them to do a background check. 

\- If not, would you recommend I bring up this illegal work on my application?

\- If you think I should, is this likely to undermine by chance of getting my green card?

Not sure if I am posting to the right spot so if my post could be better answered somewhere else I would appreciate being directed there. Thank you!!

Long story short I lent my boyfriend over 1000$. He has agreed to sign a contract to return the money to me by a set date if I write one up. He is not aware that I know he is cheating and that I intend to break up with him as soon as the contract is signed. I told him that the reason I want a contract is to cover both of us because we have both lent money to people in the past and been screwed over. I am in school and he is trying to get into school so that was also a part of my reasoning for needing to make sure I get my money back.

TL;DR: So my question is how can I write up a contract that will be legitimate so that I can save my ass if he decides to screw me over after I leave him? Also would it be legal to record us having a conversation about signing the document?

This is urgent because he is currently waiting outside for me to tell him to come inside. He thinks I am asleep right now.

I feel like I have screwed myself over and will never be lending money to anyone ever again. I would really appreciate help to get out of this predicament because I can not wait to never see his face again.",2

The neighbors agreed to cover the vet bill. I left them alone about the amount at first trying to be a good neighbor, but when I asked when I could expect payment they told me that the dog's owner doesn't live there. I asked for the owner's contact information, which they refused to give me. I asked for their contact information, and they also refused. This animal had lived on the property for a long time, so I suspect they are lying and that the animal is likely disallowed on their lease, pitbulls usually are around here. I contacted the property owner via certified mail (we're each renting duplexes, but not under the same owner/building) to try and get their information and inform them about the dangerous animal being kept on the property. The landlord for my neighbor's property told me they couldn't provide the names of the leaseholders, but they made clear to the tenants that the animal was not be present on property again. I also attempted to send a certified letter to the neighbors at the names listed in the white pages, but that was returned as undeliverable.

Obviously they have no intention of paying, so time to go to small claims. How can I file a small claim against someone if I don't have their name? Can I file against something like ""Tenant of \[ADDRESS\]"" ? Should I file a claim against the landlords based on their liable tenants or will that be a waste of time/filing fees?

The main issue is that I don’t want to complete this process due to privacy concerns (they want me to send in photos of my self and other highly personal info), and I likely couldn’t complete the verification if I wanted to since I don’t have a stable permanent address. They have told me that I will lose access to my money if not withdrawn by December. 

Are they legally allowed to keep my funds if not withdrawn by this date? Surely it’s still my money regardless? Do I have any recourse otherwise? Would like to know if anyone has any experience with things like this.

[CA] Neighbor’s elderly parent keeps trying to steal my family’s dog,123,dpi9yt,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dpi9yt/ca_neighbors_elderly_parent_keeps_trying_to_steal/,13,1572523347.0,"My neighbor takes care of her mother who seems to have some form of diminished mental capacity (possibly dementia). Several years ago, one of her two small dogs died. They were both white shih tzu’s. Our dog is a completely different color and breed. 

Ever since her dog passed, the elderly woman has spent at least 30 minutes a day, multiple days a week, walking up and down our street calling for her “missing” dog. My family dog barks at the woman, causing her to come up to our fence or even our front door and insist that OUR dog is HER missing dog. Even after we show her the dog looks nothing like her old dog, she will linger on our property and argue that our dog belongs to her. This has been happening multiple times a week for the past 3+ years. 

She managed to break into our backyard while no one was home and stole our dog. When we got home and realized what had happened, we confronted her and she claimed she did not know where our dog was, while hiding our dog behind her front door and pointing out her (other, living) dog. Eventually her daughter came home from work and made her give our dog back. This was almost two years ago. Since then she hasn’t (to my knowledge) tried to break in again. 

Today, however, while looking for her missing dog, she opened my front door. It was unlocked. It was past dark, our front porch light wasn’t on, and the woman opened the door to my house and was about to come in until I caught her. When we called her daughter, she let us know that she was at work and wouldn’t be home until later. It seems that every occurrence of this has been while her daughter is at work. 

My family understands how difficult it can be to take care of an elderly parent, and didn’t want to cause our neighbor any trouble by calling authorities, but tonight has been a wake up call that some kind of action needs to be taken.
What authorities can we contact? Do we need to provide more than our personal accounts of this happening? What more can we do to ensure that this stops?",123

Bought a house with ex-boyfriend,1,dq0ccu,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dq0ccu/bought_a_house_with_exboyfriend/,3,1572617298.0,"Hi there, I don’t post much so sorry if this isn’t well written. 

Back story: 
My boyfriend (now ex) and I bought a house to renovate together since the housing market is booming. We purchased it from a friend of a friend and they gave us a decent deal on it. It didn’t have a foundation so we had to get a private loan. This is important- both of our names are on this loan. We pay interest only payments every month. Both of our names are also on the deed of trust for the house. It is under a right of survivorship. We both live in Oregon 

I have sank about 10k in the house already since we are building it from the floor up. He has put in roughly 7k maybe and has coordinated a lot of the work. I help in every way I can but at this stage there is not much I can do since we are waiting for the foundation to be poured. He talks down to me and has honestly made this whole process shitty. I fear that he might try to screw me over somehow. Either by inflating the prices of materials/labor or somehow sign the mortgage over without me and keep all the money to himself. I really hope it wouldn’t come to me having to take him to court. So legal reddit I have some questions:

Since it is right of survivorship does that mean that both of us still have to sign the house over?

Is there anything I can do to make sure I get my 50% of the profits like we previously agreed to?? 

Is there anything I can do to make sure that I have to be in person to sign the house over instead of over email? 

I know I’m dumb for buying a house with someone I’m not married to so please don’t come for me lol

"Is my county jail breaking the law, or am I interpreting this new state law incorrectly?",12,dpqhq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dpqhq8/is_my_county_jail_breaking_the_law_or_am_i/,9,1572570247.0,"To start, my mother is currently incarcerated in the jail in my county. I live in Tennessee, USA. 

My mother and I talk on the phone weekly. During one of our conversations she shared some frustrations that were alarming to me. She told me that while in custody she had started her menstrual cycle, soiling her clothes. She then requested clean undergarments and clothes and was not accommodated for days. This means my mother spent several days in soiled clothes and undergarments. She also mentioned how she needed more funds to purchase feminine hygiene products. This set off alarms in my head because I remembered reading about a new law in TN requiring the provision of feminine hygiene products to incarcerated women.

Here is the [link where the law is listed](https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/tccy/documents/leg/legislat.pdf). (SB75/HB129)

Here is a PDF of the law's [detailed description](https://documentcloud.adobe.com/link/track?uri=urn%3Aaaid%3Ascds%3AUS%3A66c0a1fd-3b3b-4c85-afb4-58e1657cdacd).

If, for whatever reason, the links don't work, the SB75/HB129 summary states that the law ""Requires custodians to make healthcare products available to women incarcerated in a correctional facility at no cost and in a quantity that is appropriate to the needs of the woman without a medical permit. Defines ""healthcare products"" to include feminine hygiene products, moisturizing soap that is not lye-based, toothbrushes, toothpaste, and any other healthcare product a custodian deems appropriate. (Amendment Summary) House amendment 2 (008710) limits this bill's requirements to state correctional facilities and adds that this bill does not establish a minimum standard or otherwise create a private right of action concerning the products supplied to a person incarcerated in a state correctional facility.

If this is the law, was it broken in my mother's situation? If the law says healthcare products must be provided at no cost, why is my mother under the impression that she needs to pay for these things? If the law says healthcare products must be provided in a quantity appropriate to the needs of the woman, was the law not broken when she was not accommodated for days? I admit I'm having some difficulty interpreting what exactly the amendment means, which is why I included the possibility that I'm misinterpreting it. If the institution is violating the law, what should I do from here to take action? Is it worth it?

Huge thanks in advance to all who read and respond. This jail has a history of terrible inmate conditions and corruption, and frankly I'm tired.",12

ADT cancelation,0,dq07ag,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dq07ag/adt_cancelation/,1,1572616278.0,"All right, for starts, this is the obligatory writing from my phone so please don't mind all the grammar errors and what not. 

TL;DR. I want to get out of my ADT contract but I don't know how. 

All right, so the story starts with having just bought a house in the new state that I'm working in. I was all very terribly excited about the whole deal and when the ADT spokes person came by my house, I thought nothing of it and almost immediately for heartedly jumped on the contract. looking back, I don't know if they were just that good of a salesperson or what, either way, now I'm locked into a three year contract at $60 a month that I can no longer really afford. I've tried to call ADT, and they don't seem to be much of any help with lowering pricings. In my contract it also says that if I cancel prior to my 3 years being up, I need to pay $75% of what I still owe. Needless to say I also cannot afford that. 
I'm at a point of pulling my hair out that let me to read through the fine print of the contract that they have with most customers. And I found one thing that looks like it could be a way out but it's also pretty sleazy and underhanded. 
There's a line in the contract that reads "" the customer breaks the monitoring panel, and ADT recommends it be replaced in the customer doesn't want to, ADT can cancel the contract at any time. "" 
it also says below that if this happens they will not assess payment for the rest of the contract. 
So would I read this as, is if I break the paneling one and I don't want to get a new one, they canceled my contract and I'm free and clear. I feel terrible about trying to find a way out of all this but I also feel like I was duped into a three year contract. I feel like it was my niavity that got me where I am but I find it incredibly frustrating that they won't budge on the matter. 
I need to get out of this contract. 
If anybody has had any dealings with ADT and can offer advice or recommendations I would greatly appreciate it. 
I know I'm going to get some of you guys giving me backlash about trying to get out of this because it was my own stupidity that got me into it, and I understand that. I apologize to all of the people better than me that wouldn't let themselves get into this situation. 
If anyone can help, I would so very much appreciate it.

My tolerance is very high, and with 5 hours between smoking and driving, I wasn’t high anymore. I was in the process of lighting a joint, i.e. it was not fully lit and I was not yet puffing on it, so I was not high when I was pulled over either.

"Landlord/Tenant Dispute - Retaliation, Verbal Agreements, etc. [Oregon]",1,dpzzcx,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dpzzcx/landlordtenant_dispute_retaliation_verbal/,0,1572614673.0,"I am a university student living in a college town in Oregon. I spent my summer on an international internship, and a plan to move in with a friend after returning failed. I had contacted another person before leaving, but they never returned a call to set up a visit to the house. I managed to contact this person from abroad, and signed the lease from there via adobe signable forms.

So I returned at the beginning of September, moved in, and everything seemed okay at first. The living situation is three students renting bedrooms in a house, but one of them is technically the landlord's agent as well. I will refer to him as ""**J**"". J is in a serious relationship with the landlord's daughter, who I will call ""**K**"". I will call the actual landlord ""**R""**. J began to show an erratic behavior pattern;  he consistently took the most extreme interpretation of anything I said.  I'm a very patient person, and he told me he had some mental health issues, but I didn't know how bad this would get.

At the end of the month, I had an unexpected money problem come up. I explained the money problem to him, and even though I had a way to fix it (i.e., pay rent), he told me that he'd allow me to pay a part of the rent that day and then pay the rest in a few days, when I got a paycheck. The money trouble made J nervous; my lease started with a three-month term, since J had done all of this with me sight-unseen from very far away.

The weekend after I was unable to pay rent, he told me he was willing to sign me on for another month; J said he would sign me on for a normal lease after that, but only if I was able to resolve my money troubles.  I was thankful for this reprieve, and waited for the check to process at my bank that weekend. We had agreed that I'd give him the remainder of what I owed as soon as the check processed, but J became antsy on Monday, and kept asking me if the check had come through.

J also ""doesn't believe in having a bank account"", which was my first clue that I'd made a mistake. Knowing this already, I began to explain to him how online banking works, but he kept escalating the conversation, and even though I did my best to get him to calm down, he ultimately shut down the conversation and slammed his bedroom door in my face. Half an hour later, he sent me **a text that amounted to a refusal to renew my lease beyond November**. He told me that I was being dishonest with him and I wasn't working hard enough to get the money to him.

Moving out in mid to late November would be extremely difficult to do here, because my classes are going be picking up steam by then, and it is more difficult to find places to live during this time in this city. His refusal is a violation of our earlier agreement, which unfortunately was verbal. This guy seemed mostly alright until he snapped that night, so I didn't worry about getting anything in writing. The only proof I have of those exchanges is a receipt from our agreement about the rent, and the newer lease (for the month of November).

All attempts to reason with him have failed (and continue to fail). I also talked to the other roommate about it when I ran into him on campus; he suggested asking K about it. I approached K as she was leaving one night, and told her about what happened; she told me that she didn't want to get involved, and after asking me a few questions, she left. 

J was upset about this; he accused me of harassing her. I told him that the other roommate suggested it, and confronted him about his irrational behavior. I told him that if he didn't relent and return to the original agreement, I may have to explore legal action for the sake of defending myself.

Next, I tried talking to the actual landlord, R. R seemed like a very reasonable person, claiming to understand how J's behavior was difficult to tolerate at times. I explained that it would be very challenging for me to move out according to J's demands, but if I could stay there until July, it would be easier since school would be over. He was receptive to this, and I hoped that he'd override J's decision. J had also never contacted my previous landlord, so I gave R the contact info.

Unfortunately, J told exaggerated versions of my mention of legal action and my conversation with the other roommate to R. Additionally, the landlord contact info I gave to R was for my landlord from 2017-2018, not 2018-2019; this was done on purpose, because my 2018-2019 landlord tried to break the law twice while I lived there, and I had to take legal action against them to make it stop. I explained this to J when I was talking to him on the phone from Borneo, and he agreed to accept the contact info from that landlord instead. I also emailed the 2017-2018 landlord before giving the contact info, and explained everything to him (the 2017-2018 landlord). He agreed to give me a reference.

J explained ***NONE OF THIS*** to R, at any point. The result is that R called the 2017-2018 landlord, found out that it's not my most recent landlord, and because he didn't have the information that I told J, it looked like I was being dishonest. That plus J's version of my interactions with him and the other roommate caused R to decide to allow me to move out early, but not extend the lease.

This is proving to be quite a problem; I'm taking some really challenging courses right now, and going through the motions of moving again could be a disaster for my grades. I've done it anyway, but I haven't found much; this is a college town with housing shortages due to the sheer number of students. I want to try talking to R one more time about this, but it's likely that he won't listen; he's in his early seventies, and it really seems as though he is more interested in not rocking the boat.

Does anyone in r/legaladvice have any ideas? J sent me the text message that started all of this immediately after I accused him of being unreasonable, and that seems retaliatory to me, but the last time I checked on that definition, I read that it was notoriously difficult to handle that in court.

But, I'm trapped here, these people are barely following the rules for a tenancy (there are details I've left out), and I need help. I would be much better off if I could just stay here until things are calmer and it's easier to find a new place.",1

He (23, M) is located in Zuni, VA. He’s had issues with the law before (I can’t quite remember to what extent, but iirc, I believe he’s done time at least once) and used to use heroin, and has probably relapsed since the breakup.

I (23, F) am located in Virginia Beach, VA and regret my life choices 

ITEMS LEFT: pair of handcuffs, cake carrier and spatula, leather choker which he gave me as a gift (tbh id normally be okay not getting gifts back, but it’s /super/ cute and goes well with a lot of stuff I’ve got), a ring, and possibly some articles of clothing 

     

DETAILS: My boyfriend and I recently (~3-4 weeks ago) broke up. I had left some of my things at his house a few days before, as I was under the assumption that I’d be there again soon. Since the breakup, there’ve been some very choice words hurled my way by him and frankly, if I never see him again it will be far too soon.

I don’t drive (no license and no car) and since he lives almost an hour away, getting a Lyft/Uber would be way too expensive. Since he has a truck and drives relatively nearby every day to get his methadone from the clinic, I told him when we broke up that I’d appreciate him dropping my things off as soon as it would be convenient, but since it’s been weeks and I still don’t have my things back, I feel like I need to do more than make a polite request. Additionally, I wouldn’t be comfortable just showing up at his place because I know that he has a gun (which I recall him mentioning that he needed to get his permit renewed for) and a temper to go along with it.

On a related note, he’d also been holding some things for a friend while said friend was out of state and has been refusing to work out a way to return them (my friend doesn’t have a car) and negotiations have deteriorated into nothingness following my ex sending me some incredibly awful messages, largely because we’re all tired of his shit and don’t want to speak to him ever again.

The morning of my first paycheck, I was pulled over and issued a speeding ticket by highway patrol. I obviously didn’t have proof of insurance to show the officer, who said it was fine and that I could submit proof along with my ticket payment online. As soon as I got to work afterward and checked that my paycheck had been deposited, I paid for a 6-month liability only policy and was issued a temp card the same day. I then go to check the ticket number so I could pay it off online, and realize that the officer marked “Yes” in the section that asked if the driver showed proof of insurance. So when I paid the ticket, I did not submit proof of insurance, as the county website said I didn’t need to if the officer marked “Yes” on that section of the ticket.

Yesterday, I received a notice from the Ohio BMV asking me to send them/bring them proof of insurance, as I did not provide it when I received the ticket (which I did not, although the officer wrote that I had...). Will the policy I bought the same day I received the ticket count? Or will I have my license suspended because I purchased the policy about an hour later, after I received my paycheck and could afford it? I’m terrified that I won’t be able to drive, and as a result won’t be able to continue working. I have zero support from my family as they are also struggling, so this would cripple me financially.",3

Pavement markings designates them as a left turn only lane, a left turn/straight lane, and a right turn only lane.

He will scream out tasks at me like find flights to here on this day nothing before 9AM, I will bring him a list of the flights and he will ask what about something at 8AM just to fluster me. He can see me start to become anxious and he will keep going asking me questions like “if I’m stupid” “if I am slow” basically doing this on purpose for his amusement and to bully. He does this to everyone in the office and I have substantial proof of the harassment he will even throw objects in his office. I fear him so much because of the way he speaks to me and everyone else that it triggers a full blown anxiety attack where I can’t breathe.

"what are my options to remove a friend from the house, who is staying with us long overdue (New Jersey)",24,dplw1d,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dplw1d/what_are_my_options_to_remove_a_friend_from_the/,32,1572548466.0,"Forgive my horrible grammar and punctuation, it is not my forte.It pains me to even consider this at this moment but today is the last day i am willing to accept his share of the rent. let me start at the beginning.

roughly 14 months ago i invited my friend to have a place to stay, i said "" come up here, spend 4 months on vacation rent free, to get over your ex and get your life in order and whatnot"" and sure enough i even chipped in with others to get him away from the situation he was in.

4 months come and go and i start idly chiding him about getting a job and he brushes it off as he doesn't want to work - for example at mc-donalds or wendys, as hes over 30 and has interest taking commissions and possibly being a Paid DM on roll20.

Me and my wife Humor him, go bud get those dreams.

3 months ago we remind him its been 11 months since he moved in, he had 4 months for free, and has technically been living here for 7 months without paying his share of the rent and bills, eating our food and generally being a layabout.

this of course BLINDSIDED him, he said - in his words - "" you told me i can stay here rent free since its all paid for anyway  its not like i cost you anything to keep""

this is true - i probably spend roughly 30$ on food for him and share in the family meals (which means me and my wife eat less) and other than that he just eats bandwith, a little laundry money and a few other things - maybe a movie every other month or something.

the point my wife's parents help fund us and are quite livid in the idea of supporting him without him doing any work, and put the ultimatum out there that he needs to get a job and pay rent or hes out. they gave him TWO months to find work and get paid.

two months pass and with no effort on his part i convinced a neighbor who was starting his own construction business to take him on as a hired hand, Unfortunately he was already behind (and starting chemotherapy) in bills and could only work him for 2 days before having to go back to his old job. Because the contract he was working on refused payment.

we convinced the powers that be to give him one extra month, hoping my neighbors job pans out - as the Neighbor explained to us that he got a new contract with a new company and said he would know if he can hire my friend in a couple of days. (which was oct 1st)

Neighbor informed us that the company wants the work done. but his boss wont release the funds he needs to do the job. so hes back to square one again now i inform my friend - that he is not going to be working for my neighbor and needs to get his own method of work because we have graciously extended his 60 days to 90 days (ignoring the 7 months prior because we're i dunno gullible nice people)

TL:DR

i think he secretly thinks we cant evict him because its getting to the winter months and hes safe till spring since its new jersey.

Facts: He has never paid a single dime in rentHe is not on the lease - i amhe has proof of ""paying me"" some money, but i have receipts for the vapejuice he must have to survivethis money \^ he got by begging his mom.He claims to be working for a game company that is putting their game on hold while they are in schoolHe has been working on his twitch to stream the game he is playing - but when asked why he isn't streaming he said "" the game i want to stream isn't released yet (hint it releases right before December) and wont even attempt to stream anything else.

all of his stuff is in my room in boxes that haven't been unpacked since he got here minus his computer he plays on daily

he claims to be autistic and incapable of work, and spent the last week trying to figure out how to file for SSI to pay his share of rent (he got as far as providing proof of residence, which he does not have) and gave up on the first page of documentation.

i am relatively sure he did not work the year prior to helping him move due to the fact he did not give one shit about his tax refund, and why his ex refuses to talk to me about it (like i'm going to send him back or something?)

my father in law simply said throw him out and change the locks on the door, hire some people (from the neighbor who also offered me free locks) to move his shit to the curb. - i'd rather not but it is the wakeup call he fucking needs i'm starting to think.

Edit/update: im extremely patient, my wife is too. i am also too nice and basically a big teddybear. i am aware of being taken advantage of, and if he doesn't do what he says hes gonna do. He is going to be served with a sudden ejectment action which is going to include all his stuff, since that'd be impossible to write in my good nature of holding it till he is able to pick it up.

we are attempting all avenues of keeping this as civil as possible.

Not going to change the locks till he leaves.i was going to talk to him about it tomorrow but he apparently had to hash it out with my wife in the middle of the weekly D&D session.

He is going to speak to his parents about getting a loan, OR a train ticket in the morning OR getting amtrak to let his Christmas ticket, which he already has, be used early.

i have already agreed to holding his stuff, not as ransom but as a friend, until he can manage to get on his feet and get his own u-haul, or pay his way back into the house - and after 3 or 4 months we'll talk about what he wants to do with the 12 boxes which are taking up approximately 24 cubic feet of space (half a wall in a room) - too much to take on a single train ride or pack in a normal car.

his car is broken down and technically abandoned sitting in a private lot for 14 months, not sure what he expects to do with that, i didn't mention it before but that's how he got up here, with a u-haul trailer. it broke down at the last 5% of the trip (gushed oil everywhere under the car)  


Final edit: he paid up, and agreed if he cannot manage to make next months rent that he agreed he will leave in the most civil manner possible.

Housing Inspection performed by local Voucher Authority concludes my apartment has a cat odor and therefore fails inspection odor will not come out no matter what [INDIANA],10,dpoy20,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dpoy20/housing_inspection_performed_by_local_voucher/,20,1572563692.0,"I have lived here since 2016 on a housing voucher and I've always had cats. There has always been a 'cat smell' in the apartment due to this. I try to keep up on it. I carpet clean frequently and have purchased my own personal carpet cleaner. However, I think the cats have just been naughty and have eliminated on the carpet from time to time. I cannot get the smell to come out no matter what I do.  


The Housing Authority who provides my voucher did an inspection and declared that I failed due to an odor in the unit. I am unable to get the smell out and they demand that it be fixed so I am left puzzled by what I can do to remedy the situation. I have two children who receive disability and require extensive constant care so I am unable to work and those two checks are all of the money I have available. Everywhere I look online always says it costs several hundred more than the entire sum of both checks we receive for an entire month to fix this issue.  


The Housing Authority demands another inspection on Thursday, in which I will definitely fail again. On a side note, this building has massive issues including mold growing in the ceiling in common areas that tenants are forced to walk through. However, nothing is ever done about this and the Housing Authority who has always preached to have our backs on maintenance issues does nothing. I have mentioned it to them countless times. Now my unit is an issue meanwhile the building is in that condition overall?  


My sons with disability likely contribute to the issue as well because of their strange habits they have spilled milk in the carpet in one room and I have cleaned and cleaned but that has left a slight odor there, too.

Florida Medicare Advantage plan bill issues/misinformation,1,dpyvi5,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dpyvi5/florida_medicare_advantage_plan_bill/,0,1572607822.0,"Florida Being billed for a service that based on how the bill is written appears to costs $3000, and my insurance (BCBS Medicare Advantage plan) is supposed to pick up 80%. Insurance is claiming it cost $13,225 and the 20% I owe is $2645. All three entities (BCBS, Carecentrix \[DME biller supplier-still unclear what they do, besides fuck up\] and the provider of the actual service) involved claim they are not responsible for the bill, and they all have different numbers for who has been paid what amount. I have done all I can think of to dispute the bill, and am being told the item cannot be returned. At a loss.

.I have a Medicare Advantage plan with BCBS and got a pair of custom made orthotic braces this March. My plan has $0 out of pocket for deductible, $0 co-pay for this particular device. My plan covers some things with a copay of X, somethings I owe a percentage. When percentage is done, it's usually 20% and they call it co-insurance.

The orthotic maker and I both discussed coverage with BCBS and came to the conclusion that there is no copay/deductible. Maybe I made a mental error and forgot the 20% coinsurance existed. Assumed they were covered 100%

The bill I received 3 weeks after the braces were delivered came from a group called Carecentrix who I have never dealt with and showed 3 claims totaling $13,226, insurance paid $314 and there were $10,220 worth of ""adjustments"" and I was billed $2,645.

Every month I receive a paper showing the months claims what I owe and it says ""this is not a bill"" your provider will bill you for anything you owe. The orthotics company never sent me a bill. Carecentrix claims they billed me what the provider (orthotics company billed them).

I started calling BCBS and Carecentrix. The orthotics maker said they were paid over $11,000 but are contractually limited from telling me what BCBS paid them for their services. I asked for an EOB to be mailed 5 times in the last 5 months with the most recent being Sept 30. I was told it would arrive in 7-10 business days which would put it about a week ahead of my ALJ hearing (scheduled for 10/24)  received it today 31 days after I spoke with somebody and asked for it for the 5th time. The  envelope is stamped 10/28 (it's 10/31 currently)

I've already disputed this to the point of having an ALJ hearing- I lost despite them having copies of the bills I've received. Saying BCBS followed the EOB- even though the ALJ didnt have a copy of the EOB.  I cant think of anything else to do. I've been able to wear the braces for about 2 weeks since March. I've had over a dozen appointments with the brace maker, spent closes to $500 on PT, seen a podiatrist in and attempt to get everything set up correctly. Een gotten a CT scan to measure a leg length discrepancy that the brace builder said was  0.375 inch.... it's 0.003 inches. Today is the first day the braces have felt OK in 7.5 months.

Am I just shit out of luck and stuck paying $2600+ when based on the evidence I have, they should cost about $600 out of pocket?",1

Sister’s rich husband threatened to sue for custody of my daughter,485,dpa3m0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dpa3m0/sisters_rich_husband_threatened_to_sue_for/,50,1572486519.0,"Backstory: I (26F) sent my son (8M) to live with my sister (36F) and her husband (46M) in another state because I was trying to finish school and get a better job to better care for him. He lived over there with them for about a year. At first it was great – they took good care of him and I had the time to advance my standing in life and general ability to provide for my son. Then, they got too attached to my son. They told him to call them Mom & Dad, and often referred to me by my first name around him. This confused my son and was extremely disrespectful to me, so I decided to take him back before the agreed upon January 2020 date. When I discussed bringing him back, my sister was evasive and tried to keep pushing the date back. She also put in effort to try to convince my son that he would be unhappy if he came back to me.  She really tried to sabotage my relationship with my son. Anyway, I got an opportunity last month in which they invited me over to watch my son while they went away for the weekend. In the weeks leading up to this, I worked hard to find a place for us to live on our own, got him into the best school in the area, and got him into a great after school program. When that weekend came, I brought my son back to live with me and notified my sister and husband only after the fact. They were furious as I expected, but now the husband has threatened (via text) to sue for custody after saying what I did was illegal.

His threat included claims that custody cases are always more than $60k and he said he can afford it and I cannot. He said he will call CPS, the police, and a lawyer unless I apologize profusely to both of them and guarantee certain amounts of time for them to watch my son. He is very rich and I am not, so I think he is just trying to bully me into doing what he wants.

Some other details: They are not legally married, which I think would help my case. They just tell people they are married. Also, we signed a guardianship agreement in the state of Georgia. This grants my sister guardian status until January 2020, but does not forfeit my parental rights. Also my son is thriving now and happy.

How scared should I be of his threat?",485

My husband and I have been in the process of selling our home for a while. The closing date was October 24 but the buyer needed more time to get some documents together. Today the purchaser decided he’d rather back out of the deal than provide the documentation. 

There was a small amount of earnest money that we expect to get but we’ve spent considerably more than that on rent at a new residence, a storage unit, a moving van, etc. We’ve also canceled all services, which means deposits when we have to re-enroll and we sold some things cheaply that we’ll need to repurchase for more (like our lawn mower). Do we have any legal recourse to hold this person more accountable?

The insurance company only covered stolen jet ski's in a locked secure enclosure (gated fence, garage, etc). After Hurricane Irma (October of 2017), it knocked down my gate in my house. We didn't have any money to buy a whole new fence. So we temporarily installed a cemented anchor into the ground and put a padlock and a huge chain on it, until we can afford a new fence.

The padlock was broken and then the jet-ski was stolen. Police report was made, pictures were taken, and insurance contacted. They briefly sent a letter saying they denied my request to make a claim for the jet-ski. Reason: not in secure enclosure with proof of break in. Now I'm stuck paying the jetski off for the amount $13k with no help from the insurance company or lien holder.

I have been told to speak to an attorney for help, but no one that I've reached out to, actually does this kind of help.

I now received a lawsuit from the lien holder on the jetski that was stolen. I do owe the money, I've just been looking for help before I pay this without paying for an actual jetski I don't have.

Repair and Deduct laws,0,dpykle,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dpykle/repair_and_deduct_laws/,3,1572606118.0,"So I would like to apply repair and deduct as stated in DC Municipal Terms to a set of locks I had to have replaced at the cost of $673. Very expensive I know.

I was a victim of an armed robbery outside my building. One of the things they absconded with were the keys to my apartment, which I share with two other roommates. We all have separate leases with the landlord. I called twice that night, but both times no-one picked up and it went to voicemail. After this, I emailed both the landlord’s personal and company email. My roommate texted him. I stayed up all night and called the locksmith in the morning.

It turns out that he responded to my roommate’s text, but he never contacted me.  His plan was to show up sometime in the afternoon. Of course I did not know this. Tired, scared ( because they saw me enter the apartment and had my keys), guilty (for endangering my roommates), really wanting to get far away, and knowing that he was a shitty landlord already, I didn’t try very hard to rely on him and I just got the locks replaced.

I thing repair and deduct applies because it was an emergency involving building safety and I attempted to notify him. However, usually a full 24 hour period is allowed for repairs. 

There are other things - lead paint that he did not remove properly and did not wait for us to provide signed notices for; he never signed and returned my lease; persistent house issues such as a leak, bugs, etc.

Live-in landlord redoing the roof- what are my options?,2,dpvp77,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dpvp77/livein_landlord_redoing_the_roof_what_are_my/,0,1572592185.0,"In AZ, no lease

&#x200B;

GF, a dog, and I rent a 2nd floor loft-space from a friend.  Back in mid-sept he, the homeowner and landlord, began redoing the 1st floor (his) roof- new rafter beams, plywood, shingles, insulation- the works.  He only does about 3-4hrs of work a day and should finally be finishing things up sometime next week.  Then he's going to begin doing the 2nd floor (my roof) but at the rate he works he'll be at it for a month or more. Being without a roof for that long I can imagine is really going to run up the heating bill and just be all-around incredibly inconvenient.  

&#x200B;

The questions I have: Are we stuck paying hotel bills and rent if we don't want to stay here through the renovation? Is he required to pay/contribute to alternate housing in any way (how much)?  If so, to what degree of comfortably are we  entitled- we never eat out, so a kitchenette is required, we have a large-breed dog (shepherd) that we have to consider as well.  Can he force us into a place that doesn't allow dogs or put us up in a one-bed roadside-motel dump where we're forced to eat out everynight?  Also, what defines a roof?  In other words, is there some half-assed point of completion he could say ""it's good to live there now?"", and not legally be in the wrong, even though the work isn't 100% complete?

&#x200B;

As an aside, what's his liability in regard to refuse & debris?  All the old wood, shingles and associated fasteners, clips, and nails are haphazardly strewn across our backyard.  I've had a few nails puncture the soles of my shoes already, but fortunately nothing has broken the skin and as far as I can tell the dog has been mostly ok (three scrapes across her leg where she's caught the corner of scrap wood), but she's tough and it doesn't seem to bother her. But just in case something does happen, I'd like to be prepared.

This sounds like it would be right, but I cannot find an actual place on the DMV website or anything that specifically states this is the case.

Does anybody have any experience with this? Has anybody ever heard of anyone being sued for smog repairs when they sold a car that couldn't pass smog but sold it on a PNO status?

Also, another question: When you place a car on PNO, can I just sell it immediately or do you get a new title indicating it's PNO? Because my plan was to leave it registered so somebody can test drive and then sell it to them after placing it on PNO

For the record, I am not at all considering selling it registered as is since I'm completely aware that is not legal, but having trouble finding if there is a liability issue with a PNO car.

I'm a trans person. I have one name that I use publically, and my legal one. I got a new job recently at a corporate retail place. The kind where accounting and HR are in different states.

I mentioned I had a different name after I was hired and asked if my checks would be made out to what I put in my I9 and w2. I was told ""probably.""

Cut to payday. Check doesn't have my legal name, it's useless paper according to my bank. I ask for a reissue. Get initially told yes but the next day I'm told I have to change my name in the system. 

Okay, fine. I'll do that, get my check, switch back. I'd set up direct deposit, I have two weeks before next payday, should be cool. I fill out their form.

Get told the day after that if I change my name, I can't swap back for a year. WTF.jpg?! I say this is unacceptable. I don't want my legal name going on everyone's receipts, on the schedule and anywhere with a computer. 

I ask for them to just add the sum of the check they refuse to reissue to my first direct deposit. I get told that  corporate doesn't do that.

Call it a manageable gambling addiction. I would still like to have something I can make gambles on with penny ante stakes, what other options do I have available to me?

I do have an IRA based plan, but I don't gamble with that one. I know that's safe from 3210 closure.

He’s called, tried to text me (blocked his number), on my birthday he sent me a long email with a link to a gift and asking me to talk to him. Tried to follow me on social media even though I blocked him. Makes fake accounts until I block those too. I have never responded to him. This has been going on for a year now after I asked him to give me space. 

All pretty harmless, but for the last month I’ve been getting these prank calls that I couldn’t figure out how to block because they would come from different numbers. I found out he was putting my number in a prank site that records the call - multiple times a day, for a month straight. 

I’ve just ignored it because he lives so far away, but I’m afraid he’s going to come to my city eventually and try to find me at my job. He looks at my LinkedIn every week - I get the notification so I know he knows where I work. He just won’t leave me alone and it’s been a year now.

Which is understandable under normal circumstances, but here are the issues.
1. She did not want the bottom half of the house done but he did it anyways.

2. She has paid a small amount plus went with him and bought the supplies with her money 

3. He hasn't paid rent in over a year (he was on hard times and she understood he would pay her once he got steady work)

4. He had surgery recently, and during the recovery time, she was his care giver (getting medication, taking him to appointments, and talking to the doctors for him.)

Now he has threatened to take it to small claims and I was wondering what footing we have against him, since a year if rent is almost 2 grand he hasn't paid, and caregivers are expensive too, plus half the work done was unwanted at the time.

FL Title XL - Scummy backhand dealings with to steal from deceased people's stocks,0,dpxvu0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dpxvu0/fl_title_xl_scummy_backhand_dealings_with_to/,1,1572602563.0,"My Mother I have been approached by a third party company that wants to ""help"" me get unclaimed property that we inherited through my grandfather. Their initial agreement stipulated that before they reveal what the property is we must sign an agreement that we will relinquish 25% of the whatever they are able to ""help"" us connect with as finder's fee.

After checking [fltreasurehunt.gov](https://fltreasurehunt.gov) I was unable to find any publicly listed unclaimed assets. Thinking this company \_\_\_\_\_ d/b/a \_\_\_\_\_ had a simple clerical error from some of this old assets we already claimed, we signed the initial agreement.

As it turns out, my grandfather owned stocks in a large FL electronics FIRM, a company he worked at for four decades. After his passing over 2 1/2 years ago they have made no attempt to let us know that there was tens of thousands of dollars just sitting waiting for us to claim it or after 5 years be escheated to the state. The ONLY reason we have found out about this is because of \_\_\_\_\_.

Therein lies my questions:

After I contacted the company that handles finances for the firm, called X here, they confirmed the account number was a valid account but they could not reveal one iota of account info without being declared administrator of his estate within the last 60 days. How then was \_\_\_\_\_ able to send me documents with my grandfather's social, FIRM account number, and things we aren't allowed to ask? The lady from X says that they work with \_\_\_\_\_ sometimes to get people their money faster...

The lady had the audacity to say that we were asking about it ""very early"" and we ""were ahead of the ball"" but couldn't articulate how Honeywell goes about notifying next of kin before they forfeit their unbeknownst inheritance. What I know to be the case is that Honeywell, through X, is giving this information to their corporate friends so that they can, through entirely legal methods, steal 25% of my grandfather's earned stocks.

&#x200B;

My legal questions:

There is only one section of the agreement that seems to have legal bearing I'm concerned about:

\>This is a contingent fee agreement based upon recovery of the account(s) and that in the event of the failure of \_\_\_\_\_ to recover such account(s), the agreement shall be deemed null and void. However, if the undersigned recovers the account(s) after \_\_\_\_\_ discloses the same thereby circumventing \_\_\_\_\_, the undersigned agrees to pay \_\_\_\_\_'s fee as if they had used \_\_\_\_\_ in accordance with this agreement.

What legal repercussions would be available to \_\_\_\_\_ or their holding company should we take the stocks directly from FIRM rather than use \_\_\_\_\_'s service?

Since there are legal documents required to claim his stocks, even to discuss the stocks with FIRM. Was FIRM in violation of anything by revealing this information to a third party company?

Was FIRM in breach of anything by not listing his unclaimed property on public records more than two years after my grandfather's death but revealing it to private interests?

Is \_\_\_\_\_ in any violation of statutes of limitations for percentage taken as ""finder's fee""? Currently, they are asking 25% which apparently has got them in trouble with other state's. ",0

 I'm a college student in Orange County, California. I have to pay quite a bit in rent so I work for a Persian restaurant nearby my college. I used to work for them last year from about Sept 2018 to Jan 2019, then I took a break to focus on my studies, and now I'm back because I'm really desperate. They steal our overtime pay, and our holiday pay, and I found this out only after working holidays and overtime last year, and when I noticed there wasn't any overtime pay on my paychecks, a coworker told me they don't pay that for anyone- but I was desperate and thought ""I'm only a server, what does it matter. I'm not important"" -which I know was a terrible way to think. So this time, returning to the restaurant I told myself I wouldn't work overtime or holidays. However, I've been counting my hours, and found that they're stealing those too.

 I want to unionize, as do some of my other coworkers, but some of my coworkers are undocumented and I don't want to risk their safety in anyway. I can't afford a lawyer, but even if I could, my boss is super rich and probably has an entire legal team.

A massive storm front and windstorm came in this afternoon, there were several roads out of commission very quickly due to flooding and trick or treating had be cancelled and moved to Saturday. The other fun thing was that after we had just gotten home there was a loud bang that we heard outside, we ran out to check to see what it was when one of our girls noted that the trampoline was gone. 

Now its not the largest trampoline, probably weighs only about 75 pounds and isnt nearly the full length one, but the wind had picked it up and slammed it, bottom first, into our neighbor's siding. Not our really nice neighbor either, the one we have had issues with before for them not being happy that we use mulch on the retaining wall between our houses and have yelled at my wife and two little girls though will nary say word contradictory to me. 

I went over to retrieve the trampoline and my neighbor Bob was outside looking at it as well. I had my wife stay behind because of how adversarial they like to treat her. I pulled the trampoline, which had lodged itself into the siding, out. He and I did a quick seal the 3 holes created to keep water out during the storm and I took pictures of the damage. Of the 3 spots, they were escalating in damage, 1 was a small crack in the siding, 1 was a more of a punctured spot, and the 3rd went straight through and look like it took out some of the fiberglass behind it as well. The conversation remained cordial, borderline friendly, but again, they dont tend to ever raise their voice or act up when I am around. 

Just trying to figure out what steps will need to be taken further, do I file a claim to their damage since it was my property, do I wait for them to file? What kind of liability am I looking at since it was a trampoline, I've heard those are insurance black holes, and do they have the ability to make this worse than repairing the three holes in the siding?

Location: Ohio

A couple of months ago I was run off the road by a commercial truck. Turns out that the guy was borrowing the truck and didn’t have a drivers license or insurance. The truck itself WAS insured by its owner.

Police report states I am not at fault whatsoever.

My car is older so I didn’t carry full collision insurance - my insurance company isn’t helping. I filed a claim with the insurer of the truck but nothing substantial has come of that so far. 

That leads to my secondary question:

I was tempted to find a lawyer to pursue it more actively, but no one was injured and there is probably a small amount of $$ involved so I’ve gotten the impression that most lawyers wouldn’t take the case?

Today I got a call from “the prosecutor of the town of XYZ”. Apparently they are pursuing the guy who hit me and the prosecutor wants to talk to me. I didn’t even know they had a prosecutor LOL.

My big question:

It seems like it would be unwise to speak to this guy on my own? Is it time to find myself a lawyer? If so what kind of lawyer do I look for? I’ve gotten dozens of letters from “ambulance chasers”  but I’m not sure if that would be the way to go.",2

Mom's husband wants me to transfer his side income into my bank account for tax purposes,2,dpuafe,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dpuafe/moms_husband_wants_me_to_transfer_his_side_income/,5,1572586171.0,"Just made an account to ask this. I live in Florida. I'm a full-time student in my early 20's, I don't have a job and I live under my mom's roof. My mom's husband wants to sell some old, potentially valuable model cars he just bought for cheap on Ebay for a small profit, maybe $200 if I had to guess.

He wants me to give him my routing number and account number so he can input them on Ebay and have the money go to my account. This way he can avoid taxes as I have no income. Is this tax avoidance or tax evasion? If it's problematic, is there a better way to go about it or to convince him it's a bad idea? What would the consequences be if it's legally shaky?

We got my dog Fred, in 2012 I think and he has grown up loving everyone in the household a lot. Since the splitting up of my parents, my mum has only seen Fred a handful of times and my dad refuses to let my mum see Fred. However, when my parents were going through mediation, they agreed they’d split the responsibilities of looking after Fred each week. So 1 week at my mums then 1 week with my dad. This was the final agreement and is it writing and signed by both my mum and dad. However, my dad never once has let my mum see Fred intentionally without me being sneaky. He said he will only let her see Fred if she pays £20 per month since the break up as he pays all his insurance fees. I don’t want my dad in trouble but I want my mum to see my dog.

Ex Fiancé and His Mother Attempting to Blackmail Me for the Return of My Belongings,3,dpsdqr,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dpsdqr/ex_fiancé_and_his_mother_attempting_to_blackmail/,1,1572578217.0,"Hey everyone, I'm hoping someone can help me navigate this stressful mess of a situation I'm in.

A few months back I was visiting my parents in the UK (where I'm originally from) but was living with my fiancé in the Netherlands. I ended up breaking off the relationship in August due to issues we were having, but at the time had no money to return to the Netherlands and so it was agreed that my now ex partner would pack my things and I would arrange the collection of them.

However he became extremely uncooperative and threatened to let debt collectors (for debt entirely his own, not mine) take my stuff, and threatened to throw my things out. I tried time and time again to compromise and begged him to just send over my desktop PC and a suitcase of my warm clothes for now if he didn't have time to pack the entirety of my things.

He eventually ended up blocking me on all platforms, so I could no longer contact him to discuss my belongings. I then had to contact his mother (who he lives with in the same property I was also living in) and asked her if she wouldn't mind doing it. She was cooperative at first, but after nearly 3 weeks of her ignoring my requests for updates, she too blocked me. 

They are now contacting my mother and attempting to blackmail me for the return of my own things in exchange for 2 pairs of head/earphones, a laptop, and 2 credit/debit cards. I have made it clear the entire time that I will happily return the things that belong to him, but those things are only headphones and the cards. The earphones and laptop were gifted to me by him, for me to keep indefinitely, free of charge. And I have screenshots that prove this.

My question now is what rights do I have I have in situation? As they are withholding my belongings and demanding some of my own in return. Any advice what I can do? They have in their possession literally thousands of pounds worth of my stuff, the most expensive items I have receipts for. I'm desperate.",3
What kind of lawyer can I hire to help me return my deposit from the management company?,3,dpsbrg,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dpsbrg/what_kind_of_lawyer_can_i_hire_to_help_me_return/,5,1572577987.0,"Hi everyone, I hope you can help me here

We got a year lease that was early terminated for an emergency. The deposit was $1000.

The management gave us the option to sublease the apartment instead of the early termination fee. Another resident took over. But we are charged with $1117, more than the deposit for early termination, damage fee, utility,  carpet/ unit cleaning fee.

Since the situation of the apartment at the time of rental was terrible, we didn't expect them to have us clean it for them. We did send them pictures of the terrible condition 10 days in. Now they added the early termination fee.

We sent them a certified mail, politely asking to return the deposit and rectify the situation. Intitally, they said they're pending on the landlord response, but no response for almost a month now. They don't take our calls (transfer to manager and give us voice mail) and we don't know what to do at this stage except escalating to the civil court.

I thought of seeking your opinion to direct us to get a professional help on this case. Thank you!",3
"Discovered a Leak on Property After Receiving a High Water Bill, Immediately Reported It to Landlord but He Has Made No Effort to Repair It, What Are Our Possible Options",7,dpp3ha,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dpp3ha/discovered_a_leak_on_property_after_receiving_a/,2,1572564352.0,"This is in Florida.

So getting close to a month ago, we received our water bill that was more than double what our water bill normally is. As soon as I got the bill, I called the water department and they walked me through how to check the meter to determine whether or not we have a water leak. I took pictures of the water meter before and after 2 hours without using any form of water. Supposedly the dial moving indicates that there is a water leak. As soon as I saw that, I texted our landlord the pictures and informed him that there was a water leak. He proceeded to ask a bunch of questions about whether or not we left any of the faucets running or if a toilet was continuously running (there is nothing, no dripping faucets or hoses and no continuously running toilets). He said alright he would send somebody to take a look at it after the weekend. Nothing happened. Now before I take any more steps, I want to know what our options are.

Some background, we have already had several problems with him. We have had problems with the A/C and heating since day 1. It was obviously an old unit that he just kept on trying to repair (he works with A/Cs). Almost 2 weeks ago, the A/C went out and we informed him of it. To make a long story short, we went through 4 different ""techs"" (I put quotation marks because one of the gentlemen that showed up was obviously not working in the capacity of a company, was on the phone with the landlord the entire time, ended up frying both the inside and outside units, and left the outside unit open with exposed wires), after which the landlord said that he would come down himself and fix it. Turns out he decided to replace the A/C unit himself (again, not working in the capacity of a company). The entire time he acted as though he was doing us a favor even though it took him 10 days to fix the issue because he was trying to be cheap (words of his father and brother both of whom he sent over to check out the situation). I am 8 months pregnant and according to our lease it states that he is responsible for the cooling and the plumbing.

Now, my question is this: if he does not make any effort to repair this water leak which will most likely only get worse, do we have the right to terminate our lease? We have no idea where the leak is as we do not see any water or water damage anywhere inside the home or outside the home. So it is not necessarily considered a problem that makes the dwelling uninhabitable. However, again, it will only get worse and we are responsible for utilities. Our lease is up at the end of January, but if we continue to have problems, we think it may be best for us to end it early as we were planning to move at the end of January anyways. I just want to know whether or not we have any rights to push this issue especially since he's already shown that he cannot be reasoned with and will try to take the cheapest option possible which is to not make the repair and just make us pay the utility bill.",7

How to exit a 1yr apartment rental contract with no exit clause? (WI),0,dpx426,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dpx426/how_to_exit_a_1yr_apartment_rental_contract_with/,4,1572598768.0,"Question: What is the best way for my girlfriend to exit her 1 year rental agreement that has no phrasing regarding terminating the contract early?


Context: My girlfriend lives in a single bedroom duplex in Amery WI, and she wants to move for a variety of reasons.  Namely, the apartment is pretty shabby, (old house, weird layout, cheap linoleum peeling up, holes in ceiling & walls, etc.), and the walls/floors are so thin she can hear her neighbors screaming and cursing at their young children every night. Not fun.  She took this place because northern WI has few housing opportunities for someone living alone because of the population density, and it was the only place open near her new job at the time.  Now that she has found a real apartment 25mins closer to work she wants to upgrade, but the agreement she signed apparently has nothing regarding early termination.


When informing her landlord today he was rather (understandably) pissed.  As far as I can see, this is because a renter is a good source of income for him, the apartment is shitty enough that only someone with few other options would take it, Amery is a 1-road kind of town in the middle of nowhere so there probably aren't a lot of prospective renters, and the apartment is only suitable for singles since it has 1 small bedroom.  Also apparently, he was picky about vetting her to make sure ""she wasn't a drug dealer or something."" (She is an engineer).  All of this means it probably takes him many months to find new tenants. 


There is apparently a section in the agreement allowing a sub-leaser, though the landlord has to personally approve them, and all of the above conditions mean that could take months.


The company for the new apartment wants a deposit ASAP, so I'm currently looking for both short term, and long term solutions to her problem.  I told her to look up a lawyer for advice tomorrow, but i'm also trying to hash out other options to help her out. 


Are there some commonly used ways to get out of this situation?  Like offering the deposit, and 2-3 months rent for being allowed to exit?   What could be considered ""reasonable"" to offer in this situation?  How should she approach this guy thats pissed about losing his steady source of reliable income?  (Top question is most important)

I am one of the only employees who work 4 days a week and they are trying to force me to work 5 days a week like the rest of the employees. 

We also do not get breaks in this time as I am the only employee in the store many of the days and there is no one to work sales if I take a break. We used to be able to put a note on the door saying “be back in 10 minutes,” but we aren’t allowed to do that anymore. 

The company was sued a few years ago so now on our paychecks they ask “did you take your breaks?” Which we are instructed to say no to. Then it pops up the question, do you waive your right to breaks, which we are forced to say yes too. Once I tried to buck the system and say no to this question and HR called me and told me I am not allowed to say no and must answer yes. 

The thing that is different is I am told I am an “exempt” employee, but I don’t know what that means. I work completely under commission and have no salary. 

Is this legal? I don’t understand how it is legal for them to force us into working 55 hours/week. 

TL:DR My company forces us to work 11 hr days with no overtime, no breaks and over 40 hours a week, which they say is legal because we are strictly commission based employees.

The company I called had installed the product in my home and the manufacturer recommended that I contact the installer. When I made the appointment with the installer, I made clear that the manufacturer had told me to call the installer. 

The technician came to my home, inspected the installed products, changed remote batteries (that were provided by me), and handed me an iPad that had an invoice with notes on it. It basically said everything I just said about the inspection and batteries and had a line item for ""diagnosis"", but had no pricing information. He said that a copy will be sent from the office, but I could sign this iPad.

Because it had no pricing information, I asked the technician, ""You didn't have to repair anything? It seemed like you were fixing the upstairs unit."" He said ""Nope, I just had to change the batteries. Everything I inspected looked okay."" We talked about having them back out in the spring for a cleaning service and I tipped him $20 and he left.

A few days later, I received an emailed invoice for over $100 for a diagnostic charge and a minor repair charge. I called and asked why I was being charged when I signed an invoice with no price on it and had not been told at any point that there would be any charge. I had assumed it was a warranty issue because of the manufacturer's advice. The man on the phone apologized for not informing me there was a ""trip charge"" for every appointment when I scheduled. (Had I known this was not a warranty call and I would have had to pay anyway, I would have chosen our normal service company.)

I spoke with the general manager of the company who informed me that I would have to pay at least the diagnostic charges and he would ""waive"" the minor repair fee. I agreed to that. It was just not expected after I'd signed an invoice for $0. I also told him I would only agree to this if it was accompanied by an apology in writing. I figured this would help if I had to report them anywhere. I still have not received an apology.

Is it legal in Pennsylvania for them to bill me for ""minor repair charges"" that weren't on the signed invoice? Is it legal for them to not price items before requiring a customer to sign an invoice and for the customer to have no indication of the price? I understand this may be legal for them to do and I'm going to pay the invoice unless otherwise suggested, but this doesn't sit right with me and I would like to report them if possible to prevent anyone else from being in this position.

I have copies of both versions of the invoice if necessary. 

Thank you!",11

I live in a condo and there's ""columns"" of property. I live on the highest floor and it's only my property up there. A few years ago one of the condo tenants took the job as like the manager or associate kind of things where he is involved in repairs and snow shoveling and things like that. We pay monthly fees for the management of the entire condo. For the past year, he's been making unnecessary renovations around the complex. He starts the projects and then tells us afterward about it and raises the management fees. He uses the management fees on making his place look nicer so he can sell it instead of shoveling the snow from the driveways and basically things that are necessary. He even hires his own family to ""do"" the vacuuming, shoveling, and garbage even though in reality, they don't do anything.  He misuses the money and recently changed the security cameras that are pointing at the doors. However, he doesn't give us access to it. Now I can't check whether or not there are any dangers outside my doors and he won't let us install our own cameras. He also frequently complains about the two shoe cases we have outside our doors even though it doesn't block anyone. What can I do about this situation? It has made living here very difficult.

My Mom - currently in California, registered in a domestic partnership in California with a man who has unexpectedly passed away.

They recently bought a house in Texas and spent some time there. As far as i can tell it passes a Texan  three-prong test  for Common law marriage due to them buying the house as married couple. He has 3 adult kids who can contest as heirs.

Facing these issues:

1. What would be considered a residence country for this person? He has not lived anywhere with any regularity except in California and his work travel over last couple of years, but no property/ties there outside of my mom.
2. How to find out if there is a will? It says as a county office, but facing problem 1 - should all 3 counties be asked or 1 would know if its anywhere in US
3. Can she choose to use probate court in her area or does it have to be where the person would be considered domiciled?
4. Does the house they bought as a married couple (with the rule that if one dies it passes to other) count as part of an estate? Or is that automatically become hers?",1

Spectrum billing issues for months,1,dpw4sg,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dpw4sg/spectrum_billing_issues_for_months/,0,1572594104.0,"This is a long one so be ready, I'm just trying to thoroughly explain the situation. Originally this all started in mid August of this year when I moved houses and asked spectrum to move my services to a new location and had an appointment set up to do so. One day after I got home from running a few errands, I came home to a package from Spectrum including new hardware which confused me considering I had brought the hardware from my old house with me to use. I wasnt advised about this package and called customer service and was simply told to let the technician take the extra hardware. 

The appointment went fine, had my service up and runnng and everything seemed fine and the techinican took the extra hardware with him (more on this later.) Fast forward to my next billing cycle and I take a different approach and decide to pay with a different debit card than normal (I generally just use autopay), and went online using my phone and logged into my spectrum account and went to the billing on there and paid my balance. I got a call a few days later saying I was past due, ended up calling customer service to figure out what happened and this is where my problems started.

What ended up happening was that when I initially called spectrum to move my services to my new location, the technician assisting me opened a whole new account for the house I had just moved into and left the old location's account still open and apparently ""running."" What was actually supposed to happen was that it should've been put down as a transfer and since that didn't happen, when I went to pay the bill on my phone, the payment was made to the old location/account which wasn't supposed to actually exist still therefore leaving the account on the new house unpaid for. Wound up having to call spectrum to sort this out and was told the balance paid to the old account would be transferred to the proper accont and that the old account would be terminated to which I thought the issue would be simply resolved and left it alone after.

Got a call a while later about having extra hardware that I needed to return and was confused because I had already had the extra hardware taken care of with the technician having taken it with him. I explained this to the representative and she told me that there was no record of this but that she would make a ticket for this to be looked into and that the reason she had called concering the hardware was because she was saying there was still activity showing from the old location, which completely confused me considering I had taken my equipment with me and that no equipment remained at the old house. Tried to argue about this for a while to no avail and she told me that because of this the full balance of my previous payment that was made to the account that was now terminated wouldn't be completely transferred and that only a partial amount would be transferred. I didn't know what to do at this point so I said whatever and went on with my day.

Ended up getting a call a few days later from the same representative about the extra hardware and she noticed she had called the same person for the same issue and apologized for calling again (again more on this later.) Started to have service interruptions a while later and when I called they said it was because of the previous issue with the account balances and that it should all clear up soon. I was pretty annoyed at this point because I had already spent hours on the phone with multiple people trying to clear this up and still had issues so I let the representative know that I had previously been considering an upgrade to their 1 gig internet plan which came with a $199.99 dollar installation fee and told them that I didn't think it would be worth it considering the hassle that I had with the billing payment mix up.

He told me that if I still had the inclination to upgrade, the $199.99 installation fee would be waved so I agreed and was then transferred to billing. I let the billing representative know what had been the reason for my transfer and was told that it wouldn't be possible as this was simply something they couldn't waive. I then asked to speak to a superviser to which he replied,  ""You know that when I get a superviser here they're going to tell you the exact same thing I just told you. Do you still wanna talk to one?"" with an apparent tone of annoyance and agreed to still speak to a superviser. Superviser came up on the phone and I explained to her what I was told about the installation fee for the gig internet being waived as compensation for the troubles caused before. She then said that wasn't possible and I let her know that a previous representative had clearly told me this would be done and that it should've been on the recorded phone call as proof. 

She checks and then agrees and sets up a plan to have increments of $75 in credit applied over the course of a few days until the $199.99 fee was paid off. Had a technician come to my house and install the gig service and left it at that. I went on with my business for a few days before realizing my internet speeds weren't matching up to what is advertised as the gig plan so again I ended up calling customer support to resolve the issue and was told to return my current equipment that in my posession and swap it for different equipment at the nearest spectrum store near me. Came back home with different hardware and connected everything. Started getting the correct advertised speeds and again went on with my life. 

A couple weeks pass by and I wake up one morning to no service whatsoever, proceed to call spectrum for the millionth time and was told that because the balance on my account was never paid. I then begin to explain my situation again and was told that the only way I would be able to use my service again was to pay the balance. I tell them there's no reason for me to have to pay that past due balance because everything should have been taken care of with the previous payment being transferred to the proper account, and the representative says that the ticket for this incident hadn't been approved and processed by the billing department. I agree to pay the past due balance of $45.99 later on that day and asked the representative that I wanted a refund later for the payment I would be making because this was not my fault and was told that they couldn't directly issue a refund but that I could get this past due amount credited later on to my next bill cycle when I called back after paying the balance.

I end up paying the balance later on that day and get too distracted with other things to call back. Fast forward to yesterday just a couple hours ago and I remember to call about the past due credit for my next bill and to check that the credit for my gig installation went through. I call spectrum again to ask about any balance that is showing on my account to see if I can resolve and am told I still have around $300 to pay for some reason and she checks and sees that there are two instances of $75 in credit applied to my account as well as another of $49.99 which totaled up to $199.99 and checks the note to see exactly what happened but then tells me she doesn't have access to view it. 

The remaining balance of my overall total is just random stuff that I can't even remember because of how often I've been going back and forth with this company trying to resolve everything. In additon to all this mess she lets me know that she's still seeing an extra piece of hardware in my possesion and if I would like request a ticket to look into this and I ask her what that entails. She explains that I would be getting a call about this to see what's going on and I tell her I've already gone over this prior to this call and that I don't want to deal with this all over again as well as the issue with the payment that originally started the entire thing and how the first representative calling about the extra hardware and that the full balance not being transferred.

She tells me that this is not right and that there's no reason for service having been shown as active at my old house and that she would put another ticket explaining the whole situation. While on the phone, google ways or reasons to sue a cable company and one said that if billing issues haven't been resolved in the time limit that the company has set then there could be a case. I ask the lady exactly how long their policy for resolving billing issues is and she says that Spectrum has a 30 days billing resolution time limit. 

I ask her how long my case and all the issues stemming from the first problem at the very start that has been going on for verification and she says everything started the day I called to move my service to my new house which has now been over 60 days I ask if there's any documentation I can receive about the situation so I can have it on hand and she says she can't email anything to me but that I could request to have a copy of the notes on record on my account somehow sent to me if I called back tomorrow because there was no one who could access the notes available at the time. Is this something I can take to court or something because this is way to excessive and I'm tired of having to spend hours on the phone with Spectrum over the course of MULTIPLE phone calls. Everything I've mentioned may not be 100% accurate because I'm recalling everything from memory but of course everything discussed is on record and documented since Spectrum records all their phone calls.

TL;DR trying to figure out if I have a case to sue Spectrum because they can't get their act together.",1

I just want my last paycheck (michigan),2,dpsmqw,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dpsmqw/i_just_want_my_last_paycheck_michigan/,2,1572579261.0,"Hello people of reddit. I started a job last March as a security guard at a car dealership. I worked 10 hour shifts at a time 8pm-6am. I was given a secuirty car to use during that time. I was not given access to the dealership building only the parking lot. 
    
 So therefore going the bathroom you either go in the parking lot behind cars or leave the lot. Go up the road to McDonald's or whatever and use the restroom. There is also cameras on the building half ass facing the lot. Super shitty cameras I can't read a liscense plate on them from 10ft. away. 
     
So the other night (tuesday) i left the lot at 2am to use the restroom cause it wasn't pee time. Then ~15 minutes later I came back. Well my manager texted me (Wednesday) and asked if I stayed till my normal end time of 6am. I said i did. 
    
 Then they stated I never came back when I left the lot at 2am. They sent pictures of me leaving the lot. I came back I have no way of proving it but I came back. So they wanted me to turn in my keys for the security car and the lock on the gate to the dealership. I turned in the keys and provided a pre purchased envelope for them to mail me my last check (due to me this Friday). 
     
My manager then informs me they have other times of me leaving and never coming back. Which they are ""documenting"". But I have received no proof of. I'm also told to call and not text about any upcoming checks. I ignore that text and receive a call from the owner of the dealer later last night. I missed his first call and called him back. 

He says it was really shitty of me to leave all the time and never come back. They could go to the police for me embezzling the company leaving all the time and getting paid for it. 

Again I've never left and not come back nor have been given evidence of it. So lastly and this is the sketchiest  part the owner tells me you have 2 options.
Option 1 we can both go our separate ways and call it even  or Option 2 we can get the cops involved. I took option 1 but the call wasn't recorded so it cant be proven.

 But I know they won't send me my last check. Clearly if they had a legit embezzlement case they'd just move forward and not warn me about it right? I just want my two week pay from these assholes. I've already found another job. What should I do?",2

I'm in dire need of advice.

I was called into my associate dean's office where they told me that they had a complaint that I knowingly posting a video on my Instagram showing me and my partner in sexual acts. I thought it was ridiculous and told them that there was no way a video existed of me doing anything sexual and it would never end up on my Instagram. Which, as much as I knew, was the truth. So they dismissed me and told me they'd update me on what was happening if anything progressed.

Today I received this email:

>""As promised I am following up with you regarding the video in question. The attached file was anonymously sent to me. Please advise as to whether, now that you’ve seen it, you have any knowledge of the video or it being posted to your Instagram account.   
>  
>\-Associate Dean""

Attached to the email was the video and it was exactly what they had described. It looked like an iPhone screen recording of my story with a video I made with an ex 5 years ago that I completely forgot about. I haven't talked to my ex in 2-3 years and it was a pretty brutal breakup so I just didn't think of it but we definitely made this video.

What was really strange, other than it was up for at least an hour (according to the story stamp it said '1h') was that it had these captions on it:

""She sent this as a 'promo'""

""She said she was gonna blur my face but I don't want it up at all""

""Any ideas to prevent her from posting it without getting law enforcement involved?""

So I sent this as my reply:

&#x200B;

>""This is my first time seeing that video, that was my ex of over 5 years ago who I have not spoken to in a few years. I just tried phoning her with no response and just texted her to see if she has any idea of what's going on. Never thought about an old partner having a video of us. To my knowledge, that video was never on my Instagram, let alone left on my story for over an hour, I'm constantly on Instagram.   
>  
>I just changed my password and hope to update you soon. ""

&#x200B;

Followed soon with

>"" I can't seem to be able to reach her. I'm not sure what the video says about releasing a promo or getting law enforcement involved. We haven't talked at all within the last 2 or 3 years.

>Any ideas of what I can do? Please advise. ""

I'm completely stunned. I never thought a video like that would come back to haunt me.

My primary concern is to make sure that there is no legal ground to kick me out of school or prevent me from finishing my education as I'm in my second year and more than $150,000 in debt. Other concerns include, can I get in trouble for this? And what else can I do to mitigate the situation?

B) This is sitting on my credit as derogatory.

1. My questions are what type of attorney would I have to google?

2. Do I have a further case for any compensation for all the time I’ve spent with this?

3. Is there a possible way to pull a copy of the first 3 calls? Would an attorney be able to do this?

Thank you in advance.",1
Help with security deposits!,1,dpvme9,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dpvme9/help_with_security_deposits/,1,1572591848.0,Hi all. I’m currently about to move I into an apartment in Maryland. I have paid one month rent in advance plus a security deposit. I met the landlord the day before moving in and asked if my deposit would be placed in an escrow account. She says that it would cost them more money to open the account and the interest is too low to get any money. I am looking into this and finding that Maryland does require this. Also every other apartment I have rented in MD has required this for deposits over $50. Do I push this issue?,1

We have called the police on our neighbor multiple times over the past couple months after hearing altercations going on within the apartment. One time in particular, it was bad enough that he was arrested. Since then he has called the police after he has been abusive, and blamed our apartment (my boyfriend) for the commotion and the police showed up to our door.

We have been in contact with our leasing office and they have been helpful so far. We've given them the videos we have and reporting everytime something happens. 

However, we are nervous for our safety since he seems to be escalating towards us. We just found out we will likely be sobpoenaed as witnesses for the time he was arrested and are worried about retaliation, etc. Since he (obviously) knows where we live, we would like to reluctantly break our lease but wasn't sure if there's something that could help us, or the best stepts to take when discussing it with our leasing office in case there is a way we wouldn't have to pay the early termination fee since this seems to be out of our control.",0

That night I thought he was acting very strange and out of it and now realize he was drunk. Yesterday morning I discovered 7 empty liquor bottles of mine that were varying ranges of full before I left. All are empty. It has been two days and he is still in his room. I have heard him walk around a couple times,  but he is avoiding me. Now he is vomiting again. I keep asking if he is okay and he just says “I’m fine” through the door. I am wondering if he has all of the liquor in his room still and is drunk again or if he is still throwing up from binge drinking a few days ago.

The contract he signed doesn’t specifically state alcohol or belligerence, but only regarding illegal activity. Which, this was theft so I assume this counts? What are rights to kick him out? I feel uneasy and vulnerable in my home, especially with my daughter. How long do I have to give him? 

On a non-legal note but regarding safety of him, at what point should I call 911? Only if he is unresponsive? He is vomiting as I write this and has been for an hour.

I've lurked for a while and thought I could get some solid advice here. warning: this may be a bit long.

details: in the United States, married for a few years, together for about 8 years.

edit: I would never have known if she hadn't told me about it, so I doubt it is her. Plus, she's a terrible liar lol.

A few years ago, my wife came to me after leaving her work, where she was a server and tells me a story about an older gentleman who approached her and was nice, but a little ""creepy"". Granted, being young, female, and attractive, she was/is used to random guys being creepy or weird. but this was different. he talked like they knew each other and he had details about her schedule, car, etc. and recognized her from pictures.  eventually, they discover that he has been cat-fished by someone pretending to be her. weird, ok. But the kicker is that all of this happened on a ""kink"" social site and the cat-fisher was actively trying to recruit ""doms"" and ""stalkers"" to kidnap and rape her, and upload photos and videos, while giving ""consent"" posing as her.

Long story short, she has been approached by multiple men, at various places of employment (using information provided by the cat-fisher) over the last few years, who thankfully, are decent human beings and decided a face to face chat was appropriate. she has kept most of their information in case we could use it later for an investigation or something. unfortunately she is a bit put off by involving the police, because she originally contacted a detective who didn't seem to take it seriously, and only wanted to try and get her to go out with him, so she stopped pursuing it. it has been a few years and we have forgotten about it, only to have it come up again. I think we hoped they would get bored or move on, but that doesn't seem to be the case.

I have found the profile in question and it turns my stomach to see. There are multiple photos taken from her social media (now deactivated) that are badly cropped but clearly show her likeness. there are multiple instances where they described in posts where she was, or what she was doing, fairly accurately. the posts and pictures go back nearly 10 years.

Possibly unrelated, but she also has a random person who will leave a little ""love note"" or a flower on her car once or twice a year for a few years now. honestly, its just exhausting and I want to help her get past this but we don't really know where to start. do we hire a private investigator? can we contact the FBI (conspiracy to commit kidnapping, rape etc)? we don't know where to start or what to do to actually get this to stop. My wife has said she just wants to know who it is.

When I applied to this job, I submit documentation stating I am disabled. I work for a company that is a ""Federal Partner of the Year""... That said they treat their employees horrifically. HR (barely real HR) knows I am disabled, as does my direct manager and direct team lead on the project I report to. 

So I have a new boss (team lead) as of the last month. I won't get into the whole conversation. In general, she was checking to see how I was feeling and we got on the topic of how I had been out sick for the last three days in some shape or form. (To be clear, I had still signed in to assist her while I was extremely ill, so this wasn't about me not assisting her for three days.) I basically informed her like, I am legally disabled so sometimes I become ill, randomly, and there's nothing I can do to stop it. I have just been born this way, and that's why I have a medical note saying I have the right to work from home whenever I deem medically necessary. She said something to the effect of 'oh wow, I had no idea you were so sickly.' I said... 'Why would you? I don't exactly go around broadcasting it, but you're my direct lead so I think it is important for you to know.' 

And then she said... Verbatim words... ""I just want you to know, when people like you accomplish things, it puts a smile on the face of everyone around them."" .......... She went into a 5 minute long spiel about how someone from her friend group in college had a baby who is also disabled, and how she hasn't worked a day since that child was born (he's in high school now) because she needs to take care of him, and how she instead like does small creative things and sells them for money... Basically trying to find some weird common ground of I know a disabled person, but okay.

So I told HR this comment made me really uncomfortable and they told me to discuss it directly with her. When I did, of course she did not see a problem with it, she thought she was being positive and uplifting. I told her that maybe she didn't intend it, but that phrasing was really offensive and a lot of people would be offended by it. And she just needed to be more careful about phrasing things like 'people like you' and discussing disabilities around me, because if you had replaced ""people like you"" with any group of people, it would absolutely be seen offensively.

All of this to say, I don't really want to sue her, but I want to protect myself in case this becomes a reoccurring problem or situation. Considering HR is the worst, I'm concerned I will need to do this myself. I've literally never had a co-worker say anything like that in my entire life. I live and work in an area where I can record things via one party consent, and I've considered doing that. Is there anything else I can do to protect myself legally from the ableist mindset this woman obviously has?",0

Basically putting me down however it was all delusional. I actually believe this person is on drugs. They were in a really low place and I decided to be nice and help them out by allowing them the payment plan as they had no reliable means of transportation. To sum up our relationship, a decade ago I had a restraining order on them but was trying to be a nice person; I thought over the years we were able to mend our relationship but was recently made aware they still do not care for me with very specific wording they chose to use. Definitely shame on me as this is a close ""relative."" Due to all this I no longer wish to deal with this person and demanded they bring the car back. I would like to remove them from my life completely. This relative said I couldnt do that because they've invested 2k into the car (it's been a year of payments but the car is currently worth 8k today) and that they would be taking my other close relative to court (they were making the payments to them, not me). We have no contract stating they were making payments in the process of purchasing the car. Is there a chance this can hold up in court? The car is in both mine and the relative receiving payment's name. What is the worse that can happen? I have to reimburse the ""buyer"" for the amount they paid? That's fine as long as I can make payments as well. Or can I consider it wear and tear/damages fees/a ""loaner"" fee? The car isnt in the best condition now internally (cigarette burns on the beige leather seats, tint was removed unprofessionally) so I would have an even harder time getting the full value for the car.

Before my girlfriend and I rented this apartment, we were looking over the lease and found a clause that said ""reasonable heat"" would be included. We emailed Mark asking about it, and his response was the following:

>Heat, Hot Water, Water, Sewerage Disposal, Refuse Removal, Snow Removal & one off-street parking spot is included in the monthly rent.  Clause 3 (page 2) is standard boiler plate language.  **The landlord is responsible & will cover ALL of the heating costs.**

Yes, that says ""ALL"" in big old capital letters, ""ALL of the heating costs."" Thanks Mark, we'll take it, sounds GREAT!

Well, our apartment has electric heat, and this October we decided to give it a test drive not only because it was cold but also just to confirm that heat is indeed included. We were even gone on vacation for 10 days out of the month-long billing period...

...yet when we got the bill, the price (and kWh usage) of our electricity bill from Eversource was more than double this month. Bruh it's not even winter.

We were deceived here, and it's extremely frustrating. We specifically moved away from our previous apartment due to exorbitant heating costs, and even accepted an increase of $100 from the original listed rent to move in to this place because with heat covered, it would still have been less expensive. We wouldn't have signed the lease here at *all* if we had known we'd be footing the bill for heat here too.

We forwarded the electricity bill, and the aforementioned email from Mark, to our Property Mgmt company. Mark was cc'd as well. Sure enough, Property Mgmt told us that, in fact, heat was not included. Mark also responded, and told us that he got the incorrect info he shared with us from a *different* agent who listed the property.

Mark wants to have a call with us today or tomorrow. Property Mgmt said they would ""get back to us"" after they have ""researched"" the situation, which is code for they probably won't move much on this unless we push them. What can I do here? I've never had to take any kind of legal action before, but the staggering unfairness of this situation is really making me want to pursue something.

I would greatly appreciate some advice on this matter, I've been in this predicament for about 2 months now.

**Background:** 
Location: Virginia, USA. 
Auto Transporter picks up car from auction house, drives it to my destination. Upon destination, drops car off trailer when unloading. 100% his fault, no doubt about it. Provides insurance information (Really didn't want to).
Insurance company says they obtained a receipt from the auction house that the car sold for ~$1,000. The auction house sold to the dealer I bought it from. Dealer sold me the car for $2000 with $300 processing fees. I provided my Buyer Order, which includes VIN, cost breakdown, sale date, signatures, etc. Paid in cash.
The Transporters' insurance company says the document isn't a Bill of Sale, thus their estimate is a maximum payout of $1000 based on the receipt from the auction.

I have fought with them back and forth that the document is a Bill of Sale, and the dealer has told it is the Bill of Sale. Yet, they are using a receipt from the auction house to determine the cars value, and have informed me they can't pay above the cost of the vehicle they obtained.

Does this seem factual? How can I convince them my cost genuinely was $2300 as listed on my paperwork? The vehicle sustained most definitely over $1000 in damage from being dropped, and it would cost me more than $1000 to get another one. So I'm kinda being screwed over currently. I also do not have my own insurance on this vehicle.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",5

I'm a college student who is employed by the college, working in the residence life department.  At the beginning of the year, we signed a contract of employment, but since then, the college has revoked some of the bonuses that they initially promised (totaling to about a loss of 320 dollars).

Essentially, I'm wondering if there's anything that I can do here.  I know college employment is a bit different than a normal job and the contract could just be a meaningless formality, but I'm hoping I have some grounds to try to get the bonuses reinstated.

My two good friends entered a lease agreement together, Friend A owns the house (North Carolina) and Friend B is in a month to month change as needed lease with Friend A

A recently had their license revoked and is living with their SO and is no longer living in the home rented to B. Friend B pays $300 a month to live in the home. After A moved, B also agreed to care for A’s animals while A was living with their SO (this was a verbal agreement, not part of the original lease agreement, also, if its important we are talking about SEVERAL animals, about 2-3 hours every day of animal care) B has been paying for the food for these animals without it being added to rent or being part of the contract

Throughout renting from A the utilities at the home have been shut off several times due to A not paying them on time with no warning given to B that the utilities were not being paid (the power is currently off and there is no running water at the moment if that matters) 

I know its against housing codes to not provide utilities to your renters but the thing I’m questioning is A has brought two renters into the home without giving B any notice or doing background checks (the first one was some random they met at a gas station and the second being a mutual friend of ours)

Currently B and one other person, are living at the home but our mutual friend is going to be living there soon as well

There was also a disagreement about how A’s animals were being treated which prompted A to raise B’s rent and if he did not agree to this new contract then he would be given 30 days to move out (this contract hasn’t been signed yet to my knowledge)

Today, I received an e-mail from the FTC regarding a recent settlement with Devumi, a website that sold things like YouTube views. Apparently, a settlement was reached. They had my e-mail on record and said if I still had subscribers, views, or likes, I had to delete them all.

The problem is, I didn't buy the views for myself. I bought them for a YouTuber I don't even know in real life. I used the service a total of three time, last time in 2017, and had no idea buying YouTube views was even illegal.

The e-mail also says ""It’s illegal to pay for social media followers to increase your influence. Companies and individuals that break the law may face a lawsuit from the FTC. A court could order violators to stop the illegal behavior and pay a money judgment."".

Yes it was 24 hour notice but can they just block out several days under one notice? I didn't go to work one day because we have 2 cats in a one bedroom apartment who don't get along well enough to lock them in the bathroom for 8 hours so they don't accidentally get out while strangers enter our apartment when we're not home. 

We also had planned to go out of town tomorrow 11/1 but they still haven't came to inspect our apartment which means they should be here tomorrow maybe? 

I don't know, I'm just concerned of the legalities of such a vague 24hr notice since there's no specific date that they're even coming just a general 3 day window.

We can't lock our cats up and go out of town for several days but I also don't want to not lock them up but then be gone for many days after knowing someone entered our place without checking to be sure everything was OK before leaving.

Edit: Wonder if it's okay to call them tomorrow morning stating that their notice on 10/28 wasn't specific enough and that since they didn't give notice on 10/31 to enter for 11/1 then they do not have permission to enter and that we've set our alarm and will be out of town.",1

Their ""official"" policy is I have a set date range to pick up my items, but theyve always told me they don't clear things out until two weeks have passed so it's OK if I pick up late. This is how things have functioned for years, although on their site they give 4 business days after the auction ends to retrieve everything. 

Earlier this week I went in to pick up around $500 worth of items 10 days after the auction endes but they told me they'd been relotted because I was too late. I checked the items and they were still in the same spot and checked their website and they had not been put up for auction. What's more is one of my items wasn't even there, something which they typically refund for in the past. When I questioned them about this they said I'm shit out of luck. 

Yeah I know what the official rules say but this has been sprung on me suddenly after literal years of operating differently. Is this something they can enforce? They are basically saying they get my money but I get nothing. Currently I have no paper trail on this issue. 

This is the relevant portion of their policy: ""NO refunds or charge backs will be granted due to a lack of removal at the designated times. After the scheduled removal items will be considered abandoned and you will be charged a removal fee for disposal of your items""",1

Hey Reddit, I'm a broke college student and this ticket really put me in a pinch, so I'm wondering if I have a good case to contest. I was written up for failure to stop at a stop sign on a street I was not on, and to top off being a broke college student, for tags that were 1.5 months expired.

I told the cop that I was not familiar with the area and I did not see the stop sign. Also, that I had just picked my cousin up because she was fleeing from a crazy roommate situation and we were grabbing her stuff before her crazy roommate came (tried to get some pity--didn't work). To this, he replied ""do you have stop signs where you're from?"" in the most condescending manner which signaled to me that this guy was just trying to get me for anything.

Anyways, on the ticket, he wrote down the wrong color of the car I was driving. Also, wrote down a different cross street which my cousin confirmed we did not drive on because we went straight from campus to her apartment. The cross street that he wrote down would have taken us in a circle. Furthermore, when he ticketed me, we were already parked at the apartment and it was so sudden, I honestly had no idea why I would have been ticketed other than for the expired tags. I know he can still give me a ticket if I made it, but honestly I either think he followed the wrong car or was just trying to pin something else on me when he saw my expired tags.

I'm not sure if I have a good case, so please help me out! Thanks. Also, I have a  ticket deferred, so that is not an option.",0
"Received an EZ-Pass fine from New York in the mail with a unrecognized license plate.

However, I have not been to New York, nor would I drive there. I live in Maryland. Additionally, the license plate is not mine, nor is the picture provided of the vehicle, which looks to be a Kia. I drive a Subaru, and my license number is vastly different from the letter's number provided. 

Okay, so let me lay out all the facts that I know:

I've called EZ-Pass of New York via their online website phone number just in case the letter was fake. They told me I have to dispute it through a written letter, which I think is absurd since I didn't cause this mess. However, I get it. They need to make sure I am being honest. The bill is due 11/11/2019. Anyway, they also said that I have a Kia Sportage under my name, which is the vehicle from the letter.

Then, I called the MVA to find out more information. They confirmed the Kia Sportage is under my name as of June 2019. Additionally, my Subaru is listed as well. The person I spoke with gave me the name of the company that the vehicle was purchased from, which is located in Maryland. I will mention the MVA again later because I called them a second time after this.

So, I called this dealership, which is a legit place that has been around for years (to my knowledge). The manager there remembers the sale from June 2019 being connected to my full name. However, the address and date of birth are different, which he couldn't tell me for safety purposes. This got me thinking...hmm, maybe there is another with my same exact name since mine is quite common. He also reminded me that license plates are only handled through the MVA, so I called them back up.

Now, I ask the MVA to look up my name and the vehicle under question owner's name. They are the same. However, the address is different then what I gave her. This is where it gets interesting. The date of birth is the same month and day as mine, except the year is different. The representative from the MVA is baffled at this point. I am under the impression that maybe there is just someone with the same name and similar date of birth. However, she looks a bit deeper and cannot find a license listed under the purchase and registration of the Kia Sportage, which apparently is alarming. The representative then says it may actually be true that someone has used my identity/license/etc. to obtain this vehicle. I have the number to call the MVA's investigative services tomorrow morning, but until then...nothing.

With all that being said, I do have proof that I was working at my job in Maryland the day of the EZ-Pass New York incident. However, I still need to locate proof that I did not purchase the vehicle in June 2019. Finally, I have checked my bank accounts and credit score. Both are seemingly fine with no odd transactions made or accounts opened. I have set up a password for my bank account as well for added security. Additionally, the bank representative looked through my account as well and could not find anything. I assume if someone did steal my identity, they would have made a purchase by now since they potentially used my info to purchase a car in June. Am I the victim of identity theft or was this just a simple MVA mix up? Please help me figure this out and what my next steps should be.",61

I cannot talk about the exact nature of the product for obvious confidential data, however I can give some general details, which I’ll do after explaining my problem.

This device is somewhat similar in concept to another preexisting device and patent which, to my knowledge, is still in effect. This product and mine have ultimately the same purpose and method of achieving the desired effect, however apart from that most aspects are different. The control scheme of mine is vastly different and has more options, theirs is a handheld version whereas mine is one which would attach to the user like a collar, theirs uses an angle of activation determined by the user whereas mine is predetermined in the design process. While the makers of the device do produce and have patented a collar version, it is a holder for the main device which retains the original control scheme, albeit adapting it to be controlled by the head via the original hand control methods (mine would be controlled by a held controller wired to the collar and does not offer a handheld version of the full device). There are a good amount of other differences, and all design and testing data for mine would be collected by hand in a series of composition lab notebooks in pen, such that any changes to them would be blatantly apparent.

My question is how viable would a patent infringement case made against my product from theirs be, given the information provided?

I was leaving my house for work early in the morning and was hit early in the morning by a woman running a red light inside of an intersection. 

Airbags were deployed. I immediately got out of the car and checked to see if she was alright. She was, so we moved our cars out of the intersection and into a gas station parking lot. (I understand now that I should've left the cars as they were until state police got there, but please bear with me as this was my first ever auto accident) 

State police came and got statements. The lady claimed she had no idea what had happened. I told her that she ran the red light and ran into me. Overall the experience was completely pleasent other than my car being totaled. 

She goes by ambulance (it looked like she might have broken her forearm) so I get her insurance information from the police officer. 

I call the insurance company (State Farm) and give my statement and other information. Very nice conversation. I also send them a copy of the police report, which included the citation for running a red light. 

About 10 minutes ago, I got a call from State Farm stating my claim has been denied. I ask why, thinking maybe they didn't see the citation on the police report. They say, there wasn't any eye witnesses, so there is no way to prove she ran a red light. I start getting heated, obviously. 

I tell State Farm about the citation that's on the police report. State Farm states, and I quote ""Police reports are based off of word of mouth, so it's not actual evidence."" (This doesn't make any sense to me....is this true?) I got a bit emotional due to being in a tight financial spot. I tell her I have no car and I have the police citation. What more evidence do you need? State Farm just apologies and repeats the same phrase. I hang up. 

I need a car. I live in Virginia. You can't get around on public transportation, and I don't have the money for a new one. I was hoping to use the one grand they might give me for a little beater or something while I save for a better car. 

My insurance is going to make me pay a $500 deductible in order to help me at all. Which I'd be able to afford in a month. But if I can help it, I'd prefer to not wait so long.

My totaled car is sitting in a tow yard racking up fees.

Please, please. If anyone can give me any advice on this it would be greatly appreciated. Maybe I'm not understanding something. This is my first accident. I've never even gotten a ticket or been in a fender bender. Please help me.

We've been experiencing some significant issues lately, and although we've been seeing a counselor and trying to take the proper steps to get them the love and support they need, we're in a situation where I think I might need some legal advice, even if it's informal.

This morning they claimed they were going to run away, before leaving for school. I'm not sure how serious this threat was, but I'm taking it seriously. There's also some intimations from school staff that they've made claims about abusive behavior by me and my spouse. (For the record: There isn't anything like that going on. They get shown love, affection, support and while we do insist they do things like get up in the morning and attend school, we're not being abusive about it. However, I also recognize that I'm one of the targets of their claims, so I have a conflict of interest. Take it for what it's worth).

My questions:

1) What kind of steps can I take to protect my kid if they decide to run away? I gather it's not illegal to do that in Washington.

2) If they go to another person's home to stay there, what recourse do I have? Should/can the police compel them to return? Is this a good idea or a bad one?

3) If they escalate this to the point of claiming we've been abusive and a mandated reporter (rightly so, I might add- I fully support the idea that if there's suspicion of something, it should be checked out) involves CPS or its state equivalent, what are my rights, and what steps should I take or not take to protect myself and my child?

I'm sorry if this seems vague. We're very concerned about our kid's welfare and future, and we're trying to make sure that we get them the help they need, but we're worried that this may be moving in a direction that's going to be bad for everyone.",2
Not sure if violating non-compete?,1,dptsne,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dptsne/not_sure_if_violating_noncompete/,3,1572584114.0,"-This all takes place in Tennessee

-Signed a non-compete with Company A upon joining. Wording of non-compete was brief and general.

-Received offer from badass new Company B: significantly higher pay, benefits, opportunities, etc.

-Without getting too specific, working for Company B could technically be considered a violation of the non-compete; the non-compete specifies that I am not allowed to work for ""a company of this type"" which Company B technically is

-However, Company B deals with an entirely different type of product as Company A. It is an entirely different set of customers/prospects. I would not be bringing over any existing customers or calling on the same types of customers as I was at Company A (which is the primary purpose of the non-compete). I did not receive any special training from Company A, and I would not be taking over any trade secrets.

-Given all this I thought it unlikely that Company A would think it worth it to spend time money and resources pursuing me, but I did want 100% peace of mind.

-Upon receiving offer from Company B, I asked if they could include in my contract a clause that they would provide legal assistance in the unlikely event that Company A decided to sue or send a cease and desist.

-They were not willing to put that in my contract, but they said I could send over a copy of my non-compete for their legal department to look over and assure me that it was safe to go ahead and quit.

-I sent it over and immediately regretted doing so. Still waiting to hear back from Company B. Still working for Company A, and nobody there is aware that I am trying to leave (hence the throwaway)

-Also I formally accepted their offer, but again, they are still processing the non-compete and have been for three full business days now.

-My question is: have I, by providing the non-compete, made Company B liable if they hire me knowing that I would be breaching a non-compete? They knew about it before, but does having it in writing in front of their legal department somehow change things? Will they require that I get a waiver from Company A?

They have always maintained the hedges and plants which provided a nice privacy barrier between us but at the cost of me having a smaller side pathway to the backyard. They are about 5 really small and thin trees that just grew very dense leaves, about 5'-6' tall.

My plan was to remove the trees and build a fence around the yard. It would increase the size of my yard and still provide the barrier. I showed him the marking and told him that I would like his plants/ trees removed in one week. He called me crazy and threatened to sue me but I tried to explain to him that it's my property. One week passed and he did not remove them. I initially just trimmed the branches because they were getting messy. Another week passed and I came home to the trees gone. It was not done by me.

I then received a cease and desist letter from their lawyer in which it states that they are charging me for damage done to the trees plus labor times 3 for $1500. The letter includes references to ""**California Civil Code 833 and 834**: California law provides that trees whose trunks stand on the land of one owner belong to him exclusively, even if their roots/branches grow into the land of your neighbor."" It also states that I shall not trespass or harass the neighbor. Prior to this we rarely even said hello to each other so this was pure bs. 

It also states that their client purchased the property and planted those 16 years ago and that the property manager told him it was his land and that I had no right to ""go onto their property."" 

The letter basically read as if the lawyer thought it was his property. It says I have 14 days to send payment to them or else they will pursue further action. Should I lawyer up and counter sue him for the value of those trees since technically they were mine?

Thank you

**TLDR**: Neighbor suing me for removing trees that he planted on my property thinking that the land was his.

No damage, no scratch, no nothing. She got out then made a scene and called the police and ambulance. The EMT saw she was in no pain and perfectly fine so they left.

Since then she's been trying to sue me and claim for medical expenses and for her husband too b/c her being in the accident somehow didn't allow her for some family time. My insurance has been fighting it for the whole year and I think it got too dragged out that they don't want to insure me any more so I had to change my insurance plan.

My question is should I file the financial affidavit? I'm super hesitant cause it required me to divulge personal information. Also how the fuck didn't my insurance fight that they don't have any grounds to sue instead of settling it?

Real Estate Lawyers: Need Advice,0,dpth1t,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dpth1t/real_estate_lawyers_need_advice/,6,1572582757.0,"Hey,

So I just had a quick question regarding my lease. First and foremost I live in Massachusetts, USA (not sure if that matters).

Anyway, me and my roommate lived in our apartment for a year until the end of September, which is when our lease ended. We did not live in the apartment the whole month of October other than the last 2-3 days. We planned on signing a new lease with the company for another year. A new company (current) bought the old company starting in October. I made 3-5 phone calls in the month of October to sign a new lease. The man on the phone said that the systems were down and that we would receive an email soon regarding the new lease and have 30 days to sign it. (Note.. I still have not received the lease and asked again for it and they said it would be coming soon starting the month of November). So far we are living here waiting for the lease to be given to us.

My question is:
- since me and my roommate did not live in the apartment since the end of September (although our furniture was here) and we returned at the end of October, with our lease ending in September (so being on no lease atm), do we need to pay October’s rent?
- we did not receive any eviction notice other than “we’ll send you an email when the lease for November is ready and you’ll have 30 days to sign it”. Are we contractually required to pay October’s rent when we are not under any lease and have not physically been living here?

"Ex husband wants to move back into the property after 6 years, evicting my long term tenant at my expense?",27,dphckv,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dphckv/ex_husband_wants_to_move_back_into_the_property/,11,1572518316.0,"We have a property in Kelowna, BC (Canada) that has two small houses on it. We are both on title, the mortgage comes out of my personal checking account. Six years ago when we split he moved into the back house then injured his hand and was unable to work. I paid the full mortgage myself, even bought his groceries because I didn't want my kids to go without.

Shortly thereafter he moved to Vancouver, essentially abandoning me with the property. I got a great tenant who has been there ever since. At first he was like ""I'll pay the insurance on the house, that will be my contribution"" but about a year later he fessed up that he hadn't paid the insurance in a year and that we have been uninsured this whole time. So, I started paying the insurance too.

He's been completely hands off this entire time. When the hot water tank failed he just said ""well no way I can afford to pay into that, figure it out"". I've replaced two dishwashers, hot water tank, flooring, I've been solely responsible for all the management of the rental and maintenance and repairs of the entire property, insurance mortgage taxes water and garbage removal, everything, he's contributed nothing.

It's worked fine for me because he has never paid child support, ever, so I've got it arranged that the rental covers almost all the mortgage and I only have to pay $300 a month. This enables me to put our one daughter through university and support our other daughter - feed, house, dance, etc. I even pay for the girls car insurance and cell phones, he literally contributes nothing.

This is important because I was seriously injured in February 2017 and I'm still waiting for my settlement case, so I'm living on a shoestring but am making it work.

In the beginning of October he emailed to say that he was thinking of maybe moving back up here and that he might want to evict my tenant in around the spring. Well, he waited until I was in the Philippines for 2 weeks to pop up and basically say ""you can evict her or I will, but I'm moving back into my house.""

When I asked if he would honor the arrangement I already had, which has enabled me to raise his daughters at no expense to himself, he said no. Not only does he expect to Waltz back in after contributing nothing these past six years, but now my cost of living is going to go up $1000/month. And under BC residential tenancy the tenant is due a months rent free, which he expects ME to pay half of ""as my contribution to the partnership.""

He's unstable. He's moved 5 times in the last 5 years. His plan is to kick out a stable long term tenant who has grown to be a great friend but more importantly is the best tenant anyone could ever ask for, and replace her with my a-hole tyrant of an entitled ex husband and his hostile girlfriend who doesn't even want my daughter's to say my name in her presence. My cost of living will go up by $1000/month and even before he moves in he's expecting me to share his moving expenses with him. Doesn't care how it will negatively affect me and our children, literally said ""that's not my problem"" so he fully expects me to now subsidize him and his girlfriend. I could just scream.

He waited the day then went and had my tenant served with an eviction notice (at her work!), listing himself as the only landlord.

Note, I have a tenancy agreement with her. Me. Not him. He's nobody to her. He's PART of the ownership but I've kept this whole show afloat on my own and she doesn't even know him.

So at this point, I casually told my tenant not to worry and file a dispute. I told him that he's not the landlord and doesn't have the power to evict her and he should take me to court where we can flush this all out fairly where so he can't bully me anymore.

Advice or suggestions? Follow-up questions? I'd love to get some more perspective on this if anyone has any. Thanks in advance!

I’m being sued by my downstairs neighbor in a condo complex.,3,dpoblm,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dpoblm/im_being_sued_by_my_downstairs_neighbor_in_a/,11,1572560955.0,"I own a second story condo unit in Florida that I rent out to college kids. About a year ago the washing machine needed to be replaced so I ordered a new one to be delivered. But before the other one could be installed we had to cut off the water, but the pipe to the machine was old and it’s shut off valve was not turning easily. So instead we decided to cut off the water to the unit outside at the main shut off valve just to be safe. However, there are several units in my building so I called the maintenance man for the condo association to show me which valve was to my unit. He could not make it there immediately and I had to go, so I told the tenant to wait and have the maintenance man show him which valve was ours. A little while after I left, the maintenance man shows up. However, he doesn’t know which valve is mine either. He asks the tenant why he needs to know and the tenant tells him that they are getting a new washer and the valve inside is stuck. The maintenance man says that he knows how to fix it and goes inside and attempts to turn the valve off with force and he snaps the pipe and water begins to flood the whole unit. The maintenance man then runs outside and takes 20 minutes before he can locate the shut off valve outside and turns off the water to the unit. So in total, water was shooting out of this pipe for at least 20 minutes and flooded my whole unit. My floors were damaged slightly but the unit below mine was damaged much more severely. 

The condos story is that the maintenance man showed up and immediately pointed out the outside shut off valve to the tenant. (However neither the tenant or the maintenance man turned off the water then). Then they both went into the unit and the maintenance man was just holding the light for the tenant when the tenant broke the pipe. Which is total bullshit because while the tenant is a nice kid, he is not the DIY type at all. Also if that was true, why did it take 20 minutes to shut off the valve if they knew where it was located? 

As a result my floors were damaged but it wasn’t bad enough to fight the Condo and get lawyers involved immediately so I just forgot about it. However, the unit below mine did get a lot more damage and I just got a letter from that units insurance saying they are going to sue me and they are not allowed to sue the condo association. 

What should I do?

Edit: Didnt have homeowners insurance on the unit at the time. When I bought it, the condo association said I didn’t really need it because their insurance covers everything and I pay for that in my monthly fees. However when I contacted the insurance after this incident, they said that they only cover the shell of the building and nothing inside.",3

The apartment complex I live in doesn't turn their heating on even though we are already below the 50's,0,dpt500,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dpt500/the_apartment_complex_i_live_in_doesnt_turn_their/,1,1572581344.0,"24M

Detroit, MI

As explained in the title, the building I'm currently renting from uses a water radiation system to heat the building and its individual units. Although we've been having colder temperatures (below 50's) the heat in my unit hasn't been running more than about 20 minutes for days at a time. This was an issue I've brought up with management but the only response I've been given is usually ""did you turn the knob to open the pipes for the water to run?"" or ""we're adding more hours onto the timer now,"" but it isn't really showing. I've asked some of my other neighbors if their heat has been running either and most of them tell me no with the occasional ""I think it did while I was sleeping"".

This was also an issue around the same time last year when we experienced below 0 temperatures for 3-4 days straight. I believe the pipes froze due to the gaps of time in between the cycles of the heat being on. The entire place went without heat for those few days and it felt like it was below freezing in the whole building for those 2-3 days. After that entire issue, I went down to speak to management about it and they offered me a $50 credit towards my rent.

Heat is included in my rent and I understand what comes with that. Was also considering buying a space heater as well but I have an open studio loft so I'd have to buy a forced air unit that runs off propane. I wouldn't be able to afford to pay for propane throughout the entire winter on top of my current expenses. I'm also concerned for the other families and children that live here as well. The cost of living has only been going up in Midtown/Downtown Detroit so most of them don't want to move because they've lived here for 5+ years and their rent hasn't went budged from when they first moved in.

I'd really just like to know if there's anything I can do or anyone I can possibly speak to because this seems kind of ridiculous... or if I'm just being spoiled and need to suck it up, please let me know.

The owner of the building is also notorious for cutting corners to maximize profit.

I am a mininum wage kitchen employee in a fairly large, corporate chain restaurant which uses a tip pooling system. Without going into specifics, the servers keep X% of their tips, the rest is put into a team tip pool which is then split weekly among the other employees (kitchen, barback, managers, hosts, etc.) based on the ammount of hours they've worked in that week. There is a small commitee of people (myself included) who spend some of our free time every week divying and distributing these tipouts before/after shifts. I am not allowed to bring more people into the commitee (important later).

Over the past month or so, the rest of the commitee has been slacking, forcing me to pull most of the weight and spend more time working on this (usually alone). I get 1 scheduled day off a week, which i usually spend walking an hour to work, 3-4 hours divying tips (usually between 3 and 6 grand in cash), and then another hour walking home. Every single week. For free. This is a very physically and mentally exhausting task which I do not want to do, but I do it out of courtesy for the rest of the employees who rely on these tips.

1 week ago, I was told that I'm not supposed to work on tipout alone (which makes sense as I'm handling money), however I've also been told I'm not allowed to do it in the office where there's a camera (not allowed to be in there alone), I'm also not allowed to work on it inside the dining room since I shouldn't be handling large ammounts of money near customers. 

I come in on my day off again this week to work on tipout and surprise surprise, no one else shows up. Since I can't work on it alone and as I mentioned earlier I can't bring in new employees to help me, i took what I believed to be my only option and called a friend (not an employee, but mutuals with most of them and widely known/trusted in the restaurant) to come sit with me while I do it (at no point did she handle any money, she just sat there and talked with me so I wasn't alone). A manager came up to me absolutely livid that a non-employee was helping me with tipout, at which point the manager told me to pack it up, and that I would no longer be able to touch tipout, this is when she informed me I could be terminated for this, and she has since emailed our District Manager to attempt this.

There are other issues with this system which I can elaborate on in an edit if requested, but to keep it simple I'll leave them out for now.



This tipout system is clearly flawed, so these are my questions for you helpful people:

Is this policy even legal? 

If no one does tipout then nobody gets their tips, should I/someone else be paid/compensated for working on this every week?

Can I be terminated/disciploned for a volunteer position which I perform off the clock?

If it worth getting the labor department involved? Upper management are pretty understanding and friendly people (thankfully), but would I be better off dealing with this through an official 3rd party?

Tl;dr: Got in trouble at work for a task which I do on a volunteer basis for free, can they legally terminate/discipline me for it?",0

Utah legislation, if that matters.

1. Promises $10/hr to get staff, after they quit (he yells a lot) tells them that he'd never pay that much to such a bad staff member and that he never promised it
2. Upon someone quitting from the location he manages, he fires them from the nearby one if they work there as well (retaliation, right?)
3. Takes money from tip drawer to cover missing cash register money
4. Has confessed to lying about having staff have to pay for mistakes they make, often says afterwards to the cooks that he lies about that to make them feel bad and work harder
5. He'll hire people then fire them before 40hrs have been worked because their policy says they can be fired without 2wks notice like that
6. Consistently manipulative (example: talks about how he wants to give people raises, but they don't make enough money. He words this in a way to make people feel bad)
7. When yelling, it tends to be manipulation to make the worker feel bad.
8. Text to worker after they quit: ""Hey, when did i talk about increase your wage $10? I never give a that much money like you. I only said you if you get a successful with training and help and front and kitchen for our business then i will increase you. But you never get help no one.

Also, I still increasing wages for others, not you Kathryn."" Verbatim, including capitalization etc., with \[sic\] on a few things to point them out.
9. More texts, ""We are not sending you pay check to direct deposit. Because you are terminated."" ""After this week."" ""From every locatuons\[sic\]"" ""Thanks"" (Separated separate texts)
10. Staff called in asking whether they should go to work after having bloody diarrhea, manager told them to come in and not to call a sick day
11. Upon one staff member quitting, removed their S.O. from the schedule (i.e. took away their hours that had been scheduled) and they ended up quitting as well pretty soon after.
12. Called a staff member into work at 8:30am, showed up an hour late and made the worker wait outside the locked store for a while.
13. After one staff member quit, both the manager and his favorite to replace him for manager (has been told he will become manager if he stays, possibly just to keep him from quitting) called/texted the staff member to rant at them about not going to work.
14. Makes staff find their own replacements to cover their shifts.
15. Pulls staff in for more than the agreed amount of hours they were to work.
16. Lies a lot, then gets very upset when lied to.
17. Will yell at staff for putting broom in the wrong place, including at 8am and such.
18. An assistant manager agreed to throw away a broken mop head, manager in question (not assistant manager) called staff member at 8am to yell at them for throwing away this mop head that a different staff threw away. Tells staff member he called to come into work that day because he doesn't like his attitude (said so) and had a ""conference"" with them for 45min off the clock.

Question regarding overtime pay and dates of the hours worked. [Western NY],2,dppstj,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dppstj/question_regarding_overtime_pay_and_dates_of_the/,14,1572567301.0,"Every year around the holidays, my employer decides to close the shop on Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years. These are paid holidays. However, she also decides to close the shop the days before. These are not paid holidays, but she allows the workers to work a Saturday earlier in the month and get paid for those hours as if we had worked the non-paid holidays.

For example, we will be closed for a non-paid holiday the day before Thanksgiving. If we want to be paid for it, we have to work those hours on Saturday the 23rd. The hours we worked that saturday will be logged as if they had been worked the day before Thanksgiving and we will be paid our normal hourly rate. 

My concern is that since we are working a Saturday, those hours would normally be overtime rate since it would have us working more than 40 hours that week. But instead, we will be paid later at a standard rate. 

My question is: am I entitled to my overtime rate? And is this legal? I normally wouldn't mind since we all work a lot of Saturdays anyway, but we aren't paid fantastically, so the extra money can go a long way.

So here I am in the process of buying a new house and it turns out this house has a lot of issues including mold foundation etc and they said they won't lower the price so we are going to walk. so I was thinking about taking the home inspection report and post on local buy sell trade Facebook pages simply saying if you're interested in the house at this address here is a home inspection report we have. I wouldnt say anything about it but simply post the report. Is there any legal ramifications against me for that?

This is the exact same listing agent of the house I looked at a few years ago. they are notorious for not disclosing things and it's the second time I've wasted money on a home inspection report when this should have been disclosed prior.

At its worst for me I had to wait on over $600 over the course of 3-4 weeks. Needless to say this has been hugely inconvenient and has caused a ripple effect of paused student loan payments, inability to fix my car, other peripheral costs that have stacked up. On top of that, we are ordered to clock in and immediately take our lunch breaks. Every shift I've worked I don't get any additional breaks, all of them are unofficial, running to the back of restaurant while no one covers me at the bar, 1-3 mins max.

Ontario Landlord/Tenancy Board Rights: [http://www.sjto.gov.on.ca/ltb/faqs/](http://www.sjto.gov.on.ca/ltb/faqs/)

Recently come into a renting situation that is very uncomfortable. I moved into a 3-bedroom apartment in the beginning of June 2019 for a 14-month lease… I know. When I moved in there was one empty bedroom from a tenant residing in his home for the Summer and wasn’t returning and one roommate who happens to be the landlord and owner’s son. My other roommate moved in at the start of school (August), and was pleasant until all the hard r N word’s and anti-LGBTQ+ slowly started revealing themselves. Just looking to see if there’s anything in here that would potentially let me break the lease and leave early, mostly for my mental sanity, the well being of a rescued cat, and because the landlord’s son as a roommate is causing an unbalanced power dynamic.

**Entering Unit W/O 24-Hour Notice:**

Here are some texts from my property manager while we had an open bedroom, not my landlord who I still have never spoken to. I have text message records for all these.

\- June 17, 2019 (9:20 AM):  
“I have a guy that want to view at \[2:00PM\] is that okay with you?”

\- June 20, 2019 (1:30 PM):

“I have a showing at \[4:00PM\] today.”

\- June 25, 2019 (12:02 PM)

“I’ll have a showing at \[3:00PM\] and \[4:00PM\] today”

\- June 29, 2019 (5:10 PM)

“If I can schedule a showing for \[6:30PM\] tonight that would work

\- July 15, 2019 (9:47 AM)

“I will have tours today at \[4:00PM\], \[4:15PM\], \[4:30PM\]”

\- July 29, 2019 (12:09 PM)

“I have some showings at \[4:45PM\]”

**Rent Raising Above 2.2%:**

\- At the beginning of June 2019, 1 bedroom was available for rent and one was unoccupied by a non-returning tenant spending their summer elsewhere. I had only intentions to rent the unoccupied room as it was larger. The property manager told me I could move in ASAP and live in the available small bedroom until the other tenant moved his stuff out, then simply transfer my stuff into the bedroom I intended on renting. The price I signed this lease for was $750 (Not including utilities or parking). June 29th, 2019, my property manager texted me, “I guess I had things mixed up, I thought you would be able to move into the back room, he said he wants it rented for $850, due to the size.” Then proceeded to say I can keep the room I was waiting in for the same price or pay more to upgrade, even though I signed the lease with the agreement to move into the larger room. The property manager then told me he could try to rent out the small room for $850 to the next tenant, so I could have the larger room for the agreed upon price. He told me couldn’t find anyone, so we came to an agreement of $800 for the new room (still not including parking or utilities). Later I find out that the tenant in the small room that I was paying $750 for is paying $850, but I’m still paying $800. The increase put on his room was done during August as was mine (3 months into my lease, beginning of his).

\- I have text message records as well as lease agreements for all this.

**Failure to Provide Mail Key:**

\- My first day moving into the apartment, my (at the time) one roommate (also the landlord and owner’s son) lost the mail key. I instructed him to find the replacement or search for the lost one. After months of waiting, I took the issue into my own hand and contacted the property manager. He claimed I needed to call Canada Post. I called Canada Post and they said It’s up to my property manager, who when contacted again brought they key over promptly. The roommate who lost the key then found it in his pants he wore the day he lost it (3 months later). This ended up costing me money to reship parcels that the post office returned due to lengthy overstay.

**The Cat:**

\- The relationship between my two apartment mates was above average the first week of October. My roommate (the landlord’s son) and his girlfriend returned from the SPCA (Animal shelter) all excited about how great cats are. Under all of our agreement, we decided to go adopt a cat for the apartment, as the landlord’s son had stated many times his father (and our lease…) would be okay with it. We all went to the SPCA and paid for the cat together after I signed as the legal owner. One week after having the cat, my roommate returns saying his dad doesn’t want the cat in his unit, so it has to go. After some lengthy debates, I asked him to get his dad to provide a legal reason for the cat not being here and he said, “There is no legal reason, he just doesn’t want it. But we could make up that I have allergies or something.” Let me clarify by saying the cat is 12, extremely docile, doesn’t destroy anything, and is only cared for by me. His father, the landlord and owner, has not even made an appearance since I moved in June. So now it’s just me searching for a proper home (or waiting out until I can move out and keep him), while the other two roommates do nothing but say the cat has to go.

**Other:**

\- My roommate (landlord’s son), lets his girlfriend park in an illegal zone next to a fire hydrant but will get other’s towed for being in that spot.

\- The property manager told me about an issue of our garbage cans being next to a window of another building that they own but told me jokingly he didn’t really care, and he’d move them eventually.

\- We have a full-sized propane barbecue on our 3-story fire-escape?

My Town is trying to screw me over on some dirt fill I placed on my land 1.5 years ago. They ordered a survey company onto my land without telling me (I refused).,158,dp8kfp,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dp8kfp/my_town_is_trying_to_screw_me_over_on_some_dirt/,15,1572479307.0,"***Backstory:***

**Spring of 2018:** I had some dirt filled into a low spot / large hole in the corner of my yard (over the course of 1-2 weeks). Neighbors complained about the trucks coming in so the town health officer stopped by and took pictures.

**July 2018:** I receive a letter from the zoning officer:

>... Please be aware that , per the Zoning Regulations of the town of xxx, a permit is required for earth moving in a quantity in excess of 100 cubic yards of material. As no permit has been issued for earth moving on your property, you are now in violation of that provision of the regulations....

I went to town hall to speak with her and she agreed to come look at my property. She was convinced the fill was more than 100 yds (I didn't confirm or deny) and she told me I needed to appear before the zoning commission to apply for a permit. She also became concerned that our fill had crossed the property line to my neighbors land (these neighbors had not complained, or even been aware that we did any work). I approached my neighbors (who i hadn't met before) asking to sign a letter saying they did not have any concerns about dirt placed over the property line (this section of land is far behind their house, over a hill, and they have never even visited it). Sadly, they replied they would not sign without seeing a survey.

**Oct 2018:** At this point I saw the mess ahead of me so I e-mailed the zoning officer stating this:

>Hello ZO,  
>  
>I spoke to the contractor who handled our fill and leveling this spring and he told me that he brought in less than 100 yds of dirt. If I’m reading the zoning regulations right that should mean that our project didn’t require a permit, correct? What is the resolution for the neighbors complaint about trucks and work performed on Sundays? Please let me know what is needed. Am I able to submit a permit application for a shed at this point?  
>  
>Thanks,foolishfool

**Jan 2019:** I received a letter from the ZO:

>... I have recently heard from a couple of your neighbors. One of your neighbors, who has worked in construction, challenged your contractor's statement, noting the number of trucks he observed entering your property last summer. Another neighbor contacted me with concern that the material brought on to your property encroaches upon their property.  
>  
>Given your neighhbor's statements and concerns, additional information is required in order to resolve this issue. The town is, therefore, requesting that you provide a survey of the work area that will determine the amount of fill added and also the proximity to Property lines...

**Jul 2019:** I had contacted the surveyor to discuss the letter. He stated there is no way to gauge how much fill was put down, or where it was put down without a prior topographic map. I then emailed the zoning officer this:

>I have spoken to the surveyor from xxx twice and shared the contents of your letter. He says that without a prior topographic map of the property it is not possible to do a survey that would accomplish the goals of showing how much fill was placed and where. I have built a view of the fill project location on the most recent survey (attached). I did not mark the area that was cleared and re-seeded. Please let me know if you need anything further.

**Oct 2019:** Well today the surveyor showed up at my house with a work order to stake my property line with the zoning officer's name as the one who ordered it. He said the town was paying for it but I'm sure they would make me pay once they decide they think I'm in the wrong - so I refused and they left.

***Questions:***

1. Can the town legally order a survey on my land?

Should I allow them to stake my property line? If it shows the ""unnatural"" slope at the edge of my yard is on the line, how can they prove it was from the fill I added, not what was added before I moved in? the pictures showing dirt only prove i cleared in that spot and seeded...

2) Isn't the property line issue a civil dispute? Should I tell the town to butt out? Should I ask for the neighbors to order the survey from their side?

3) I need this resolved in order to apply to build a shed - can I (or should I) sue the town?

4) How screwed am I?

Thanks!!

 The following Tuesday my pain levels started to get drastically worse to the point where I could barely stand up even with crutches and when I told the doctor during my follow up appointment that day he kind of just disregarded what I said and rushed me out the door. The paperwork I received stated I was ready to return to work with no restrictions which was completely false. 


The next day after informing my supervisors that I was still unable to return to work I got a call from my works HR department saying that I need to return because the doctor had released me and they threatened me with termination if I didn’t show up. So I called the clinic to try and explain to them I was in unbearable pain and that I needed more time off work, all they did was give me a new sheet saying I could return to work with restrictions of standing for a max of 2 hours. Keep in mind at this point even sitting down was unbearable for me. They wouldn’t listen to anything I said and told me this was all they could do because of the way workers comp works. 

Later that day I forced myself to show up to work and all I did was sit down in the office for 2 hours doing nothing while my pain kept getting worse and worse. My boss told me to go home and that he would try to sort it out with HR, but I never got a follow up from him. 


Later that night I was running a fever of 100.4 and the pain was so unbearable I decided to check into the ER where they did a CT scan and determined that I had muscle breakdown and was unfit to bear any weight on the injured leg. They also told me that if I left it untreated my condition could have led to possible kidney failure and compartment syndrome. 

I’m considering contacting an attorney because to me it seems like negligence for the doctor I saw to try and send me back to work without listening to my symptoms or directing me to have more tests done. It also doesn’t seem right for my job to threaten termination despite my being unfit to work. My job is saying workers comp will cover my medical costs but that hasn’t been sorted out yet since I’m still in the hospital and they haven’t said anything about if it will cover my lost hours. They also said that they “didn’t threaten me with anything” which is untrue and told me that they want to make sure I’m fully healed before returning to work despite them telling me I needed to return or face termination in the previous phone call. 

What would be the best course of action here? Should I contact a lawyer?

My dog ate a squeaker that got stuck in his system. Doggie Day Care said they don't allow toys but they do. Can they be held  responsible?

<backstory>

My dog, is in ICU and almost died because he had a toy squeaker lodged in his GI system. 

For this exact reason, I don't do squeaker toys in my house bc they are dangerous to dogs (and my dog doesn't have self control).

2 weeks prior he came home from a visit to doggie day care and pooped out a squeaker. I called the daycare to find out if he got into a basket of toys etc.

They said ""No, absolutely not ""we do not allow toys"". It is against our policies.

I said thank you and asked them to note his records for no squeaky toys.

1 week later he is vomiting and very sick and goes to the emergency room. Emergency surgery revealed a second squeaker that got lodged in his intestines, tore a hole in his bowels and he was septic. He has had intensive care and monitoring for the past 4 days.

Today, in the day care private FB group, a video is posted in which a dog is playing with a squeaky toy at their facility.

I feel hurt, lied to, angry, and dumbstruck. I want to go full Karen. Does this warrant legal action? 

To CYA I went through their FB and took screen recordings.

Any advice would be helpful. I am exhausted and I want my dog to live. I don't have the bandwidth to consider next steps. Can you offer advice?",2

I was promoted to a management position in July which changed my status from being an hourly employee to a salaried employee and was moved to a brand new location for this franchise. 

I am currently the only employee for the owner and work 10hr days (except sunday, 8hrs) 7 days a week and havent had a day off in what feels like forever. I'm basically running an entire business myself and the owner will occasionally pop in or call to see how things are going. I do all the banking, I pick up and create all of the orders for the store, make sure all the numbers and inventory is lined up and essentially I run his business for him. 

I am being paid a salary of $3,500/mo. I take no breaks, unless its to use the restroom but I constantly eat on the clock and have to help customers once they come in disrupting my so called ""lunch"". I also do have an incentive for 25% profit share but have yet to see any of that because this is still a brand new business in its infancy and we are currently still in the Red.

Before I became a manager there were times where I worked 11 day work weeks then got split days off. So I feel that the owner knows how hard working and committed I can be and now is completely taking advantage of my workaholic nature. 
He has told me multiple times how we dont need another employee yet because of how slow business is and how the 25% profit share will be less for me because of having to have payroll. 

I guess I'm exhausted and tired being taken advantage of and getting no breaks or time for myself. My mental health has deteriorated and my will to do anything has as well.. I've gained weight and have lost so much sleep stressing for this business that's not even mine. 

My question is what steps should I take to try to fix this all or should I immediately seek Legal Help? Or is this all legal because of some loopholes? I have no clue what to do and finding a job that can pay as much is next to impossible..

"[Maine] Housemate that moved in 2 months ago is in the hospital, three dogs are left in my house and will not stop barking.

I own the house I live in, and recently my stepfather's brother moved into the downstairs with his three dogs. I don't mind him living here since it's a fully finished downstairs that I don't use, and we never see each other.

About a week or two ago, the brother had an incident where he drank too much, injured himself, and now he's in the hospital for at least another week or two while he detoxes or whatever. His three dogs are still here, and without him there, they never shut the hell up.

If I make a move, if I take a step, if my cat meows outside, one dog starts howling and barking, which gets another dog howling and barking, and they will not listen to me. Nothing I do will make them silent. I have to stay in my bedroom with the door shut and my headset on to try and drown out the noise. If I sit down to play a game, those dogs will bark constantly, without stopping, for upwards of four hours.

The guy's son visits a few times a week and they are mostly okay, however if he's not here, they're impossible to deal with. I can't even cook in my kitchen without them howling and making the worst noises known to man.

The first few nights he was in the hospital, they managed to break through the gate downstairs and tried to break through my gate upstairs to get at my cat (the owner has admitted in the past that one of his biggest concerns is one specific dog getting at the cat, because he's sure it'll kill her). I'm used to dogs, but I would not touch the dog that was trying to get through the gate because it was flashing its teeth at me and would not calm down.

The son tried to help because he understands that this is really infuriating and unacceptable, but he ""can't really do anything about it"". He doesn't have a home to take them to, he doesn't have other relatives to take them to, and when he tried to lock them in the bedroom downstairs overnight, they destroyed the door so now there's a massive 2x2 foot hole in it (that they will be replacing, they are very aware of this).

I can't function in my own home because of these god damned dogs. I don't know if they're considered abandoned. Tonight I decided to make dinner and they barked and howled the entire 2 hours that I was in my kitchen. Everything about this situation is infuriating me, until I told his son that if nothing was done by this weekend, I'd take them to the shelter myself because they're not my dogs and this shouldn't be my problem  (I also told his son that I understand his hands are tied since they're not his dogs, but I'm over it and it's useless talking to the son at this point).

What the hell do I do at this point? What can I do? I'm sure taking them to the shelter would be illegal as hell since I'm not the owner, I'm really not a violent person, but I can't continue living with these fucking dogs barking for hours on end when I'm home and destroying my house when someone tries to deal with them.",0

After a dispute concerning unreasonable expectations (demanding 60+ hour weeks with no additional compensation when 40 was agreed upon) I decided I would look elsewhere for work. 

One month later I was arrested at the DMV due to charges filed by previous employer (PE). PE stated to police that I had stolen $350 worth of tools (2 hammers, 2 tire irons) and that I had destroyed the interior of my work truck on my last day thus was charged with a class C misdemeanor (theft) and criminal mischief (state felony). This has decimated my ability to find quality work. 

The tools, which I did not steal, have no resale value nor use to me. 

The work truck’s interior was removed due to repairing the gear selector at the request of my PE, but was not completed due to disagreement. 

PE claimed the shifter was broken spitefully. However, the shifter in the 2002 Ford E350 is universally known to fail frequently due to poor design. The shifter was the original to the truck which has 325,000 miles.  

Additionally, PE refused to pay my last two checks ($1,600 total) but stated on my I-9 tax form that I was paid the monies.

Scenario: Part time hourly employee. Worked set days, Mon & Sat. (5) hours each day. Transferred to a new store location in another district and was told by new manager to start work and clocking in will be dealt with later. 3 days worth of work and still didn't get paid on the next paycheck.

Over last several weeks after verifying with company HR team over phone. Said days were not paid. Made an attempt to try and open support ticket for payroll and HR to get three days paid. They said, given that I didn't clock in they wouldn't pay me. Albeit I was working and visible on internal security cameras working. Escalated issue again to HR corporate and they said that they need to do an investigation to verify after having multiple calls and given the runaround. Was told by person from Corporate HR overseeing issue that an actual ticket/case would not be generated until at least Monday 11/4/19. Said individual also told me given the nature of the issue, I should not have even been working yet due to them not properly transferring me, even though I was told by the new manager to start work. 

Unpaid days due to site transfer was 9/16, 9/21/ & 9/23. System would not let me clock in. 

Question: Due to them not paying me in a timely matter, does this qualify under good faith or would they be subject to wait time penalties given the failure to provide the necessary pay. Even after verify with multiple attempts to verify that transfer was to be sent in.

How do I go about seeking legal help if I feel that my daughter's disabilities were cause by contradictory information on a medication information leaflet?,27,dpg783,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dpg783/how_do_i_go_about_seeking_legal_help_if_i_feel/,25,1572512912.0,"I am seeking medical legal advice. This all took place in California. 

In August 2016 I started taking orthotricyclin lo. In November 2016 I started to suspect that I might be pregnant due to some bodily changes that I had never experience before. My nipples had become darker and painfully tender. I had developed some food adversions and nausea.

It would have been too early to take a test at that time so I had to debate if I should stop taking my birth control and risk actually becoming pregnant or if I should continue to take the birth control.

I went to get the information I had recieved with the birth control and when I read it it said ""There is little or no increased risk of birth defects in women who inadvertently use COCs during early pregnancy. Epidemiologic studies and meta-analyses have not found an increased risk of genital or non-genital birth defects (including cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects) following exposure to low dose COCs prior to conception or during early pregnancy.""

So I trusted it and continued to take my birth control until I would be able to take a pregnancy test.

Then my daughter was unexpectedly born with missing limbs. The reason I didnt know is a whole other story but long story short, I was never contacted by the doctor in regards to my daughters disabilities. It could have been a very ugly situation since I was not able to inform the delivering doctor of what was to come since I myself had no clue that my daughter was about to be born missing good amounts of 3/4 of her limbs. As many doctors know, since the heart lungs kidneys and limbs all develop around the same time, there could have been fatal consequences to not knowing that information and being able to share it with my doctor but thankfully all problems with her heart and kidneys resolved.

Immediately after birth I was tested for drugs and so was my daughter placenta and urine. All came up clear and I have my medical record for that as proof. I had never taken anything except for the damn birth control in the first few weeks. I hadn't even taken a tylenol ever and I found out I was pregnant very early.

My daughter had a genetic sequencing right away and she had no genetic links. All the specialists that spoke with me also told em it was not amniotic band syndrome.

I firmly believe the birth control was the cause since there is no family history of this in my family and not in her father's family either.

I had felt this was all out of my hands legally until I found this today. I feel that this directly contradicts what they said about using orthotricyclin lo while pregnant. I trusted what they said in the information leaflet that came with the pills. But if this was also stated, I would NOT have taken the pills at all!

>[US FDA pregnancy category X: Studies in animals or humans have demonstrated fetal abnormalities and/or there is positive evidence of human fetal risk based on adverse reaction data from investigational or marketing experience, and the risks involved in use of the drug in pregnant women clearly outweigh potential benefits.](https://www.drugs.com/pregnancy/ethinyl-estradiol-norgestimate.html)

I am wondering what are my legal options?

How do I contact a lawyer if I there are legal options for me?

How should I go about finding other possible victims?

What other proof would I need besides the genetics sequencing?

I'm sorry for the lengthy post I felt back story was important.

Edit: I probably should have said I suspected that I was pregnant because I really would not have taken it if I actually had a reasonable suspicion. There is a less than 1% chance of becoming pregnant on birth control. My period was due in a few days so I had chalked it up to pre menstrual symptoms.

I should have more said that I had a fleeting thought that I could have been pregnant because I had never experience nipple tenderness as a pre menstrual symptom before. But the booklet also saud breast tenderness was a side effect. So I thought. With a < 1% chance of actually being pregnant I think there more chance that I'm experiencing premens symptoms and/or side effects of the pill.

I did NOT take the pill while KNOWING I was pregnant. I did read the whole pamphlet and the statement that said ""poses little or no risk if taken inadvertently while pregnant"" is what put my mind at ease for my little, probably-not-there baby. I didnt want a baby but I did want to take care of one if it was there. So I just wanted to stress that if I actually thought I was pregnant I would have stopped the pill immediately.

So yeah I do feel that I did take the pill inadvertently while pregnant. And I only took it for about 4 more days until my period would have been missed.

But in the end, my main goal was 1. finding out how to approach lawyers because I'd think that hiring one for something like this would be extremely expensive but I also remember my mom had hired a medical malpractice lawyer back in 2012 and he took 30% of her initial settlement instead of charging her for his services up front. And then took a small percent of her monthly winnings.

And 2. Going about finding other victims and/or finding a link. I figured that lawyers or people familiar with the process would know how it's usually done so I could actually find proof other than my own suspicions.

I started working as a k12's IT Tech this year. Everything was going well until Pennsylvania state reporting reared it's ugly head. I've never worked in a k12 before and the school in general is a mess. Naturally, as most places, responsibility falls to the new IT puppet. And naturally, as the new IT puppet, I'm eager to dive in... Non-technical things are getting screwed up left and right. Reporting, some projects, and yes of course I'm not perfect either.

Overall everything has been a team effort with the school and I thought we were all on the same page with what had to be done. But now, all of a sudden the whole tone of the school changed...like somebody just suddenly flipped a lightswitch. Everybody is just suddenly either pissed off or very cold with me. I have nowhere to go to talk with anybody there and I'm really, really fucking worried here. It just seems like I'm getting setup to be the one to get pegged for whatever could be coming...

I feel like people are trying to pull words out of my mouth, people are outright lying about direct questions, everybody seems to be targeting me. I feel like I'm living through something straight out of the fucking Wicker Man at this point...I'm not even nervous about losing my job...I'm super fucking nervous about what/if there are things in PA public schools where I could be held personally liable for.

I don't know what the fuck is going on but it's freaked me out enough to do all this. I'm at the point where I'm considering seeing if wearing a wire would be legal to do. Any advice, reading material, sources, anything at all would be greatly appreciated.",0
Hottub company messed up repair.,1,dprya7,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dprya7/hottub_company_messed_up_repair/,0,1572576429.0,"This is in Minnesota. The repair company is from south Dakota. 

I moved to a new house at the end of April. My old place had a hottub that we had moved with us. We hired the company let's call them XYZ to move the hottub and look at why the lights inside the tub did not work anymore. While at the old place the movers looked at the lights and thought it was a bad part and thought the part maybe died from some lights that were cracked. The movers at that time then tried (using the wrong tool they told me) to remove some of the ""damaged"" lights making them much harder to replace. After failing to remove 3 or 4 lights the movers loaded the tub up and we got the tub to the new place. 

The new place did not have a spot to put the tub right away so we stored the tub in a shed until a spot was made. Fast forward to September. We have the tub moved into place and electricity hooked up. Now we send for XYZ to come fix the lights. At this point the tub is empty and has not had water in the tub but still in the lines. XYZs tech ""fixes"" the lights and shows that while empty the lights work. (Not actual working conditions for a hottub).

2 days later we noticed water by the tub. I look and a pump has a bad seal. I call XYZ again they come fix the pump. This takes 2 weeks to come back for this fix. The pump only leaked when running and I had noticed we still had wet ground days after pump fix. I start tracking the water levels and notice we are losing a lot. I also notice the lights are not working. I let XYZ know again, and eventually (about 2 weeks later) XYZ comes and ""fixes"" the leak. XYZ does nothing for the lights. I call again and talk to the service manager who says something along the lines of we will not fix the lights cause we do not want to be responsible for any damage the water caused. The manager also said he emailed me with the work notes. 

We ended the call and I read the notes the next day I called again this time talking to someone else tell them what I was told they get confused and look into the situation more. 2 weeks later this person finally gets back to me. Says they know the issue and how to fix it now and will be sending someone to fix the issue. 

Last night I noticed we are again losing water fast again so I call today to get XYZ to send a tech sooner rather than later. Now the person on the phone informs me that they might need payment before they will allow the service to happen. I had 2 bills 1 for the lights and 1 for the pump. I informed XYZ that I would pay for the pump cause that fix is working but not the lights until they are actually working. 

A note also we had the tub in the old location for 3+ years and never noticed a water level reduction. They water would evaporate slowly or splash out if to many people were in at once but never leaking out.

I am wondering what is stopping then from charging my card for all the bills we have without my permission? 

If they do charge for all the bills can I charge back that amount? 

Finally a little more technical. For the last 4 weeks or so we have had water running into the electrical systems of our tub. What are my options if my tub had been damaged beyond repair? Can I go after XYZ for a new tub?",1

I am a renter in Philadelphia paying $930 a month to my landlord for rent. It's cheaper than NYC but its still a lot, and the cost of living here can be fairly high.

My landlord calls himself ""old school"" and only accepts paper checks and cashier's checks. It's annoying and seems like a waste of time/money so I'm trying to get him to accept Venmo or Cashapp payments, which work just as well and save me time/money/ urgency.

Regardless, I want to know what my legal standing is on who should have to foot the bill on the FedEx payments, the cashier's checks, etc. Shipping them via fedex usually costs me close to $20/$30 every time, plus the $10 it costs to get a cashier's check from my bank. I'm in a year long lease in a studio apartment by myself so every penny counts for me, I really want to be able to afford occasionally seeing a friend for drinks, in the city it's the easiest way to hang out with a friend and the extra $40 every month would be great to have for just such happiest of hours.

I'm a tenant whose car was damaged by disrepair in a common area,1,dprput,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dprput/im_a_tenant_whose_car_was_damaged_by_disrepair_in/,0,1572575423.0,"Happy Halloween, Reddit!

Greetings from the state of California.

I was driving into my apartment's parking garage when a piece of the grating on the floor of the garage scraped off a piece of the undercarriage of my car causing it to not be drivable, requiring a tow and a replacement of a plastic piece underneath my car.

I had the damage repaired and then subsequently attempted to receive reimbursement from my landlord for the repairs (it is a small amount) but was told that the lardlord does not accept any liability for conditions of the property and that my lease contains a clause releasing them from liability.

I re-read my lease, and indeed the lease does contain an addendum that seemingly absolves them for all responsibility for damages even when the property is in disrepair.

I have the following questions:

1. What is the likelihood that such a clause would hold up in small claims court? I know that boilerplate legal agreements often include broadly scoped clauses that are thrown out in court, and I was wondering what rights in this area (if any) I cannot have signed away by agreeing to the lease.
2. What recourse (if any) do I have for being reimbursed for the damages caused to my car?
3. What protections do I have should I make public demonstrations and / or contact the media to expose the actions of my apartment complex? I am considering dispersing leaflets and having a demonstration on the public sidewalk opposite the apartment complex entrance.
4. Is there a way to use this incident as grounds for early lease termination? I would prefer to just leave the property and live elsewhere, but we are not very far into our lease term and it has a relatively expensive buy-out clause.",1

They also sell some clothing such as robes, slippers and other luxury items. A while back, the spa began offering many of the same items sold in my mom's shop like the jewelry, sweaters and pants, accessories, etc.  


I have not personally seen the lease, but my mom tells me there is an exclusivity clause that essentially states no other business in the strip mall is allowed to sell specific items. The landlord, my mom and the spa owner set up a meeting. It took months for the spa owner to find the time to attend the meeting because of ""scheduling conflicts"", but they finally sat down and talked it out. Afterward, the landlord assured my mom he would have a further discussion with the spa to sort it out. He told her that in July. It is now nearly November.  


Is there anything else my mom can do to remedy this? I suggested withholding rent until the rule is truly enforced because she is not getting the business exclusivity promised in the lease. She seemed very hesitant at that idea because she is concerned it will cost more to enforce the rule than the cost whatever business the spa is stealing. She also did not want to sue the spa personally due to lawyer costs.

""*For the purpose of work jurisdiction, the ""Employer A"" and the Union agree that ""Employer B"" is a separate and unique employer from ""Employer A*"".  *The work of ""Employer B"" is the sole jurisdiction of ""Employer B*"".

I've been required to work for ""Employer B"".  Attempts to mitigate the situation have been unsuccessful and despite my employment contract with Employer A, I am still required to do the work of Employer B which is grossly different.

Questions:

1. Based on these being separate legal entities and the wording of the collective agreement (which is part of my employment contract with Employer A) would this be viewed as a material change to the employment contract? 
2. As an employee of Employer A, do I have signing authority for it's separate legal entity: Employer B?
3. If I don't have signing authority for Employer B, what affect would it have on the 30 important contracts I signed binding Employer B to something?

I have tried to do some research but I keep getting the run around from everyone (government offices/courts) I call - I'd like some advice from this forum first before I call a lawyer (as money is tight). I will do my best to lay out everything; I do best in pointform......

My Grandma passed away in March 2019. Her next of kin is alive (her son - my father).My Grandma's savings were dwindled away in her last years of life to pay for her son to live in her condo and to pay for her retirement home. Unfortunately her savings ran out and some of her accounts have gone into arrears. Her Son continues to live in the condo despite this now being owned by her ""estate""....

I feel like I've covered everything below and my questions are listed at the end. Any help is appreciated! I'm very overwhelmed - this is the first death I've had to deal with in this sense......

***THE SITUATION***

**THE WILL**

* a signed copy was first thought to have not existed (thus apparently making it void?), Her Son was going to look into how to file/contest so he can claim her estate - he has not done so, he will never do so.
* A signed copy does exist (I have it), and it lists two executors
* Unsure if signed copy is the original - *does this hinder things in anyway?*
* The lawyer who drafted the will is no longer practicing
* The executors are **NOT** myself or Her Son
* The executors are family friends who want **absolutely NOTHING** to do with the Will, with Her Son (Her Son is a very abusive person - think Frank from Shameless) they want to give up their rights. They are claiming old age and one is also in a retirement home
* The Will lists three heirs; myself, Her Son and one Second Cousin
* The Will stipulates that the Condo **MUST** be given to ""her estate"" to be sold to cover any outstanding bills/debt (of which exists); she does not own any other property or have any other savings. Her condo is the only thing of monetary value
* The left over money would be divided as such: $10,000 each to myself, Her Son, Second cousin immediately
* The leftover money from the above would then be put into a trust (which an executor would oversee) that is to give Her Son $1000 a month for the rest of his life or until the money runs out. If he passes away prior to the money running out I then inherit the remaining amount in full
* It also states that her ashes are to be spread out in her homeland of Croatia
* The Condo is owned outright btw

**HER SON**

* he has ruined the condo beyond standard repair
* he refuses to vacate the premises so it can be fixed up and sold
* he will not discuss anything in person with me
* he will not talk to the executors
* the condo has issued numerous letters against him for numerous smoking violations amongst other things
* the condo has threatened to put several liens on the unit as he is constantly late with Condo Fee Payments (less than $700/month)

***MY QUESTIONS***

* What are my first steps to file this Will?
* I believe I need my grandmothers death certificate - how do I apply for this?
* What kind of lawyer should I be looking for?
* What kind of court system does this fall under? Criminal? Family?
* How do I remove the executors from the Will?
* How do I remove/evict Her Son from the Condo so the estate can sell it?
* How long do I have until the government finds out my father is committing identity fraud by still living in the condo under his deceased mothers name for going on half a year (he is not paying off any bills and has had the condo payments go into arrears more than once)
* Am I able to petition the Estate/Will to fully/partially fund the trip to Croatia to spread her ashes?
* What if Her Son refuses to release her ashes?
* Edited to Add - Her Son does not have a passport and refuses to fly which is how I know he will not go to Croatia to fulfill her wishes 

Please let me know if you need more information or if you feel I have missed anything vital. Will do my best to edit and reply as much as I can!",1

I’m a in the process of trying to buy my families first house. And we qualify and should get approved for the loan. However there’s a small hitch. Seems I misread or misunderstood the contract that is in my lease agreement.

It requires at least 30 days notice and a buy out of fee of the lease equal to 2 months of rent or the remaining amount of the lease. While that seems preposterous. 

There is a sublease clause and a smoking addendum. So the only way it seems out of this to fork out 4 months of rent which is not.... affordable.

The only relief I can see is that the smoking addendum does not allow for smoking in the apartment the connected building areas or the common areas, but my porch keeps getting cigarette ash on it, from my upstairs neighbor I’ve informed the office multiple times and it keeps happening. Additionally the upstairs noisy run their dogs in the late hours of the night causing quite a lot of noise.

I was very shaken up because my mom had never physically hurt me intentionally before, I basically went into shock, and left the house to go to my friends house without her permission so I could get away from the house. 

I guess for some stupid reason I was expecting an apology when I got home but instead my mom was back to screaming at me. She told me that I had to go pack my bags because I wasn't welcome in the house anymore. I didn't want to argue because I was afraid she would hurt me again, so i just waited for my dad to get home.

But while I was doing my chores, I was listening to music and had my headphones in, I had a lot of work to do for school so I wanted to hurry and get it done with. But my mom kept adding chores to my list because I had done something earlier that morning that annoyed her.

 So I said ""Mom!"" but it came out a lot louder than expected because of my headphones.

I knew I had messed up so I apologized right away. 

As you can imagine, she was furious that I had yelled at her. She told my friends that I couldn't go to the halloween dinner anymore, and then she began going INSANE 

she put a burning hot pan that was full of grease in my bed, she threw all my stuff in the basement and said that I had to sleep there until they found another place for me to live. 

I've been clinically diagnosed with a severe case of anxiety and depression, and my doctor told me that one of the triggers for this is toxic parents. 

Are my parents abusive? If so what should I do?

An offleash dog got into a fight with my leashed dogs,1,dprds5,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dprds5/an_offleash_dog_got_into_a_fight_with_my_leashed/,2,1572574012.0,"My wife was walking our dogs (large shepherd mixes) on leashes and harnesses in the middle of a public street. A smaller mutt type dog ran out of a backyard (no leash) and got into a fight with our dogs. It took my wife a while to pull them off each other, and one of my dogs ended up with some small bite wounds but the other person's dog ended up with some deep large lacerations and will probably need expensive vet care. 

The other dog's owner eventually came outside and brought her dog inside. She wanted to know if we were going to pay for vet bills. I pointed out that our dogs were on a leash, but I offered to exchange information and helped her bandage up her dog with a first aid kit. We swapped phone numbers, and that was that, she left and we left. We haven't heard anything since. 

What should I do next? I feel sorry for the other dog owner, but it was her leaving her dog unleashed that caused this event and I don't feel I should pay large vet bills. There is a leash law in my county.

I photo documented my dog's injuries and called for legal advice through my work provided legal insurance but haven't heard back yet.

Probate in NJ?,1,dprdec,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dprdec/probate_in_nj/,2,1572573967.0,"Location: NJ 

My father died without a will. Most of his assets were held jointly with my mom or were designated POD, but he had one bank account that was just him, and both family cars (one paid off, one leased) are under just his name. I called the surrogacy court and they said to bring proof of assets and that we would have to pay a probate fee to get things transferred over to my mom. 

So, a few questions:

Do his IRA, joint accounts with my mom, and POD accounts need to go through probate?

Is there anything else that we should come prepared with or should know other than the proof of assets and death certificate? She said my mom didn’t need to bring her marriage license, which seems strange to me.

Lost small claims court trying to get insurance id of driver who hit me - anything I can do?,1,dprdas,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dprdas/lost_small_claims_court_trying_to_get_insurance/,2,1572573954.0,"About 9 months ago, I was hit by a driver while riding my bicycle. I was very nervous and perhaps a bit dazed, and did not think to call the police. Since my bike was wrecked, the driver offered to take to me to a bike shop and repair it. Again, due to my mental state, I agreed. I understand that I am supposed to call the police and exchange information, but I was not thinking clearly. 2 hours later, on the advice of family, I went to the hospital to get checked out. Luckily, I was not seriously injured, but I was in pain for a few weeks. On the way, I texted the driver asking for his insurance information. They responded that they needed to find it.

For the next few months, I continually asked the driver for the insurance information, as I began receiving bills for the trip to the hospital. Each time they had a new excuse as to why they were too busy to send me the number- various deaths in the family, work obligations, etc. I was very polite, as having a sick or dying relative is a horrible experience and I wanted to give them time. They ended up blocking my phone number. I eventually got the police involved and were given the same excuses. At this point, the refusal to give the insurance information became very suspicious, so I offered to accept a check in place of the information. The police relayed this message, the driver apparently accepted, and we were put into contact via email. At this point, the police washed their hands of the situation. I emailed the driver, who changed their story, saying that I never asked for the insurance information (forgetting that I have texts proving otherwise) and that I am trying to scam them. They even became very sanctimonious, saying that my bad character won't deter them from being kind in the future because they were raised well in a religious family.

Fast forward to now. I took the driver to small claims court to sue for the medical bills. I brought in everything I could, including:

* highlighted/annotated text messages with the driver, in which I ask multiple times for the insurance info and they tell me excuses. They also texted me a photo of the receipt for paying for the damages to my bike.
* emails with the police concerning this matter
* emails with the driver in which they ask for my address to send me the information and then shortly after claim I  never asked for the information.
* medical documentation and bills
* an annotated google maps print out

The defendant, however, only had three pieces of evidence:

* a picture of the receipt of them paying for my bike
* an MS-Paint drawn map, which depicts them driving the wrong way down a one-way street.
* a picture of their deceased relative

Additionally, in court that day, the driver said that I caused around $700 worth of damage to the car (about the same amount I was suing for). This was the first time they mentioned this fact, despite having 9 months of texting, emailing and talking with the police on the topic of car accidents, bills and insurance. They did not, however, have the bill. The judge said that we could submit additional evidence for the next week. I had already submit all of mine, so I just sent a personal statement, highlighting all of the flaws in the drivers arguments/evidence.

I was sure that based upon the conduct of the driver over the last year and their lacking evidence that this would be a simple case, but I just found out that I lost. This is infuriating, because the evidence the defendant offered was a fake map of them driving dangerously/breaking a traffic law, a picture of them paying for my bike (which is an odd thing to do if I damaged their car) and apparently some evidence entered after the fact, which I could not see or defend against. Is that last part even legal? It seems unfair. As a plaintiff, I cannot appeal the case. However, I can file a motion to vacate. Is this worth it? Can I re-litigate the case? What can I do? This whole situation has been incredibly demoralizing.",1

This tree has been a problem even before this event had occurred, as it sheds various branches, spewing its limbs through my property and near my drive way.

I have asked the tenants, who live next to me, about this tree and they mentioned telling their landlord. They went on to indicate the landlord had mentioned having his son remove the tree, but that obviously never happened.

I reported the tree to my city, but they were not able to force the trees removal, and they could only have the branches and limbs removed from our yards.

After the incident occurred and I spoke with the landlord he was apologetic and filled a claim with his insurance, although they denied the claim as this was considered it “an act of god”.

He did remove the tree branch from my driveway, and in a text message he cited that it is not my responsibility to do so (although from my understanding I believe it actually is).

My insurance has considered the damage done to my vehicle as being a total loss. Unfortunately I have had to pay my deductible, and for a rental vehicle expenses until I can peruse obtain a new vehicle.

What recourse do I have to recoup my loses if anything?

I do have pictures of the tree before and after this event, the tree has no leaves (does have vine growth) and I would ascertain a layman would state the tree is dead.",1

Is the civil statute of limitations tolled while a claim is pending?

Nitty gritty:

Ex wife had a claim for some property awarded to her in divorce, which she abandoned when she absconded with our kid. (We had joint custody, she was found criminally guilty) I kept the abandoned property.  

In response to my custody modification action she claimed I stole this property, and motioned for contempt.  After being found criminally guilty (for the parental kidnapping incident) she absconded again on probation, and did not appear at the final custody trial. When I won sole custody that judge remarked that her claim I had stolen the property had not been clearly plead, and remarked in the order that her complaint may be better handled as a criminal matter, or by re-filing with more specificity. 

I’m not concerned about criminal liability here since the police and prosecutors know the facts very well, and are not interested in prosecuting her claim. (Plus the statue of limitations has expired) I am confident that the clear evidence I have of the facts would make me prevail in a civil action as well (she did not satisfy her court-ordered obligations to pay the loan in my name secured by this property, and ignored my repeated written demands to pay the loan and take the property) 

It would seem that the civil statute of limitations (4 years) has also expired in GA, unless this was tolled during the pendency of her now-dismissed contempt complaint.

My fiance works at a design firm in Ontario, Canada. She has worked there for 2.5 years and started working for them when they were still working off their dining table. She is the only registered designer at the firm, and consequently the only way they could get many of their trade accounts.

They started watching her computer activitity at work, as well as cameras showing when she comes and leaves. Shes not the most on-time person(comes in 10-15 minutes late sometimes), but she constantly works through her lunches and stays late. The amount of unpaid overtime she does per year is crazy so it's petty they'd be worried about 10-15 minutes here and there. She's been so sacrificial in building their business for them.

Anyways, they found out that she was helping out a couple friends with their house (a nursery for their baby) and screen shotted room measurements and pricing that were stored on her personal i cloud account. They interrogated her and she refused to admit it because they would never been clients of the firm. They're young friends who don't have much and would never pay the 5k per room that this company often charges.

They claim it's a breach of trust and have now fired her with ""just cause"". The issue I have with this is, they knew about this a week before firing her, but had her sign their industry registration papers before letting her go the very next day. This is extremely important because without her, they have no registered designers on staff and will likely not be able to continue many of their trade accounts. Her signing their papers allows them to become registered. I believe this exhibits that they were fine with her behavior when they needed something from her, and once they got it, suddenly it was a big deal and grounds for firing.

They provided a 2.5 week severance with a confidenality clause about not saying anything whatsoever about this anyone whosoever.

This is all so shady and unfortunately we should have seen it coming.  

To give some context to all of this - they promoted her to senior designer in June 2018 with the verbal communication that they didn't see the position requiring overtime. After the first month, they had her averaging about 2 additional hours per day and began to guilt her for not coming in on weekends.

They have instructed her to lie to contractors previously, as well as clients. They exhibit a consistent behavior of screwing people over, including instances with those closest to them. They're opportunists and don't really use reason when there is a chance to get money out of someone. With that said, we're extremely concerned about signing anything in order to get her severance as they're the worst case scenario people that would come after us at the first opportunity.

Any suggestions? We don't want to be bound to not say anything when they're free to say what they want to people. It's a small community and reputation is very important!",0

So I bought a vehicle end of March 2019 (2014 model) from the main dealer for this make of car. 
The first week of May, the engine light came on. DPF issue. I took it in for repair as the car came with a 1 year warranty. 
The last week of May, the engine light came on again - I took it back in for repair. At this point I was told that to keep this car running I would have to drive it for 30 minutes a day on the motorway in 3rd gear. 
July, the light came on again, and again at the end of July. 
Then again in August, and finally the car died on the spot on the 9th of October. 

After the most recent issue I have refused to take the car back from the dealer. I have demanded a refund as I believe the car to be unfit for purpose as it has broken down or suffered an issue almost monthly. 

I also believe that the car wasn't sold as described as I was told 2 months after purchasing it that if not driven in a very specific manner on a daily basis the engine would seize. 

I am now considering taking this up with my solicitor.

So I did the usual, check with neighbors and all that stuff they would probably ask. No one has seen it. I called amazon and contacted their live chat on Friday to see what they can do. They said they would launch an investigation and email me by Wednesday the 30th. They didn’t email me, so I went back on live chat to see what was up. I got transferred about 4 times to other people, eventually with them telling me I need to file a police report. 

I called my local station, and they said it wasn’t worth their time, and it’s not my place to file the report. I contacted amazon and told them what the station told me, and they said they won’t do anything without a report.

What can I do? I’m down $800 and I really need a replacement or refund. Can anybody help me out on this? Any and all help is appreciated!

I live in Pittsburgh PA btw.",4

I'm from Europe and I started uni this year through a study abroad program in England. The program staff helped me out throughout the whole process, including finding an accommodation through a uni owned office.

Lectures started on the 16th of September but I only applied to uni around the 22rd and got my accommodation application accepted on the 24th.The contract lasts for 40 weeks and one day which, if had started on the day the contract was approved, would finish on the 1st of July of 2020. Instead, it shows that my leave date is the 20th of June, which would make it start counting on the 13th of September (which is way before I applied to it).

The first installment is due on the 15th of November, and it's value shows that I'll be paying for rent starting on the 13th of September at a rate of £125/week.I've been looking for other housing options as £500 a month for myself is a bit too much given the conditions I'm actually living in. (The room is not that good, the mattress is ruined/clearly old and they told me they can't do anything about it.)

I've found some cheaper places that I could rent with one of my best mates who also moved here for uni and is in the same situation as I am and would like to go for it but, when looking to cancel my contract (which I asked to be done after paying the first installment), I've been told that I'd have to find a suitable replacement student for my room before I can be released from my contract.This is nowhere written in the License to Occupy and can only be found by looking through the accommodation website on the FAQs.

When I asked the study abroad staff if something could be done to find a person (e.g. if they had someone trying to apply for clearance courses as I did.) they told me that ""I should try Facebook Groups"". We're halfway through the semester and I don't think anyone would want to move here now, as they would need to find someone to occupy their rooms and so on, if they're with the same accommodation office.

Is there something I can do to cancel this contract and/or does anyone have any advice on how to deal with the whole situation?

Thanks in advance.",0

Background: I currently run a small-ish service business in NY State. We have an ongoing project that we are working on now that requires some  pretty specific parts to complete. The customer tried to order the parts themselves but the seller only sells to businesses and wants everyone to be a ""certified installer."" We tried to go through the motions with them but they're asking for a resale certificate which we do not currenly have as we do not sell any goods.

Question: How much overhead is it to sign up for a Sales Tax certificate? I wouldn't mind doing it as we would be able to order items for other customers at a discount (we usually require them to provide materials) but I have no idea how this works? Are we going to be required to report every purchase/sale and keep track of all that. If so, it kind of makes the overhead not worth it.

My concern is that I signed some paperwork as the (co) legal guardian in the hospital with nothing but my name and number. All paperwork about billing or insurance my ex signed, as he would be handling that... But now I am getting phone calls and text messages about an outstanding bill from the hospital. Could this affect my credit or otherwise negatively impact me? When I spoke to my ex he said he was ""aware of the bill.""

WV Noise ordinance exclusions/restrictions?,1,dpq3pe,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dpq3pe/wv_noise_ordinance_exclusionsrestrictions/,19,1572568586.0,"So I live in an apartment complex, and we've been having an ongoing issue with our upstairs neighbor and their loud a\*\* dog. For months and months, this thing will barks CONSTANTLY for hours on end. I moved in in August and I honestly can't recall a time in which this dog didn't bark. Me and my roommate have both contacted our property manager several times (I myself have sent in about 4 complaints via email and at least 2 in person). Our lease states that if a specific pet gets more than 2 noise complaints, the animal must be removed. The last time we spoke with the landlord in person, he said that that was what was happening. For maybe a week it was quiet, but the barking has started again. I listened to that dog bark daily for months now, it is absolutely the same damn dog. I've sent in two more complaints, one Tuesday night actually, and all I've gotten is a ""it \*should\* be resolved."" I want an it WILL be resolved. Last night, the dog started barking again, so I contacted the police. We have a noise ordinance in our city which states ""No person shall make, continue or cause to be made or continued, any loud, unnecessary or unusual noise or any noise which either annoys, disturbs, injures or endangers the comfort, repose, health, peace or safety of others, within the City."" and ""...The following acts are declared to be loud, disturbing and unnecessary noises in violation of Section 527.03, but such enumeration shall not be deemed to be exclusive, namely:

* (a) Animals and Birds. The keeping of any animal or bird by causing frequent or long continued noise shall disturb the comfort or repose of any persons in the vicinity...""

The officer I spoke with told me that if the animal cannot be heard from the ""city street"" then theres nothing he can do but also contact the landlord. They live on the fifth floor so of course it can't be heard from the city street. Is this actually true? I have a BIL who is a cop in PA and he said he used to hate dealing with ordinances, so I feel as if the officer just didn't want to deal with this. I live well within the city limits, and the ordinance states nothing specific that excludes apartment buildings. I even tried looking up WV bills on noise to see if it stated anything about apartment buildings being an exception. I just don't see how, if I'm having an ongoing issue with a noise, and my landlord isn't doing squat about it, that I just have to DEAL with it all because I live in an apartment building. Could a cop actually come here and deal with this? Again we've spoken with our landlord multiple times, he said they'd be getting rid of it, they obviously snuck it back in so I feel like it's beyond his control. Should I contact a code enforcer?

Location: South Florida

So for just a run down of the lead up to this: I met a real estate agent through doing freelance web development last year and though I never ended up doing any work for them we had a long discussion about businesses we wanted to start and then he got busy and I didn't hear from him for 6 months.

A couple of months ago he reaches out to me about starting one of the businesses we were talking about and we started building a plan, at the start he wanted me to show him what I was doing to find products and he wanted the work to be 50/50. We found a couple of products and decided to register an LLC.

Now unfortunately I have been dealing with a family members health issues and I now basically have no free time (I work 9-6 every day) I explained this to him and he was fine and said he'd handle the llc and he'd start using the techniques I taught him to find products.

Fast forward to now and he's literally texting me every single day asking if I've done any work and he hasn't lifted a finger once. Due to medical bills I now have very little extra money which should've been fine considering he wanted to bankroll this anyway but now he's expecting me to purchase everything on my credit card.

Needless to say I don't feel this is going to be a good partnership and I no longer wish to continue working with him. Are there any legal repercussions to shutting down the llc now?",2

Fast forward to today - I’m now getting sued for almost $1200 in “unpaid” invoices (that I never received).  Apparently, they went every week, charged me for double mows (because the grass was too high - although I was literally mowing it every week), and for leaf cleanup in December.

What defense do I have here?  I never agreed to these... I only asked them for a quote.  I never signed a contract, or even verbally gave them the ok to do this.  I’m assuming they thought my request for a quote was asking them to provide service.

I’m not in any financial position to pay $1200 to anyone. I’m in the process of building my business, and I literally am only making $1300 each month.

Need some advice,1,dppk7h,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dppk7h/need_some_advice/,2,1572566344.0,"Hello! 

I do freelance marketing. I had a client that I built a website for and did some marketing. He decided he didn't want to work with me anymore, so I went to his office to settle the outstanding balance and transfer the website. This was understood through email exchanges. When I went to his site, I completed the transfer and requested payment. He became abusive and started screaming obscenities but eventually called me to do a credit card payment over the phone because he claimed to have issues using the online system to make the payment.

About a month after, he filed a chargeback - which meant the money was taken from my account on the day my rent was due. This chargeback nearly got me evicted and hurt me badly financially. 

Now, I was able to get this chargeback reversed as it was fraudulent and I had evidence to that fact but it took months. 

This former client called me today to 'fix' his website as there are things he wanted to change the last time I was there but 'forgot' in his temper tantrum. I don't want to deal with this customer again. His contract was terminated by his request and the whole issue with the payment and chargeback has me wanting to tell him to go fornicate with a cactus. (I won't say that as I am better at customer service than that!) 

My question is this: Do I legally owe him any more of my time or barring that, a refund? The website was finished per the original agreement back in March but his 'opinion' on the matter is that because the chargeback was reversed, he paid for any changes he wants. I disagree, as these changes did not even come up until the day he decided to cancel the contract in June. Additionally, his bad behavior the last time I was at his office would have made me fire him as a client because I simply do not do business with people like that.

I was on my way home from work and I stopped at a stoplight. A person I thought was a woman approached my car and asked me for some change. Feeling generous, I proceeded to stop and hand ""her"" some change. Then afterwards, I got a call from a friend and here in Jamaica, it's illegal to drive and talk on the phone. Stopped for a bit to answer the phone after I drove a little distance away. The person followed me and managed to lull me into a sense of comfort and it was only then that I realized it was a prostitute. Not really paying attention to the fact that ""she"" was one, I realized that I needed some help finding a road that was apparently nearby (I am one of the worst people at remembering road names). I ask her to direct me to the road. She proceeds to say I'll lead you there because it's ""complicated to explain"". Not seeing the harm, I let her in and she directed me to a road nearby and after stopping, proceeds to offer her services for less than she normally does.

Again at this point (I was admittedly stupidly naive and very stressed from lack of sleep and work), I didn't see the harm. However, not three minutes after things began and I gave ""her"" the change she asked for, three other people came up. During the time, ""she"" managed to swipe my phone and my wallet, taking the phone and just the cash left in the wallet (there wasn't much in there thankfully and everything else was intact short of the change in my wallet). At this point, I panic because that phone has a lot of my work on it as well as social media information and some other stuff (nothing vital) not to mention that it was then that I discovered that this ""woman"" was actually a cross dresser (You can imagine how incredibly disgusted I felt with myself after I discovered that) and that they apparently recorded a video of what went on. One of the people that came up promises to return the phone and delete the video which they say will go viral if I don't comply in exchange for a certain amount of money. Again, I'm naive and I was desperate to get my phone back (I've never been stolen from before in my entire life before this), I went and got the requested amount, only for them to not return the phone. Now enraged at myself for being nice and naive (which is what got me into this mess in the first place), I went to the nearest police station (which was about a 5 or 10 minute drive) and gave a statement, but I was terrified and left out the prostitution part.

Did I make the right move? Or did I dig myself into a deeper hole? I'm actually panicking right now and didn't sleep for the entire night because I have no idea what the hell is gonna happen today...",2

I posted that when a friend started going through a rough patch in her marriage with her Marine husband having affairs with other service members. That was 2 years ago and since then a lot has happened. I am asking for a bit more advice given the current situation now, as 'shit's getting real'.

1) She fell for the ""I'll change"" crap he gave her, knowing his secret was out, and her wanting to preserve the relationship - against almost everyone else's advice but that's what happens. She didn't file, but looked into it. She didn't approach the JAG or anything, however there was a Board of Inquiry based on the complaints of one of the women he was having an affair with.

2) He contacted one of the women he was having an affair with when she was named in the BoI and instructed her to lie about never having had a relationship with him, and he lied to the BoI about ever having any relationship with her. Proof exists that they were both sexually involved for quite some time however, and this was just an organized lie to the BoI.

3) He has now continued to have affairs with other enlisted service women, and the proof of that is piled up and preserved by his soon to be ex wife. Including proof of #2.

4) They were reassigned to a post in TX. Due to an injury and needing to recoup with help she stayed in another state for a while. When recovered, he told her not to come to TX (affairs were in full swing). She has travelled there only one time to try and get her stuff that was shipped during the PCS - and he is demanding that she pay him back for her plane ticket to do this... 

5) ... Despite him refusing the accept their belongings from the move, so the trip was pointless she found out upon arrival. He now holds all of their belongings in limbo, not allowing her to access them as they haven't been 'delivered' yet.

6) He is now threatening to take her off of medical insurance, auto insurance, and off of financial accounts (CC's and bank) within the next days to weeks. He is pushing her to file for divorce outside of TX, where she is - because it's a no-fault state.

6) She knows she can not use the JAG as her divorce lawyers, but is wondering if they can offer her any services at this point to help reclaim her things, avoid being cut off financially and insurance wise (auto and health), while she files and deals with the divorce. 

7) Since he is posted in TX, are they then 'residents' of TX, and can she file for divorce there? Her prospects in getting something equitable out of the split are much better there than in the other state where she's been forced to stay with friends this entire time since the PCS.  


My biggest question is, and I feel strongly about this despite her NOT wanting to ruin his career any more than it's already been damaged... is can someone do anything to inform the JAG to look into his BoI and the statements given? And when (not if) the subsequent affairs are brought out in the divorce proceedings, is there anyway to have them look at those in addition to the original to give it all more context to his character?  He is in a position that I would feel someone who is untrustworthy should NEVER be in. Some of the people he's been having these affairs with and lying to (or who have been aware and complicit) are in the Intelligence community.",20

Discrimination at Work,1,dpp02p,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dpp02p/discrimination_at_work/,34,1572563938.0,"I've been at my company almost 5 years. Long and short of it, there were a bunch of employees arriving at work around 5:30 am. Certain people were getting overtime and milking the clock so now nobody is allowed to clock in before 6 am. Mind you, I've never had overtime. I barely get 32 hours a week. 

So a few Fridays ago I was working and I arrived with 2 other of my coworkers. They were able to clock in and I wasn't, it said I needed management approval. One of my coworkers said that it's happened to them before too. That management is targeting certain employees time clocks while others can clock in whenever.

Today, I had to drop off my child at daycare. I arrived at 6:40 am. 5 other of my coworkers were already there and working. It would not allow me to clock in without management approval. **I asked them what time they clocked in, they said 6 am**. I went to HR and they said they couldn't clock me in without management approval. My boss wasn't in yet. So I waited about 20 mins and then I left work, picked up my child from daycare and went home.

I got into a huge text argument with my boss and basically she is going to write me up for insubordination and patient abandonment while I feel I have a discrimination suit on my hands. In our conversation (which I saved, I'm writing the verbatim of what she text) she even says **""I WAS WILLING TO CLOCK YOU FOR YOUR ARRIVAL TIME. AND MOVING FORWARD BASED ON EVERYONE ARRIVAL SO EARLY THE CLOCK WILL BE MODIFIED FOR EVERYONE**"".  So she admits that my time clock was being tampered with.  The point is, why am I not allowed to clock myself in to work while others can. It is not the first time this has happened.  If they try to defame me for insubordination and patient abandonment can I come back with discrimination law suit?

I do seasonal work on a hemp farm. I've had some issues with recieving my pay from this farm before ie. having to wait 3+ weeks to get payed and not being payed for all of my hours when I did recieve my check. 

So towards the end of this harvesting season, my bosses asked if I'd be able to stay at the processing warehouse as a ""security guard"" and they said they'd pay me for the hours I stay overnight as well as give me a $50 gift card to walmart for food and whatever else I needed during my stay. So I stayed one night and quickly realized I didnt want to do this job for them. I am a small woman who would be unable to defend herself against someone trying to break in, I have a lot of anxiety and was unable to sleep, it was very cold, and I just felt uncomfortable doing that job for them, so I told them thanks for the offer but I can't continue with that. They didnt say anything or seem too upset about it, and I continued to do my regular work harvesting. 

3 days ago I recieved my pay and it was lower than what I had calculated it to be so I texted my boss and she said she deducted $50 from my pay for the cost of the walmart card since I didnt stay at the warehouse for as many nights as they wanted. Something about this seems fishy to me, as all I was told was that I would be ""given"" (that was the exact term they used) a gift card; no other requirements were layed out to me. She eventually answered my texts and said I could give her the gift card back and she would give me $50 cash. But I already spent the card, because to my knowledge, it was given to me without any stipulations. So now I just want to be payed my $50 that they deducted from my pay because if i had known that I'd have to pay back the cost of the gift card, I wouldnt have accepted the card at all. 

Do they have a right to deduct the cost of the gift card from my pay, even though it was never stated that I'd have to pay it back ?

VA - nursing license complaint,1,dpoa8q,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dpoa8q/va_nursing_license_complaint/,2,1572560777.0,"I'm an LPN in the state of Virginia. I was recently terminated from a position with a pediatric home health agency following a patient experiencing a sentinel event. 

Yesterday I got a letter from the department of health informing me of a complaint that my former employer has made against my license. (This has never happened to me before.) This letter requests that I address the allegations in written format within seven business days. They also requested information about all of my previous nursing employers (who they were, dates I worked for them, and reasons for leaving those positions). 

I am leery of providing too many specifics about the case here just for HIPAA reasons, but if there's something you feel I need to be a little more specific on, just ask. 

At the time of my termination, I was told why I was being let go in very generic terms. The patient had experienced a sentinel event and, as per company policy, all of the nurses that had worked with them recently were placed on administrative leave pending an investigation. (I was told that the investigation would be looking at documentation from the previous week, though the paperwork I have now does show that they must have gone two weeks deep.) Upon completion of the investigation, I was told that I was being terminated for failure to follow physician's orders, failure to report a change in condition, and improper documentation. I asked for specifics on what orders I didn't follow and was just told that I'd get a letter. 

The letter has just come in and it does contain the specifics, so I was only just now made aware of them. There's at least one thing on the list that I was doing specifically how I had been trained to do by two nurses and the mother, but apparently somewhere in the plan of care there's an order that says to do it differently. I wasn't aware of that. I'm sure I should have read the plan of care and at least noticed the discrepancy between what I was told to do and what the orders said. I DID read the plan of care and nothing like this stuck out to me, so maybe I missed it? Also, I was often told that the plan of care located in the home was not always exactly up to date. So, I feel like I was kind of put in a bad situation there specifically, even though I should have done a better job at confirming these orders. 

A few of the other allegations were along the lines of ""physician's order says to notify the physician if this vital sign is above this number for 1 hour. Nurse noted vital sign above this number for more than one hour for several days without notifying physician."" I have a couple of issues with that, the first being that I was not aware of that order at all and I can't confirm whether it was in the plan of care or not since I don't have access to it anymore. I also can't confirm what vital signs were since I don't have access to that documentation anymore. But I am certain I would not have specifically noted how long vital signs remained at those numbers, since standard practice was to take one set of vitals at the beginning of the shift and if there was a significant change later, that would be noted. But vital signs are in constant flux, at least minorly, so I definitely didn't specifically say it was this number for this long. 

I did not behave perfectly and I did make a couple of mistakes here. But I do take issue with some of these allegations, and some of the others I feel like I'm in a disadvantaged position to address because I don't have access to the plan of care and the documention, so when it says ""order said X and you did Y"" I have to rely on memory entirely and that doesn't seem...fair? 

(Also, not sure if this would be relevant, but I have no idea if I'm the only nurse dealing with this or not. For all I know I'm the only one they fired and they're saying everything is all my fault, or they fired all of the nurses on the case and we're all in this position right now.)

I feel like I need a lawyer to help me respond to this. I guess my question is, does anyone have any idea what kind of lawyer I should be looking for? And other advice about the situation wouldn't be terrible though. Also, long shot, but I just lost my job. Are there any financial resources that I could potentially utilize for this or something? 

Thank you for your time.",1

I have a question regarding a conversation I had with a woman I was pursuing a sugar baby/daddy relationship with. We are both located in Illinois if that provides any helpful context.

We were discussing our agreement and payment was sent in exchange for pictures on Snapchat. She then immediately asked for more money and took them off of the snapchat conversation, and she said she wouldn't put them back until the newly requested amount was posted.

I responded that this wasn't part of the agreement and took a screenshot of the snapchat conversation to show where she agreed to the initial amount. (Note: I did not screenshot or save any of the videos or pictures she sent me, only the text conversation).

After I expressed that this was unfair, she reiterated that she would not post the pictures originally agreed upon. This upset me so I took screenshots of the conversation and told her that I would make sure no other men would fall for her scam (again, none of the screenshots contained any images of her - only her snapchat name).

Several hours later, she then responded that she was going to file a police report because of what I said, and she asked me if I was posting the screenshots on facebook, because she was planning on filing a police report. 

I messaged her that nothing is going on facebook. She then asked where the screenshots would be posted. 

I responded that I am not posting any screenshots and that I do not believe in doxing/harassing(What I said earlier was out of frustration and I had no intention of publishing anything from our conversation). 

She then continues to say she needs the payment she requested, and that left me with a bad feeling. I asked why she is asking for payment and she hasn't responded.

I have a few questions:

1) Can someone get in legal trouble for publishing conversations that expose someone for scamming (note: I stated that I would make sure others didn't fall for her scams, referencing the screenshots I took).

2) Is she extorting me by suggesting that she needs payment right after mentioning a police report against me for saying I would make sure others didn't fall for her scams?

I am happy to provide any clarifications and I thank you for your insight.",1

Nothing in the lease says this was to be implemented and when I have asked about why this has happened the management stated there are NY laws saying apartments must be at 69 degrees. I cannot find such laws. 

Does anyone have any information about this or suggestions? I pay a flat fee each month for utilities so I have a feeling this is just a way the complex can lower  costs by limiting air con and heating use of each tenant.",7

"Scholarship ""is not able"" to send funds",22,dpcous,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dpcous/scholarship_is_not_able_to_send_funds/,3,1572497650.0,"First time posting here, so hopefully this is done right. Sorry for the length!

TLDR at the end 

4 Years ago I won a scholarship that was worth $10,000, with $2500 being paid out yearly while we were still in school, with the stipulation that I maintained a certain GPA. I have maintained that GPA and sent my transcripts anytime they have asked for them (they asked every semester for the first 3 semesters), then stopped. The first semester they told me they would be slightly behind on sending the first check out since they were in an audit and massive staff turnover (this is a local non-profit). They also usually have one winner for the large scholarship and multiple smaller ones, but the year I won, there was a second winner (we attend university together). 

I had planned to use that scholarship check to cover my housing with the university and I kept getting told it would be delayed. At the end of my spring semester, my payment for the housing was late, and I was kept from enrolling in classes because I couldn't afford the housing bill. I got my parents involved who called the university and the organization, and they came to an agreement that the organization would pay the university directly in my name in a month's time when the funding became unfrozen. This was in May/June of 2017. 

Fast forward to November 2017, I get a call from the university saying I have like 3 days to pay or I'm going to be locked out of classes for the next semester because, surprise, they never paid or got in contact again. I needed to be able to enroll in classes in order to keep another scholarship that I have, and I immediately got in contact with them, explained the situation, and they said they would try to find the funds to send immediately. After pestering them for a few days and having a lot of phone calls, they finally paid the amount as a sponsor in my housing account (just the way the university made them do it to process in time).  I thank them for handling it quickly and they say they hope it doesn't happen again later that year etc. 

I called again that February and got lead around in circles before having to take out a student loan to help pay my rent for the semester (I have always worked in college, but after realizing I wasn't getting that money, I haven't worked less than 3 jobs at any given time to help pay for expenses and the loans. I now am working 5 jobs, between 45-70 hours a week and am a full-time student with other part-time gigs as they come). I decided that I wasn't going to get that money so I kind of forgot about it, but this last August I was contacted by the other winner and was asked if I ever received any of the money since she hadn't. I told her I hadn't after that first year. 

I called again about a month ago and found out that they had lost their financial support so they were looking for new financial backers for the scholarship (at least that's what I was told). I was also told that there were a lot of people on hold for this year's scholarship at which point I pointed out that I hadn't received anything the previous two years as well. The person on the phone put me on hold while looking my information up, and when he got back to me seemed very nervous to confirm what I told him. He said he would see what he could do and give me a call back a few days later. After a week I called back and the front desk said they would let him know I called and get back to me. I'm still waiting for that call back about month later. 

&#x200B;

**TLDR:** Scholarship has been leading me on about paying the amount awarded/promised, claims they have no more backers and owe tens of thousands of dollars to multiple students. Anything we can do to get the funds?

Not sure if there is anything I can do at this point? Is the money ever going to come in? I would really like the loan to be paid off, but also I feel really unsettled that there are a lot of people who are dealing with this organization (respected in our community) and that they are not being told up front what is happening. My parents want me to take it to the local news stations so that at the very least people know what is going on, but I'm not sure that exposing them would do any good. 

&#x200B;

Just looking for some thoughts and advice from people who may know more about laws, regulations, and the specifics of what can and can't be done.

Thanks in advance!",22

Everything is in the works already, we’re already approved and should be matched with a child any day now since the wait isn’t too long at the moment.      
   
Obviously any child is already a thai citizen and we do plan to stay here. But later in life, should we want to return for any reason, would we be able (obviously with our child.) I can’t seem to find this answer anywhere since most people adopting abroad still reside in the US. We are both natural born US citizens, my husband was medically retired from the US army. But with all the visa changes and laws changing everyday around immigration to the US, will our citizenship give any good favor to the child chances of acquiring a visa? I know Asian countries arent the focal point of today’s immigration problems stateside, but still. Would our child ever be able to become a full citizen should we return?    
   
I’d really love if someone had any insight into how this would theoretically work if we ever did come home.

1. I'm open to breaking the lease and moving because this is absurd. I'd hate to do it because I'm only in NJ until next July so I'd be likely paying more rent for a shorter lease.
2. Get them to fix the alarms or remove the tenants that are hot boxing or whatever their apartment.
3. Any kind of financial reimbursement. Honestly don't care as much about this but if there is a threat of it hopefully they fix the issues or subsidize any additional rent I'd have to pay for a shorter lease somewhere.

My father had oesophagus cancer. He was having radiotherapy and caught pneumonia.

He was admitted to hospital where they treated his pneumonia. They state his conditions were stable and blood test clear.

After the blood test, he was taken to another hospital for radiotherapy for a day, then BACK to the hospital who treated him for pneumonia. They kept him there a further two days and discharged him (against his wishes) WITHOUT any further blood tests.

They state that there were no clinical concerns for recurrence of infection and vital observations were stable. I would argue that the radiotherapy would have been a high clinical concern as it reduces white blood cells and can lead to reoccurring infection.

Anyway, they discharged him (also, without informing any of his family) and i had to call him an ambulance the next day to admit him back into hospital (3 hours waiting in A&E). His condition then rapidly declined before he passed away.

Does anybody think that I should take this further? My father wasn't in the greatest of health to start with (double leg amputee), and had been given 6 months to live when diagnosed with his oesophagus cancer.",1

The builder (this is a new build) had prepaid taxes (city, county, school, and property) though the end of the year and though the school year for the school/property taxes. 

If I’m already being asked to escrow for property and school taxes, can I push back on these adjustments? Can they even charge me for these prepaid taxes?

Currently, I work at a Charter School in New Hampshire. It is a K-8 school but separates the elementary and middle school by floors (Elementary is downstairs and middle school is upstairs). Every Friday we have shortened class periods so that we can have an extra hour at the end of the day for ""Enrichment"". We use Enrichment to have activities for students, for example, last year I did a Video Game Enrichment one term, there's also a Student Council, Board Games Club, Art Club, Drama Club, etc. This year, since so many of the middle school students have started to come out to me and other teachers, I brought up the idea of having a GSA (Gendering and Sexuality Alliance) for an Enrichment. I pitched it in an email as follows:

`This is obviously open to all students no matter sexual orientation or gender identity. My idea is during the enrichment we would learn about LGBTQ+ History, make fundraising ideas for the group and donate to LGBTQ+ charities and maybe for us to go on field trips, and possibly guest speakers that can talk to the students. I wanted to create a group this way students know they have a group of people that they can be honest and open with about themselves in the school.` 

Originally I never heard back from the email so I recently brought it up to the Principal (and founder of the Charter School) again. She told me no because of their age and she didn't want anything controversial.  It took me a bit to process the information, as someone who is bisexual I was also personally offended by being told creating a community for our LGBTQ+ youth was controversial.

I have done a bit of research myself and found [this](https://www.glad.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/gsa-public-schools.pdf) where it says if a secondary school has other non-curriculum related student groups they must provide equal access to all student groups, including GSA. The couple of things we are confused about is if Enrichment counts as non-curriculum. They are supposed to be educational but they don't have to be a part of the schools' curriculum. We were thinking of pitching it as an after school activity instead to deal with that issue but I am hoping to avoid that. Since we are a Charter School we have students from all over New Hampshire. Staying after school won't be attainable for all of them who may be interested and I don't want students to be excluded if we don't need to. The other part we are questioning is the ""secondary school"" wording. From the limited research I did, I could not find an official legal definition in New Hampshire for ""Secondary School"" but I found that it is usually defined after elementary school and before college (which middle school falls under).

I have done very limited research on this, I am a teacher time isn't something I have a lot of, so I decided to reach out here. I really want a supportive community for the LGBTQ+ students at the school and if legally I can have it, no matter what the Principal says, I want to have as much information as possible. Anything you all can help me with will be greatly appreciated!

A Conplete Mess and Controling Family,0,dpqkb7,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dpqkb7/a_conplete_mess_and_controling_family/,2,1572570559.0,"So some preface. I am not the person in question, but do have permission from the person to look for advice on their behalf. The State is Tennessee. That was the closest flair I can think of, so I am not entirely sure if it is accurate.

I (21), am friends with someone who is older (25), and have been for a while. They are in a situation that they have been stuck in since they were young. They still live with their toxic and controlling parents not out of want but for basic survival and the fact that so much of their life is controlled by said parents.

To make the point with the information I know alone: They force a tracker on their phone. They make their paycheck go into a joint account that she essentially had no access to without it being known (and she can't open another one with her name in a different bank due to said tracker.) If they do not answer all phone calls while out and the tracker shows they are anywhere then where but where they approve or specifically know before hand, they withhold basic necessities (Any food at all or sanitary items.)

They does, however, have a car that was supposed to be in their name once they graduated highschool. This obviously did not happen. (Though I don't think it is illegal in TN, most car dealerships will not sign a car over to anyone under 18 even if they are paying for it.)

Them staying in this environment have lowered their mental and physical health to a really bad place (they are not only mentally abusive, but are physically be too.)

Obviously, everyone (any friend they still have and her), realizes this is terrible and that they need to get out. The question is how. Legally, they can go poof, but with what means, since car is not in their name and all money earned by them is not seen by them? 

Of course, I heard a term from other people I have talked to in person about Pro Bono, but I'm not sure about the details of what entails. I do not want them to be in the aftermath of what happened last time they tried to leave. (Threatned  to report the car stolen and them missing, then when they returned essentially took away anything they had beyond a minimal survival, happened when they were age 22.)

Right now, the only two options that can happen right now are:

1. Best case scenario is a lawyer that will be able to help them legally at (?) Pro bono.

2. They go poof with maybe a days worth, a week, at best's worth,of survival material.

I am four hours driving distance away with no car, and do not want to risk further escalating the situation before they are ready to completely cut off contact (something they plan on doing after they leave) by sending essential stuff and having their parents get it first.

So what can they legally do?",0

I rent a no-pet apartment near campus for when I go to school.

I told my landlord that I left for a few months and they're telling me that I need to relocate my cat while I am gone. I have lived there for a few years and showed them my pet prescription when I moved in and there were no issues until now.

Job advertised as “Marketing Manager” and turns out to be selling Direct TV to people at sams club. (North Carolina),0,dpqho4,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dpqho4/job_advertised_as_marketing_manager_and_turns_out/,14,1572570240.0,"
I’ve been looking for a job and got an interview for a position as an “Introductory Marketing Manager”. I was a bit surprised I got an interview since I’ve got no formal degree in marketing, but I did do the marketing for a small mom and pop shop (amongst other things) so I figured they wanted some new blood. 

Their website is vague, which I attributed to NDA’s or whatever other corporate bs. So I get this interview and before the interview starts I ask “what exactly is this job, and what would I do” and he goes well we are a B2B marketing company working with A,B&C tech companies (big telecom and other tech) to bring them into the local environment. Blah blah, not a sales job, we don’t focus on sales” so we talk and it goes well and they ask me to come in today for a second interview. 

Long story short the job is selling stuff at Costco & Walmart for $10 an hour plus commissions. It was advertised as a $30-50,000 a year depending on experience. This job is clearly not a “marketing manager” position. I confronted the co-owner and asked why I was mislead as to the actual job and he came back at me all defensive and responds with “well you started out the interview popping off questions not letting me talk.” Really one question: “what is this job exactly”  so I just said thank you shook his hand and walked out. 

I went back on the job advertising site and they have a ton of jobs advertised by all sorts of names and descriptions but they’re all the same thing. This is clearly a short hop away from fraud and if I wasn’t so persistent in finding out what the job actually was I’d have been made a sucker.  

I don’t want to sue these people but I do want to warn other people before they waste their time. Is there some government agency I can call and file a complaint with? I’m really mad they tried to con me into what is basically a job at sams club and Costco.",0

Yes, I file copyright takedown notices, DMCA claims, etc, but we are a small business. I can’t dedicate all hours to tracking down every time they’ve taken something and are marketing it on some weird Facebook post or twitter feed or whatever. 

I have had several just in the last few days on Gear Launch alone. My guess is that the person doing the thieving is overseas, but the printer is enabling it by printing our designs and profiting, and especially by allowing them to keep reposting the same thing over and over and over. 

My question is: Do I have any recourse against the printers themselves for not shutting down shops especially after repeated notice? I know many, MANY other artists who are dealing with this same issue. Is this something that could be a class action lawsuit? 

I’m just very, very tired of these guys stealing and profiting off of our work, especially when we are trying to sell it ourselves. I know it’s a part of business, but it doesn’t make it any less exhausting.

My now ex boss seems to discriminate against me and docked my pay and hours.,0,dpqbh9,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dpqbh9/my_now_ex_boss_seems_to_discriminate_against_me/,2,1572569513.0,"So yesterday I was fired and previously before that I had been reprimanded in public, in front of customers and co workers. My boss has had words with me ever since I complained ONCE to her about a co worker making me uncomfortable. This co worker complains to my boss about anyone and everything all the time, so I’m sure she wasn’t happy about me doing that as well even though I’ve only done it once. Since that incident it seems like my boss as only been reprimanding me for stuff that we’re supposed to do but now suddenly we don’t do it anymore, and stuff like checking my phone. I work with young adults and teenagers (save for the old lady that complains all the time), so we obviously will go on our phones. The business doesn’t get much attention, not many customers so we often sit there on our phones since there’s not much else to do.

However only I get reprimanded and it seems to have started after I complained one time about feeling uncomfortable. My boss then fired me yesterday (she never said “you’re fired” but said to leave my key in the drawer and took me off the app we use for work) and my mom told me I should tell her discrimination is illegal to “scare” her, so I wrote a lengthy message telling her I’ve felt like I’ve been discriminated against and it was totally not cool to reprimand me in front of customers. She didn’t answer nor read my message. I don’t have a huge problem with that, it’s just some things I’ve been bottling up since I worked there.

Now when I got fired I took a screenshot of my earnings and hours as I had a feeling something like this would happen. I check my earnings and hours last night, and I somehow lost 30 minutes of work time over night... thus leading to a pay check with less money... I ask my other boss (they’re boyfriend and girlfriend) and he says “less hours equal less pay” and I say yes, I know that, but how can my hours change over night? And sent him the screenshot of my hours being changed and my pay check going down. He hasn’t answered me, it’s been another day.

My parents suggest I keep texting him about it, but my mom figures since I mentioned discrimination they’re trying to ignore me because they don’t want to face any legal issues.

I live in FL, and legally they don’t have to tell you why you’re fired, but I have a hunch (the discrimination and the fact that I didn’t take her shit like everyone else did) and I of course want my last full pay check that doesn’t have my hours docked. Any help?",0

Possible pay cut?,12,dpfaqb,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dpfaqb/possible_pay_cut/,2,1572508792.0,"Hi all. I am a sales manager for a hotel. The current hotel owners, Company X, are selling the hotel to Company Y. Currently, I am a salaried manager making $56k and I work 40 hrs a week. Translated to hourly rates, I make about $27 an hour. When Company X announce earlier this year they would be selling the hotel they gave all managers a letter essentially saying if new company did not bring us on board or offer the same compensation, they would pay us out 6 months worth of salary. This is exactly what the letter says regarding that, word for word:

*Based on your position as Sales Manager, you will be eligible to receive a retention bonus equal to six months' base pay, upon completion of the sale, if you are either: (a) not retained by the incoming manager in a similar capacity or, (b) offered similar employment with Company X. For this purpose, ""similar capacity"" and ""similar employment"" mean the substantially the same compensation and benefit package, the same FLSA-Exempt status and the same general geographic area. Of course, to be eligible, you remain continuously employed from no through to the sale date and have remained in good standing during that period.*

So, Company Y sent me my offer letter today in which they state I am no longer going to be considered salary. I will now be hourly and my regular pay rate is $21.22 and my overtime pay rate is $31.83. Oh and in order to make my $56k annual pay, I now have to work 47.5 hr weeks. If I only work 40 hr weeks, I'll only be making around $44k essentially taking a $12k pay cut. Here is the wording of the offer letter, word for word:

*As a Sales Manager, you are an overtime eligible manager. It is understood that your bi-weekly earnings are based on the following rates of pay: a regular rate of $21.22 per hour and an overtime rate of $31.83 per hour. The overtime rate is equal to one and one-half times your regular hourly rate. The regular rate will be paid for all hours worked up to forty (40) in the workweek or eight (8) in a single day and the overtime rate will be paid for any hours worked over forty (40) in the workweek or over eight (8) in a day, or in accordance with state law. It is understood that actual bi-weekly earnings may vary (upward or downward) based on the actual hour worked, and that you will be scheduled based on 47.5 hours worked weekly. Your work schedule will be affected by both operational demands and personal time off requests. Based on the 47.5 hours worked, your projected annual base earnings (based on working every week) will be approximately $56,551.30 annualized rate of pay.*

So my questions are:

1. is this legal?

2. can this really be considered similar compensation? Considering I was previously working 40 hr weeks making my pay rate $27 but now I'm only being offered $21?

3. Is there anything I can do? I am a new mom and just got back from my maternity leave about 2 weeks ago. Prior to having my daughter I would have been very annoyed but sucked it up, but now, the thought of having to not only be away from my daughter an extra 1 hr+ each day but also pay for another hour or more of babysitting is not something I want to do. 

Am I just shit out of luck? Any advice would be hugely appreciated and welcomed.",12

All I would need to do is schedule a time with them to bring it back in to have it installed. No problem.

Skip forward about a week. I hit a massive pothole and bent my rim. So I called the service department at dealership and tell them, “Hey this is such and such, I bent my rim and need to schedule a time to come in and get that repaired. Oh! Also since you guys will have my car in already; can we go ahead and get that Apple car play installed?” Service guy says, “ yeah! Sure! No problem” I take the car in for the repair.

Cactus Removal in AZ,3,dpjilw,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dpjilw/cactus_removal_in_az/,3,1572531308.0,"Hello reddit. I’m a roofer in Arizona and after completing a job, the customer asked if I knew anyone who removes cactuses as he wants to remove 2 from his property. Since I have a pretty big dump trailer and a chainsaw at my disposal, I offered to do it for him and told him I would contact him another day to talk about it. When I finally got home I immediately googled how to videos and the first thing that popped up was that it is illegal to remove a cactus in my state and can face up to 25 years in prison as it’s a federal crime (even if it’s deemed a hazard) without getting the proper permits. 

So my question is, is there any way for me or the homeowners to get a permit so I can take them down? Or do they need to hire a proper cactus removing company to do it as well? They’re an elderly, retired couple who are strapped on cash and have been giving rather expensive quotes (nearly $2k)",3

For the last 5 years, I've been completing web development and graphic design related work exclusively. During this 5 year span, I've been promised some form of promotion annually, but have never seen any form of compensation for this work and have never held a job title related to the work that I've been completing. Every year the amount of pressure increases with shorter deadlines, overtime requirements, deviations from schedules to meet with colleagues in other countries (to accommodate for timezone). All of this time I've been paid a support level salary with annual increases that barely cover annual inflation. Every time I bring up promotions that have been promised they tell me, ""The company will have to budget for that,"" or some other excuse.

I love my job, but I feel like my labor is being exploited and like I have no other choice but to look for opportunities elsewhere at other companies.

"[Arizona] Consent laws, and detective saying ""not enough evidence"" despite a mountain of said evidence",6,dpgi6j,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dpgi6j/arizona_consent_laws_and_detective_saying_not/,26,1572514322.0,"First off, this post is on behalf of a close friend in Phoenix, who is 17.

&#x200B;

She went to a party at a friends house, and smoked some marijuana. At some point she spaced out, and ended up next to a guy, also 17, who started cuddling her. He then took off her leggings, and she froze. He did not ask for consent, nor did he say anything. He had sex with her, without a condom, which she would ***NEVER*** consent to, no matter who. She left the party, went home to wake her parents, and immediately went to a hospital for testing. The leggings she was wearing at the time were taken as evidence, and she got antibiotics. They took a urine sample. She talked to a detective at the hospital, who assured her that this was, in fact, rape.

&#x200B;

Fast forward a bit, she decides to press charges, thanks to advice from Reddit (thank y'all), her parents, and myself. She talks to a detective, and tells her half of the story. She doesn't hear from the police for a week or two. During this time, she goes to get a therapist assigned. Her insurance has allowed her trauma therapy*. I don't know if this matters.*

&#x200B;

Two days ago, she was blocked by the host of the the party, a friend of hers. The detective calls her, and tells her that she ""needs better friends."" This leads us to believe that he said something un-helpful. Note, that during the rape, the host and 'friend' was in another room, and didn't know what was happening.

&#x200B;

Yesterday, she received another call from the detectives, saying that *there was not enough evidence to do anything.* I am completely at a loss as to what to do or tell her even...

&#x200B;

My questions:

1) Is there any way to get another police or otherwise free detective to look into this?

2) How is it even remotely possible there isn't enough evidence to do anything? We've both looked into the laws surrounding this and it can't possibly be legal.

i) she is under the age of consent, and could not consent if she wanted to, legally speaking

ii) she was under the influence of a drug, which makes it impossible for her to consent, even if she wanted to

iii) she didn't consent. He didn't ask for consent, and she wouldn't have given consent.

iv) does the fact that she didn't try to fight back hurt the case in any way?

3) Is there anything that the party host 'friend' could possibly have said to just make the cops go away???

4) Is there anything I can do, given that I live in California?

5) What would be the proper protocol to appeal the decision that there isn't enough evidence to do anything?

She went into the store to ask for a pen and paper to leave a note. She panicked and left a blank note since she was with a friend and wanted to look moral, but justified it to herself that she had too much to handle already and that there was no visible damage at all.

Now she says she's been seeing what she thinks is the same car there when she goes to that store. She wants to leave a note apologizing and offering her contact info to get it resolved. She said her first note would just be to ask if they were at the store at the time of the accident and offer her phone number, just to make sure it's the right car.

I'm proud of her owning up to it, but I don't want her to incriminate herself. On the other hand, it was a busy time of day and she stayed at the scene for a while so I feel it might be possible that witnesses documented and shared her plates and vehicle description.

Money is not an issue, and I want her to do the right thing, but I feel the need for legal counsel first. At the same time I don't have much influence since her mother (my sister) relayed all this to me; I don't talk to my niece much directly.

Not returning to work after PAID leave (California),0,dpmbnj,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dpmbnj/not_returning_to_work_after_paid_leave_california/,4,1572551040.0,"I’m currently on paid maternity leave and am considering not returning to work. I understand how this sounds but before I had my baby I fully intended on returning. Things have changed since then and I no longer want to return. 

This is a moral issue as well as a legal one and appreciate you withholding your personal opinions related to the moral aspect. I have more than paid my dues to this company over the last 15 years so I am at peace with my decision and only need to be aware of any financial or legal obligations I have to my employer. 

My primary concern is whether I’ll owe any money to my employer if I don’t return to work. 

The information I found regarding FMLA (and all of the similar posts I’ve seen on this sub) refer to paying back insurance premiums on UNPAID leave if I don’t return to work:

> Under the regulations, the employer may recover its share of health plan premiums during a period of unpaid FMLA leave from an employee if the employee fails to return to work [(source)](https://www.fmlainsights.com/fmla-faq-when-employee-on-fmla-leave-indicates-they-will-not-return-from-fmla-leave-what-should-an-e/)

Are there any requirements to pay back insurance premiums, wages, or anything else if I don’t return from my PAID leave? 

I read that employees who return to work for at least 30 days after UNPAID leave don’t have to pay anything back:

> You might have to pay back your health insurance premiums. If your maternity leave was covered by the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), your employer was legally required to continue your health insurance benefits during your time off. If you decide not to come back from leave, your employer has a right to seek reimbursement of any money it paid to keep your health benefits in place.

>However, this right to reimbursement does not apply if you return to work for 30 days or more. [(source)](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/quitting-your-job-after-maternity-leave-issues-to-consider.html)

Does the same apply to PAID leave?

If yes, is it 30 calendar days or 30 work days? 

Finally, I have approximately three weeks of PTO saved. I was NOT required to use this time on my maternity leave. Generally when employees resign, they are paid out for their unused PTO. If I do not return to work, or if I only return for a short time, would I lose this PTO balance?

Are there any other financial or legal issues related to not returning to work from a PAID leave that I should consider?

We knew it was coming but it was still a difficult time.  Anyway we met my grandfathers appointed executive of his estate, and he didn’t sit right with me, he was very strange and made me uncomfortable. When we first met he grabbed my hand so hard and squeezed so hard my knees buckled. He also cannot be alone with any woman in my family because of how he makes us feel. The last time he hugged my grandmother he nearly cracked her ribs and dug her pace maker into her chest with the force of it. 

Throughout this past year and a half he was supposed to be doing his job but my mother and my grandmother have been schlepping around to different places sorting this whole mess out. One of his most recent screw ups was he “forgot” to inform the bank to release the money into my grandmothers account. The money is currently sitting in my grandfathers account which is frozen and she can’t move it due to the account being frozen. 

Today she tried to activate a transfer and understand why she couldn’t do it without her executor the lady at the bank said something was very fishy about the whole situation, we are worried he’s trying to scam her out of the little money she has. Later on in the day he called her is a rage and screamed at her on the phone she hung up on him and he called her back and screamed again. She is not a fragile woman but she has been through a lot these past few years. Unfortunately we are not in a great financial situation and lawyers in South Africa are very expensive and he (the lawyer) was doing it pro bono. We are trying to get him removed as an executive, he is refusing to help her at all and has claimed he will be dropping off the files at her house because of her “betrayal”.

I told him to report it stolen.

So my brother has had a car sitting for a couple months just down the street from where he lives with very limited parking, because he has two cars he has been trying to sell this one. The town put a sticker notice saying they would tow it 30 days from October 18th. Yesterday they towed it.

Though he hasn't been driving it, it's still insured and had plates, 100% legal. He has been moving the spots since the notice up or down a couple so it's not remaining in the same spot. He went out there to change his tire (mysterious flat, he found finger marks on his dirty wheel near the tire valve) the day before it got towed and talked to a man who came out, turns out his car is sitting in front of the town Judge's house and the man was the Judge.

So that day a uniformed man came to his door (not sure if it was police or traffic patrol and they didn't identify themselves) demanding that he moves his car or they will tow it, my brother explained all this and that he has been moving it and it's not abandoned, and said he has to go out tomorrow morning to get an air compressor and breaker bar because his lug-nuts are seized to put his spare on to move it. Officer then said ""Ok I'll give you untill the morning."" My brother also let him know that the notice says  30 days from October 18th to be towed.

He went outside to go take care of it around 10am and the car was gone.

What should he do now? How illegal is what they did?

How is it not extortion if they towed it before they date they said it would and now are requiring money to get it back?

A couple weeks ago, my roommate and I were home and heard a knock on the door. Not really feeling too obligated to get up from our current tasks, we didn't answer. About ten seconds later the realty representative let herself into our apartment, seeing that we were home. She said something along the lines of, ""Oh! You're home.

Ideally, my roommate and I would like to be able to use their potential legal violation to not have to pay the $600 ""Early Marketing Fee"" and jump through the hoops their email says we will have to do if we want to sublet. 

&#x200B;

Any advice on these two issues would be greatly appreciated!

&#x200B;

 Here's the email regarding the subleasing: 

You are receiving this email because you have requested information about terminating your lease early. The first step in this process is to complete the “Early Marketing Agreement” or EMA. The Early Marketing Agreement form can be found on our website at **www.****\*\*\*\*****Rentals.com**, under the current tenant resources menu. Please make sure to fill this form out completely and return it to our office, with your Early Marketing Fee.

* **A fee of $600 is due upon execution of this Agreement.** This fee is to cover expenses and administration costs of finding/signing new tenants. The fee is non-refundable even if suitable replacements cannot be found. The fee is due when turning in the EMA. We will not seek, nor process any applicant until the form and payment have been completed. Payment must be made in the form of a cashiers check.
* While the property is still tenant occupied, you will be responsible for all showings and advertising of the property. You are free to advertise as you wish via Facebook, Craigslist, etc. All showings should be setup to contact you directly, therefore be sure to include YOUR contact info in any advertised listing. Once the property becomes vacant during your tenancy and you’ve completed an EMA, the management company will assume the showings and advertising.
   * Make sure to let us know via email at a minimum of 30 days in advance of your vacancy date.
   * Schedule a FINAL inspection with our office before vacating the property. You are required to follow the “move out checklist” also located on our website at www.\*\*\*\*\*Rentals.com, under current tenant resources.
* **As a tenant, you are responsible for rent and any utilities/obligations that are your responsibility per the lease for the duration of the existing Residential Rental Lease between Tenant and Agent, or until suitable replacement can be found. This also includes maintaining all utilities, lawn care, snow removal and any other lease obligations.**
* **If you are being charged an annual fee for an animal and have a monthly payment plan, the remaining prorated animal fee must be paid at the time of completing the EMA paperwork. There are no prorated fees or discounts for early termination of your lease in regards to animal fees. The animal fee was a one time fee, which you chose to make payments on. Those payments cannot be passed on, discounted or eliminated.**
* All prospective tenants must go through the application process with the management company and be approved to be considered. You can instruct anyone that might be interested to fill out the application at www.\*\*\*\*Rentals.com. Requirements are listed on the application page on our website in terms of income, credit score, references, etc.
* Once a new tenant has been approved and signed a lease, we will notify you of their move-in date. Any security deposit/cleaning fee that is owed to you, will be returned to you within 30 days of your lease ending provided you have returned all keys/parking passes/remotes, etc. An agent from the management company will schedule a final inspection with you, upon your vacancy.
* Be sure to thoroughly go through the ""Move Out Checklist"" on our resources page at www.\*\*\*\*Rentals.com to be aware of all of your obligations.
* There is a minimum 14 business days between your final move out date and the new tenants occupancy date for ""make ready"" purposes. This period is your responsibility to pay for. Therefore, your lease end date will be the day the new tenants take occupancy, not the day of your final inspection/move-out. You are still responsible for all lease obligations during that time.",4

Later on, when returning the equipment and signing the final charges, we finally realized that while the rental information was correct, the payment info had a name we did not recognize! We told the store employee that we wanted to settle the equipment charges using a different card, but then they exclaimed, 'Oops! We just ran it on the one on file!' They basically said they didn't have a way to reverse that.

&#x200B;

The deposit is something like $150.00 and won't be charged, as we returned the equipment in good condition, however the $60.00 charge for the actual rental is being charged to the other person's card.

&#x200B;

Are we going to face some kind of legal implication in this? We have been doing our best to reverse the charges, and it isn't an exorbitant amount of money. Also, we had no intention of committing fraud, however the store clerk ran the charge even though we had a different card (that actually was ours) in our hands at the time.

What should we expect as far as legal issues, and is there anything we can do to clear this up before it comes to that?

Dependent care account only partially available,0,dplsck,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dplsck/dependent_care_account_only_partially_available/,1,1572547837.0,"I am a medical resident leaving my current institution at the end of June. One of our benefits is a dependent care account, which is capped at $5000 by law. The elected amount is withheld across the year (26 paychecks).I am told by my institution that they have no mechanism for adjusting the rate of withholding to reach this maximum sooner in the year, i.e. Before I leave the institution. They are offering a single one time adjustment in my final paycheck, but my final paycheck is not large enough to account for half of the $5000.

Breach of contract question - farming hemp,2,dpjtxt,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dpjtxt/breach_of_contract_question_farming_hemp/,1,1572533641.0,"I’m part of a joint venture agreement with a farmer growing commercial hemp in California. The terms of the JV are my group receives 60% profits and the farmer 40% profits on any sale of final product for 25 acres. Part of the farmers obligation was to ensure proper certifications and legal requirements. The farmer refused to seek legal certification, perform testing, control aspects of farming etc. As a result my group refused to wire our capital investment based on his u willingness to follow the law of the state of California for a commercial hemp license. We cannot sell the final product (hemp flower) without legal required wing fulfilled.

We are finally ready to harvest and the farmer is out of money. He wants to sell off by the acre, the entire lot of 160 acres he has the land lease on. We have requested that he honor our original JV agreement terms and not sell the 25 acres by the acre but he refuses. He plans to sell everything and not pay us anything. He argues we broke the agreement by not paying him. We simply requested he provide all legal documents and we would provide the investment capital once a sale of the final product occurs.

Do we have any options legally to pursue against the farmer? What about a third party that engages with the farmer on a sale?",2

She said they have an opening in 3 days so I took the appointment.

I arrived on time, filled out the paper work, double checked by asking her if they take my insurance one more time. She said yes. Gave her my license and insurance card, she made copies, I sat down.

I get called in. Blah blah blah. I go to check out. The dr ordered some blood work and wanted to see me in a month. *I paid my $30 copay*, this is the important part. I was given a script for the bloodwork, and we made an appointment for a month later. 

At this point, I had work the next couple days so I couldn’t go get the bloodwork till Friday. But 2 days after the appointment, I get a call from some lady at that office and she says that “we screwed up and we don’t take your insurance” and asked if I wanted to keep the appointment to see the doctor in a month. I said no, obviously, and I asked her if the bloodwork was still covered and she said “probably not” so i never went for that either. 

About 3 weeks later I get a bill from my insurance denying that dr visit claim and a bill for $440. I called the doctors office and spoke to someone in billing/administrative and explained the problem. She was very rude and basically said that I have to file a grievance with my insurance company. I told her I will, but I also mentioned that they should be liable because they lied to me.

I work for a franchise that is broke and not paying their employees,3,dpi89c,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dpi89c/i_work_for_a_franchise_that_is_broke_and_not/,1,1572523071.0,"Pretty much the title. I've been working with this company for about a year now, starting what feels like my first decent job out of high school. I didn't go to college so I had to learn a skill, and this is something that I enjoy. I've had some slip ups and transportation problems but I've finally built up enough credit for my first car loan, that I am currently paying. I live with my parents to save money and it's a stable living situation for me, but not for my coworkers. They are hurting immensely because of this. We live in the state of Missouri.

So on the the meat of things. Our franchise owners have been late on several paychecks. The worst previously was around 5 days late. It makes 4 times in the last year they were late to pay us, with no reason as to why the checks were late. They changed payroll companies and hired a different person to manage payroll. That was around 4 months ago. Well, last payday (Friday Oct. 30th) came around there were no deposits into anyone's bank account. We were provided a brief message saying that they are working on a solution and would have an answer on Monday (Oct. 28th). Monday came around and we got an email saying that payroll funds would be wired to their account the next day, yesterday. Well, yesterday came around and there was no good news. We got another email saying that they were working on securing funding for payroll and continue to encounter snags. Said some other stuff about how their attorneys are in contact with the potential funds attorneys. It's now Wednesday night and things have been toppling down. Essentially, they're completely broke. They're relying on those potential funds for payroll and I learned that the deal for these potential funds have been ongoing for several months. Chances are it's going to take awhile for any of us to get paid. We aren't sticking around, everyone is looking for a new job immediately and seeking unemployment in the mean time. All of the stores in our franchise are closing and won't open due to not being paid. Not even the co-owner of the franchise can get a hold of the owner about funds. He can't pay his mortgage. Several people are hurting over this and it is what it is. They're doing what they can to stay afloat in the mean time.

My coworkers and I are young and just starting our professional careers ( 20-22). So my question is, what are the legal ramifications if we continue to never get paid? Obviously there will be a lawsuit, but can the owner just file bankruptcy and never worry about paying us? What are my options, and is there anything I can do to make this easier for anyone who is suffering with me? Most of us live paycheck to paycheck. They all have families to take care of. What can we do to make sure we're making the best out of this shitty situation?

Duplex Destroyed Due to Slumlords,24,dp8z8t,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dp8z8t/duplex_destroyed_due_to_slumlords/,8,1572481081.0,"Hey guys, hoping for some keen legal advice here. (Mauldin, South Carolina)

October 26th, my brother and I came home and all of our home was destroyed due to negligence on our landlords part. The entire ceiling had come down all at once, destroying all our furniture, paintings of mine (I’m a professional artist), kitchen appliances, tv, surround sound, etc. Wish I could post pictures to show just HOW bad this was. We are being treated with no concern, respect or justice after our home was completely wrecked. Here is an itemized list of what has transpired since our shitty duplex was acquired by these people.

——————————————————-

In August 2019, An appraiser / inspector comes to apartment and inspects the home. While there is considerable structural flaws in the home, no repairs or renovations are ever mentioned. (Huge dip in our ceiling was present at the time of inspection)

New Landlords acquires our lease as of August 23rd, 2019

Front Door / ceiling / Roof / Holes in bathroom / water damage in front of duplex all never fixed

AC goes out, we put in a ticket, and it takes two weeks for the AC to be replaced in the hottest weeks of August/September

October 26, 2019 -- Ceiling collapses destroying our living room / kitchen
Estimated cost of damages: $5,650

October 26, 2019 -- landlord sends out cleaning crew, who leave due to lead and asbestos

Tenants across the street say ‘We have not even asked for them to fix up so many issues on our property because we are fearful of the management culture’

October 28, 2019 -- City code enforcement comes to 128 B. Pleasant Drive, and verifies conditions unlivable, then the duplex is condemned

October 28, 2019 -- landlord calls and offers a transfer to 133 B. Pleasant Drive, and we see the apartment with a code enforcement officer

Aforementioned Apartment is unlivable, in poor quality, damages covered up with aesthetic fixes, lacking shower handles, in poor condition, roof damages, no driveway, cracks in the ceiling, and smaller than our previous.

October 28, 2019 -- landlord offers two nights inhotel, and downplays the damages. The owner of 128b. Is in talks with the insurance company and deny liability for damages.

October 29, 2019 -- 10AM Phone call was made to landlord to discover the process of 133 B. Pleasant Drive, Mauldin SC -- property manager says she is getting in contact with the property owner and will let us know by the end of the day

Oct 29, 2019 - 8PM No call back from landlord concerning the update on repairs done to 133 B pleasant drive Mauldin SC

Oct 30, 2019 — Landlords no longer let us speak to property owner and are dodging us hardcore. (Assuming they’re are waiting us out til the end of the month)

—————————————-

They have dealt with us so poorly, we have gotten counsel from the magistrates office, and are just looking for advice! The ENTIRE CEILING crashed down and destroyed everything. We’ve made an itemized list of actual damages and replacement costs including punitive. Just in case we need to go to small claims court. We DO NOT have renters insurance.

Let us know if we have a case or what we can do.

Many of us talked to HR for all different reasons including harassment of employees, talking badly about employees behind our backs, having a bad attitude. We were hoping corporate would take action with him, but it back fired and they decided to let me go for fraternization. They said they’d give me two weeks to find a job, but of course I said no thanks. So anyways, they let me go, but my boyfriend still has his job there. I filed for unemployment and also filed a claim with EEOC. I don’t know if this is a decent enough case. Would like some advice and direction.

My mom passed away and had this box jointly owned by her and my grandmother. I've been told that I need some proof that my grandmother has passed away and that no one has claim to the box. 

Here is the dilemma, my uncle was the executor of my grandma's estate and did some very shady things that were not even right like not making my grandmother a will, taking over her possessions and not splitting them with my mom, not doing probate for the estate, my mom didnt fight any of that due to her own poor health and no financial means to fight my uncle. He even has made his own jewelry made from my grandma's jewelry and so on, he was just shady and I don't want him to have any access to the box. 

What can I do? I am not sure but maybe I'll have to make him aware of it but I really don't want to and dont feel like he should be able to and its probably not that valuable to be honest, neither my mom or grandma had very valuable possessions.",2

Big box retail corporation dragged their feet firing a sexual harassing employee.,0,dpow9i,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dpow9i/big_box_retail_corporation_dragged_their_feet/,12,1572563486.0,"This is more a question out of confusion and curiosity. I am hoping for some insight. 

My husband is a salesman at a nationwide corporate retail store specializing in musical instruments and equipment. There aren’t many of those, so you can easily guess the name of the company. 
 
A coworker of his was known to take photos of female customers with his phone, without their consent. Let’s call him X. He’d take photos of their backside, their cleavage, and would angle the phone to try and take very inappropriate photos. What he did with these photos, we have no idea. 

My husband caught him and reported him multiple times to the store managers. Each time, it was basically considered hearsay. 

One time, a customer caught X taking photos of her, and complained to a manager.  X got off with a warning. 

One of the store managers caught him, told him to delete the photos he just took, and to put his phone away. 

I threatened to make it public that this company kept protecting this guy, but my husband begged me not to for fear of losing his job. 

I don’t know all the details, but I believe X was eventually written up and reprimanded by the regional manager (someone who overseas multiple stores). 

My husband caught X repeating this behavior multiple times since then, and each time he reported it, his manager said to grab a manager, so that the manager can catch him red-handed. For some reason my husband’s word was not enough (to clarify, my husband is a top salesman, extremely ethical and honest, and hardworking- his boss believed him but said his “hands were tied”, and that he was just following direction from the higher-ups). This manager is also a decent guy, always throwing out customers for misconduct (racism, sexism, etc). The manager is not friends with X. X is also not a good worker overall, he is not part of a union, and none of his coworkers could stand him. 

Fast forward to over a year later, the store finally installed security cameras. This time, when X took photos of a female customer, my husband ran to the manager’s office and told the manager to check the cameras. Even then, it was unclear what would happen next. His manager had proof, and presented it to the “higher-ups”. Within a few days, X was finally FIRED. 

When I used to badger my husband about X’s conduct, and how he continued to get away with it for so long, my husband claims that the corporation avoided it because they didn’t want to have any legal issues. This makes absolutely no sense to me, since the company could have potentially faced hundreds of lawsuits if each woman caught him. The threat of that happening surely outweighs the fear of little old X suing the corporation for wrongful termination. 

My question is, how was it so difficult to fire this guy? Any insight would be appreciated!!!

ANSWER: 
Possibly because he is a person of color and the company feared a racial discrimination lawsuit upon termination, which makes complete sense now. It’s the best answer I’ve gotten so far so I’m sticking with it. The company badly needs to diversify their employee base.

As part of the shareholder sale meeting the director advised all shareholders would receive a reduced payout (due to lack of sales - not a fault of the staff) to ensure the company had enough operating capital.

My question is this, can this undetermined amount be taken from the shareholders? And since the funds will go from the buyer to the shareholders direct, can the director demand funds from the paid-out shareholders in return for nothing?",0

Fast forward to payday, and it appears she wasn't paid for any of the vacation time used before her resignation. When she submitted her resignation letter, she received no response, and the following workday all access to her work laptop was removed- thus, she wasn't able to salvage any email history confirming the vacation or even check ADP. 
 
I think the best recourse for her at this point is to file a formal complaint with the Labor Board, but wanted some Reddit advice. Should she reach out directly to HR within the company? Likely not reach out directly to her old boss?",0

(Arizona) Grandparents' Rights for my 16 month-old grandson - Help Needed!!,5,dpfdyf,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dpfdyf/arizona_grandparents_rights_for_my_16_monthold/,20,1572509235.0,"FYI: I live in Arizona, in Gila County. And this may be a long post, but if some of you would take the time to read through it, some helpful information/advice would be sincerely and greatly appreciated.

&#x200B;

My grandson is almost 16 months-old, up until a week ago, he has lived in my home since the day he was born, along with my daughter (his mother). And about 4 weeks after my grandson was born, my mom (his great-grandmother) came to stay with us (specifically, to be able to help with my grandson), so she has also been staying with us almost for the past 15 months. So, since my grandson was born, it has been the 4 of us living in my home. Sadly, for the most part, my grandson's father has not been in the picture; other than sporadic communications with my daughter (which would usually end up in them arguing and fighting and then blocking each other on Facebook and cell phones for weeks or months at a time), and 2 or 3 occasions when he took his son/my grandson to spend time with him for a couple hours. So, in a little over 15 months, since my grandson was born, before last week, he had seen his father on 2 or 3 occasions and spent about 8 hours combined with him.

&#x200B;

Well, my daughter can sometimes be really selfish, foolish and stupid (sorry, not really a better way to put it), and about 10 weeks ago, she apparently got overwhelmed with things at home and she took off and left her son with me and my mom and she has been gone since then. Her son's father somehow found out about this and he decided to contact the courts and then went in and filed paperwork and requested to be granted ""Emergency Temporary Legal Decision Making"" over his son/my grandson. The courts granted him that request last week and I took my grandson to his father last Wednesday, 7 days ago, and he has been with his father since then. This has been the first significant time that my grandson has spent with his father, and it has been the first time he has been away from me and my mom for more than 2-3 days, since he was born.

&#x200B;

I have been nothing but nice and respectful to my grandson's father, and we have gotten along really well, since this happened (he gave me a hug and even broke down and cried when I met him to give his son to him, which was genuinely touching - we do not really know each other, though, since has has not been around). However, he basically hates my daughter (some of that is certainly understandable) and it's tense and uncomfortable to have to listen to him harshly criticize and complain about my daughter. However, because I care about my grandson so much and because I want to keep a good relationship with him, I mostly just let him complain and try to be a voice of reason. Honestly, I just don't want to have to be at the mercy of my grandson's 20 year-old father when it comes to getting to see my grandson, when I have been there for him every day of his life for the past 15-plus months, while he (his father) had only seen him 2-3 times for about 8 hours total. Unfortunately, because of my daughter's selfishness and stupidity, I now currently find myself in this position.

&#x200B;

TO THE POINT OF THIS POST: There is a court date scheduled next week for a hearing about this situation. Being that my daughter is still not home, and appears to not be willing/ready to do what she needs to do to get help and get to this court date, I was planning on going to the court hearing myself and explaining the situation to the judge and asking for some sort of shared custody of my grandson. If possible, I was basically hoping to request 50-50 shared custody of my grandson to be split between me and my grandson's father. And if possible, I would hope that I could basically be granted the custody rights that my daughter would have. Unfortunately, I just called the courthouse where this hearing will take place next week and the person who answered the phone told me that I will not be allowed to speak to the judge during the hearing, because I'm not one of the involved parties (i.e. my daughter or her son's father). And I actually just called back and spoke to the same person and I was told that I could not even write a letter to the judge to be considered for this hearing, because I'm not one of the involved/named/custodial persons.

&#x200B;

So, with this situation described, does anyone have any legal advice about what I can do to try to get some sort of rights to get to see my grandson again? And how quickly might the process move/how soon might I be able to get a court order from a judge stating that I have a legal right to see my grandson? 2-3 weeks? A couple months? 6 months? Longer than that? I know that it's unlikely that anyone can give specific time frames; I'm just trying to get an idea of what the process might be like.

&#x200B;

For the record, I'm relatively young to be a grandfather, 44. And my daughter is currently 22. And my mom is 63, so it's not as though my mom or I are elderly and unable to take good care of my grandson, who will be turning 16 months-old next month. That's actually what we have been doing completely on our own for the past two and-a-half months, after my daughter decided to take off. Also, I was in the hospital about an hour after my grandson was born (I was at work when my daughter went in to labor and have a long commute, or I would have been outside the room when she gave birth), so I am very close to him and I have been a constant in his life, since the day he was born. So I'm trying to point out that we are a close family who are there for one another.

&#x200B;

Since I'm sure that people are curious about why my daughter would do what she did, for starters, she is bipolar, and she is also still immature and irresponsible; and she apparently just had a hard time dealing with the stress of watching her son for 10-12 hours during the daytime (which was how it worked out, as I work nights and my mom would basically watching my grandson from the late-afternoon until the morning, so that my daughter could sleep and be well-rested during the day while watching her son). As I mentioned, my mom/her grandma has been living with us for the past 15 months, since just before my grandson turned one month-old, so my daughter has had lots of help with her son for the past 15 months, despite her son's father having only seen him 2 or 3 times over that time. However, she obviously had a difficult time dealing with the stress that comes with having an energetic baby running around the house and, coupled with other stressors she has in her life, it was apparently too much for her to handle and she decided to take off and leave her son to be taken care of by me and my mom. Which, I would think, would be a testament to how much my daughter trusts me and my mom/her grandma and how she knew that she could count on us to take good care of him.

&#x200B;

To be honest, I am definitely very disappointed in my daughter and also very pissed off at her, because this is entirely her fault for creating this situation and she did not need to take off and leave, like she did. What she did was incredibly selfish and unreasonable and frustrating. It has made life much harder for me and my mother, as we have had to watch her son all day, every day, since she left, over 10 weeks ago. However, we have managed and we have been happy to get to spend so much time with my grandson. Now that we have not seen my grandson in a week, though, my mom and I are both really sad, to the point of feeling depressed, because we are so used to having him around us all the time. Plus, we worry about him missing us, as we have both been there almost every day since he was born. We worry about him wondering where we are and being sad and lonely, and what he may be thinking. And, we worry about him forgetting about us, if we don't get him back in our lives soon.

&#x200B;

While I'm posting this, it's making me get emotional, so I'll say that my daughter really fucked up and that I resent her right now, because of how much I miss my grandson. I'm sure that some of you are already thinking this, and you're right, being that my daughter is bipolar and was really stressed, she has definitely been self-medicating with meth and has basically been doing nothing but fucking her life up over these past 10 weeks, since she left. Also, I don't think that my daughter deserves to be around her son right now, and that's not what I am trying to make happen. To be honest, I am trying to figure out how to get my daughter arrested as I've been typing this. It's just not as easy as it should/could be, because you have to worry about causing problems for other people, especially, if they're willing to try to help you have your child arrested and taken to jail.

&#x200B;

Basically, I want to try to find out what I need to do to get the most out of whatever Grandparents' Rights I may have here in Arizona. I have been there for my grandson basically every day of his life and and I love him, care about how and miss him very much and I want him back in my life as soon as possible. So, if someone can help me get pointed in the right direction about exercising my Grandparents' Rights, that would be great information to have.

&#x200B;

Also, what would I need to do to try to petition the courts for actual (shared) custody of my grandson? If possible, I would like to (at least, temporarily) be granted the custody of my grandson that my daughter has had. I'm hoping that she will get arrested soon and then be forced to get treatment, inpatient treatment, if possible, which is a realistic possibility, as she is on probation and I am in contact (and on good terms) with her PO. I don't want her son's father to end up with full custody of their son, as, not only do I want to be sure to get to continue to be a significant part of his life, I also don't think that his father deserves/has earned that honor and privilege. Yes, he seems to have made great efforts to grow up and become a better young man and to try to work on being a father, and I do genuinely respect and appreciate that; but he's had his son for one week out of almost 16 months, while my mom and I have been with him for those other 65-70 weeks and I would like to think that we should have built up some equity when it comes to some sort of custody power and a legal right to see my grandson.

&#x200B;

Speaking of her son's father, he, too, is young (20, I believe), and has struggled with poor decision-making and drugs and has also been in jail. He's actually been arrested and in jail since their son was born and when he was not a part of his son's life, so it's not like he grew up immediately and started making good choices as soon as he found out that my daughter was pregnant. I don't know a lot about him, as I think that he and my daughter just hung out for a few weeks/months (and probably did drugs together) and had a fling and she got pregnant, and then they had a falling out and ended up going separate ways. I recall him talking shit to my daughter for weeks/months, claiming that her son wasn't his, like many young jackasses do. The paternity process took several months, so there were many months where he contributed nothing towards his son, while I was the person supporting his son and making sure that he had a safe place to live. Which was the case, since the day he was born. And which I didn't mind doing; but I don't want him to be portrayed as being someone who always wanted to be a great father and who was trying to be there since the day he was born, because that was not the case. For most of the first 15 months of his son's life, he's been a selfish fuck-up who did almost nothing for his son, and only paid child support, after the courts started forcing him to/started taking it out of his paychecks.

&#x200B;

Before I get sidetracked and make this post even longer than it already is, I want to be sure to point out that my grandson's father absolutely seems to have legitimately grown up, matured, gotten off drugs, stayed in compliance with his probation, and decided that he wants to be a father to his son/my grandson. And that's a fucking great thing. I don't know the kid very well, but I'm proud of him and thankful that he has chosen to become a better person and to work on being a father and to be there for his son/my grandson.

&#x200B;

With that said, you might ask, why do I not just communicate with my grandson's father about visitation with my grandson, or even sharing custody of my grandson with him? Well, I had been talking to him about that over the past week, and everything has been nice and friendly and respectable, and he had been texting with me about my grandson and sending me pictures and videos of him almost every day, which was awesome. And he had specifically said that he was not trying to take my grandson away from us, and that he appreciates what we had done for him since he was born. He mentioned this multiple times, so he realizes that we have been there for his son and done a lot for him. However, yesterday, apparently, my daughter or her boyfriend apparently texted him a bunch of messages and talked a bunch of shit to him about what's going on, and he thinks that I may have had something to do with my daughter/her boyfriend being pissed off and reaching out to him, so the last message he sent was him saying that he he was sorry, but that he could not continue to message me about my grandson.

&#x200B;

So, with the court hearing being a week away, I want to start trying to formulate a plan about what I could, and should, be doing to get my grandson back in my and my mother's life. Honestly, I am hoping that my daughter gets arrested and is in jail today, because I think that's part of what will cause her son's father to not want to let their son come stay with me in my home, because he's afraid that she might show up while high and try to take him or cause some problem. So, if my daughter is in jail, it should help my situation with my grandson. And, to be honest, right now, my daughter belongs and jail and needs to get clean and start getting the help she needs.

&#x200B;

Also, I called a local attorney's office right before I started typing this (or maybe it was after I had started it) and I have a free consultation scheduled for next week, the day before the court date. I'm hoping to get some valuable and helpful information from that consultation; but, in the meantime, if there's anything I can be doing to help my case, I'd like to be doing it.

&#x200B;

If nothing else, does anyone know if it would be worth me making the drive to attend this court hearing next week? The courthouse is in another city and is about 80 miles each way, so I don't want to drive 160 miles for no reason. Is it, at least, \*possible\* that the judge \*might\* allow me to speak during the hearing and state my case and be willing to listen to what I have to say and take it in to consideration? Or, was the woman right, and, since I'm not one of the involved parties, I will definitely not even be allowed to speak during the hearing?

&#x200B;

Also, should I start looking online, or run up to the local Superior Court building, to try to find some Grandparents' Rights forms to start filling out? And are Grandparents' Rights relatively less-important/significant than actual parental rights? If I just have to pursue whatever Grandparents' Rights I have available in Arizona, is that realistically just something that might allow me to see my grandson a couple weekends each year? Or can I actually be granted significant time with my grandson, where I could be allowed to have him for a week out of every month or two?

&#x200B;

Realistically, I have been the only male figure in my grandson's life since he was born, and I have been there for him every day. Is this going to count for anything in the eyes of the courts/a judge? I am hoping that a judge might see how much I was willing/happy to do for my grandson, while his father was still out fucking around and denying his son and trying to avoid having to pay child support for him. I'm hoping that a judge will realize that I have shown that I truly care about my grandson and that I should be considered deserving of continuing to be a major part of his life. I also want to say, I don't want to make things ugly, tense or stressed between myself and my grandson's father, so I want to try to be as respectable and kind as possible. Because I just want my grandson to be loved and taken care of and to have good, caring people who love him around him.

&#x200B;

Btw, I called the local Superior Court and was told that I have to download the Grandparents' Rights form from a different county's website and then amend them and that they will accept them in Gila County. I was also told that the fee to file these forms in court is around $165. Is that reasonable?

&#x200B;

I am seriously sorry for making this post so long. I realize that I will likely have prevented lots of people from actually reading this post, before of how long it is. And I am sorry about that. I was just trying to be detailed and thorough, and I kept thinking of shit to mention, and I got carried away. IF anyone actually reads this entire post, please know that I would be genuinely grateful for any helpful advice and information that I get! Thank you.

The day that we were supposed to meet up, she did not follow up with me on where to meet. 

It has now been a week since I was supposed to meet up with her and she has ignored all my (polite) messages on instagram asking if we can still meet up. I know she has been active on Instagram because of her posts but i don’t understand why she’s unresponsive to me now.

The reason I need this passport is because it’s a foreign passport and I have no other form of documentation to get a new one. I live in the US as a permanent resident and my passport is Mexican.

Three men entered my apartment as inspectors but then proceeded to announce themselves as “Immigration”.,1320,dotb65,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dotb65/three_men_entered_my_apartment_as_inspectors_but/,69,1572399813.0,"I’m currently renting an apartment in a small condominium in Florida, and I’ve been living here for almost 3 years.

However, they were not able to actually get to my apartment until today. I was not physically present when they came, but I do have cameras set up, which I was monitoring.  As the men entered the apt, one of them proceeded to announce themselves as “Immigration”. They then went around taking pictures and filming everything within the apt while they also took notes. After about 15-20 minutes of inspecting, they left. I immediately messaged my landlord and asked who these men were and why they declared themselves that way. All he responded is that they were inspectors and not immigration.
 
The way I see it, either my landlord is lying, or one of these men falsely impersonated a federal officer. Either way, I’d like to know what I can do about it and if I have any legal recourse in this matter. Also, is it legal for them to film my property within the apartment?

It's not just a couple quick knocks, it's 20-30 harsh pounds that sound like a hammer and I cannot figure out what noise they could be hearing. 

The apartment is carpeted and I have rugs on top of it. I'm 5'2 and about 110lbs so it's not like I'm stepping on this carpet like an elephant. I do have a dog that was approved at move in by management, and though he's about 40lbs he doesn't jump and very rarely barks (I know this because I have a nanny cam with sound and check on him frequently). And if he does bark the neighbor doesn't knock then, they only knock when someone is walking. 

I have neighbors above and on both sides of me and aside from the occasional loud door slam I have never ever heard them walk. 

I've tried confronting them but when I go down and knock they won't answer their door. 

What can I do to be proactive about this situation? Should I be calling the landlord when they bang on their ceiling? My biggest fear is them lodging a bunch of noise complaints against me despite not making any noise beyond what would be expected of someone just living their life. Thanks for any advice.",4

HR Claims Offer Was A Mistake,35,dp63fk,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dp63fk/hr_claims_offer_was_a_mistake/,9,1572467599.0,"A friend told me about a situation at his job last week, and I'm curious to get some other people's opinion on it. HR told him that the initial offer letter was a mistake and that he's actually only entitled to half of the promised annual bonus and none of some RSU's in the initial offer. They're keeping his salary the same. The total hit to his compensation is mid five figures. He can cover his rent, bills, etc. out of his salary, and has been since he started there back in January, but he budgeted to have this as a big lump sum into his savings and so this puts him in a bad spot financially.

I suggested he lawyer up and start putting together an exit strategy, but he's being very timid about the whole thing. He thinks, in the long run, this is a good place to work and insists he can resolve it by talking to HR or his boss. Am I wrong for thinking this is a terrible idea? For thinking that a job that takes tens of thousands of dollars from you after you've started working is not a good place to work? Is there any reason NOT to talk to an attorney right now (e.g. this sort of thing is clearly legal, even though it might suck for him)?

My best friend's daughter was murdered in Mexico and we need advice to bringing his other daughter back home to North Carolina,19,dp85ef,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dp85ef/my_best_friends_daughter_was_murdered_in_mexico/,13,1572477481.0,"So, this is no easy post to write but I thought it might be a good direction to turn to ask for advice. 

My best friend (Stephen) currently lives in North Carolina, his daughters and their mother live with her grandparents in Mexico. Two nights ago, his 14 year old daughter was beat to death in the streets by 4 grown men. As of right now, not many details are known but we do know we have to get his youngest daughter back to the US, and here's why. 

1. Mother of their children left for Mexico with her parents and never told or asked Stephen.

2. Right now no contact has been made with the mother of the children and she has not been seen since before the brutality. 

3. His youngest daughter had previously over heard her mother on the phone asking people for ""ice"" which is slang for meth. 

4. His youngest daughter is very terrified and needs her father. 

Here are some other details that might save some questions and answers: 

1. They do not have a custody agreement in order but he is on their birth certificates. 

2. He cannot go over the border because he is a felon so that process might get even more complicated with a language barrier and the danger concerning his safety since there are still unanswered questions regarding his daughters murder. 

3. Hiring a lawyer that could help with this is going to be thousands of dollars definitely because it does involve another country, we are looking into it but we are just ordinary restaurant workers that try hard enough to get by day to day. 

Any advice on what I can do to help him, or any advice that could be left for him would be much appreciated. I am hoping with the help of legal smarts on here we can get pointed in the right direction to bring his other daughter back home where she belongs. 

Thank you in advance,

I was told I can apply for fmla and short term disability so I don't lose a ton of wages.

I'm released from the hospital with nothing but a discharge form. I have a follow up appointment with the trauma clinic on the 24th. 2 people at the hospital said the trauma clinic would fill out my leave forms. A pcp would fill out for short term disability.

Today, the 30th I have a pcp appointment, I have ptsd and a phobia of doctors. So I don't have a primary care. I don't usually need to be seen for medical conditions. The people I scheduled the appointment with said they could fill the paperwork out without an issue.

I go to my appointment today, the doctor fills out the short term disability, and gives me a doctor's note saying I can return back to work on the 4th. But turns around and says she won't fill out the fmla form!!! And my work does not accept doctors notes. 

'The surgeon has to do it', was what I was told next. The surgeon and trauma clinic says they will not cover more than 7 days of healing. I found this out on day 10. (I was supposed to be given an in nformational packet and was not, and no one spoke to me about the length of time I had off of work).

 In order to be covered past 7 days, I have to take it up with my pcp! Who refused to fill out the paperwork because ""she just doesn't fill out flma or leave paperwork. Besides, she doesn't even know me. This is my first appointment with her"". So the trauma clinic, the surgeon, and the pcp will not fill out my leave paperwork. I was told to consider going back to work early (today was the first day I could hold my own weight). 

Or to try and find another pcp that will file my paperwork. I have 1 day to do this. I'm lost in limbo living my worst nightmare. They seem more worried with legal matters than whether im covered for an emergency surgery. I told them I'm not a machine I'm sorry I'm not healing on their schedule. I told my HR department and I'm dreading their response tomorrow.

* Disassemble ALL self assembled furniture

* Find arrangements for any pets

Living in Hoboken, New Jersey, I was hit by someone who is not insured and was driving her mother's car. She hit me, it was her fault as she pulled out into oncoming traffic. She claimed at the time of the accident to police her insurance had ""just lapsed"" and was given a day to get it reinstated (which did not happen, she has not been insured since September 2019). 
My insurance has reached out to her, at which point she yelled at them they were not allowed to call her and hung up. I find out from the police report that it is her mother's uninsured car, not hers. 
The police did not tow the car, as they should have from what I understand? 
My insurance tells me the best course of action is to file a claim with them and my rates will most likely increase. I will also have to pay my deductible. 
It's mind blowing to me that she gets out of this with a ticket and I am left with no rental car (my policy doesn't cover it), a damaged car, and no recourse. Because NJ is a ""no fault"" state.

My question is: does the fact that I own my unit change anything? Of course, I understand that the dog would need to pass through the hallway and elevator.

The end of the year neared, and I scheduled a week long vacation since I haven't taken a vacation yet. My boss notified me that he was only going to pay me for 2 of my vacation days because since he was not with me while I was working, he could not verify that I worked the appropriate amount of hours (this confuses me because I'm not hourly). All the days I worked from home he considered me ""not working"" and paid me out of my vacation time to ""make up for going over"" my sick days.

Now I know an employer can use vacation time in place of sick time if they notify the employee, however I was not notified that he was doing that, nor was I ""not working"" on those days. I completed my work from home, yet my vacation time was taken from me.

Is this legal? If not, is there some for of action I can take to protect my wages?

I pushed my sister 1st then she pushed me and then I pushed her one last time before she started swinging on me. My mom tried to break us up for literally 1 second and then called the cops. My mom ended up telling the cops that when she tried to break us up, I tried to push forward but it was my sister who was the one trying to push past her to get to me. During the fight I was pushing my sister off me and telling her to back off but she keep on coming after me. Me and my sister have had multiple fights in the past and legally this would be my 3rd offense. I ended up going to juvie and even some of the staff there told me I shouldn't have been there. No one really got injured in the fight besides me having a scratch on my neck that didn't even break the skin. During my stay at Juvie, I had a drug test and tested positive for Marijuana. This was my 1st offense with Marijuana and i have court tomorrow. My mom is trying to get me into placement even though it's not needed and I'm not trying to go to placement. Is there anything that I can do to avoid going to placement? I am completely fine with probation, i just don't want to go to placement. I need help fast, my court date is tomorrow and it's at 9, what can i do to avoid going to placement?

Edit: I have no prior history of drug use and my last offense was during 2017. I have no record of using any drugs

Edit 2: This may seem like I'm trying to defend my actions which is not my intention, I realize I am in the wrong because I pushed my sister 1st and I have a prior record for violence. I am not trying to justify my actions, I am just trying to avoid placement because places like that don't help me in the slightest and it would affect my social life, school life, and my mental health. I already beat myself up enough for the actions I've committed and there's not a single day that goes by without me hating myself. I just want to have a semi normal life and find productive ways to help me instead of wasting my time in placement, I've already been in therapy since i was 5 so most of the things they might teach me there I already know",0
Roommate Drama,2,dphb43,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dphb43/roommate_drama/,3,1572518120.0,"Washington State:

Sorry if this got muddled. I am an emotional wreck writing this. I'll cut it down if it seems too wordy, when I've had more time to breathe. The psychological toll my roommate has done to me over the course of the past year has ripped me to absolute shreds. 😔 Today, my soul is left with just one last thread.

This all went down at 2pm today:

My roommate is threatening to move out in a week and leave without paying rent for November and has yet to pay utilities. I am 100% fine with him moving out, but not ok paying for his half. We are on a month to month written contract with our property management. We have joint responsibilities that he is weaseling out of. This place needs cleaning bad in order to get a new roommate in here. The mess is his just as much as it is mine, but he's now refusing to pitch in to clean/pay for it. I can't do all of this myself, especially with my severe arthritis. (I can do manual work only for so long until I get excruciating pain that lasts hours or sometimes days.) I definitely will need to hire someone in the short amount of time I will have to find someone new. Since he is moving out so quick and leaving me to pay and care for everything myself, I will be losing out on a lot of money. Money I need to survive on. 

I *did* owe him money, which has been partially paid off. (I was able to pay him over time by not charging him utilities. He didn't pay utilities for several months, but when I lost my job, I asked him to start paying for utilities again. This was a while ago, not recently.)

He recently waived the debt for me. A week or so ago, when we were on good terms, he said that I no longer had to worry about that debt. I stupidly got this promise in verbal form only. He has a bad habit of ""forgetting"" things he has said or promised, so of course he calls me a loon later on and ""doesn't remember"" what he promised. (On top of that, he regularly gaslights in order to make me *feel* like a loon! I usually see through his bullshit, but he's so talented at gaslighting that the constant denying often throws me over an edge!)  Now he wants the money and claims he never promised to waive the debt. I'm not sure how I could even prove that this debt was forgiven by him since it was all said verbally. 😔

We have been fighting off and on for many months, but we have also been trying to salvage our friendship. Today was the end of everything though. We got into a huge fight today, one involving police. It was the big fight that has officially ended our friendship. In a fit of rage, he threw a heavy metal lamp at me, at very close range, in hopes to brutally hit me. It missed me by only a few inches. Instead of hitting me, it hit a wooden table and then the glass door. I'm surprised the door didn't shatter with the amount of force he used. I called the police, but he was able to convince the police what an ""upstanding guy he was!"" He manipulated and convinced the cops that he was the victim, and it actually worked! Think Eric Cartman. The police believed him over me. I heard the policeman tell him he believed him. I couldn't believe my ears, I nearly broke down in tears right there. I get a lamp thrown at me and the police believe he's innocent. He was even ""smart"" enough to put the metal lamp neatly away in a box, prior to police arrival, to make it appear like I was crazy and lying. Go figure. Anyways, sorry, I got lost in that sad mini rant... 😔

He's demanding I pay him back or he's going to take me to small claims. He is leaving in a week or less and doesn't want to pay his half of the rent for November, despite us being on a month to month contract. He has yet to pay utilities as well. I do have a verbal contract with him that my debt to him was forgiven, but now he's acting like he never promised that. So what do I do?",2

(WA) Nursing home not paying doctor!,3,dpfhbu,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dpfhbu/wa_nursing_home_not_paying_doctor/,0,1572509622.0," 

Location: Washington state

Thanks for the advice, hopefully this isn't too long. I will try to include all relevant details.

Over the last 14 months I worked as an independent contractor at a nursing home. My position was medical director (I am a physician) which basically meant being on call for any nursing or patient related question 24/7, going into the nursing home 5 days a week to see patients, being involved in administrative work at the nursing home, etc. It was not an easy job and I spent 30-45 hours a month AT LEAST on top of my other job performing medical director duties. I had no social life whatsoever.

Over the last 6 months, I had several late payments by the nursing home (per contract they can pay me two months late, so we are talking late payments past 2 months). The last 3 months, every payment was late, often by weeks. I began to feel taken advantage of. I wrote the CEO and administrator a nice email saying that if they continue to pay me late, I will consider it a breach of contract (this is all described in the contract) and gave a 30 day notice as described in the contract if contract was breached. Of course, the next month I did not receive my payment as of the 1st of the month (essentially 2 months late, which was allowed by contract). I call the administrator and asked where my payment was. Was given a lot of excuses which I won't go into, none of them legit. The CEO personally called and asked me what it would take to stay on the job and I stated I wanted payment by the end of the week (4 business days) but was told that was not possible. The nursing home is doing VERY well, the administrator showed me at one point a few months ago that they were bringing in > 300,000 dollars per month.

Of note, I did not abandon my patients at the nursing home when I quit and provided emergency call until they found a replacement which was a couple of days later. I was called multiple times.

I have since tried calling, emailing, and texting the CEO who has not responded. This is a substantial amount of money; two months that I spent countless hours on patient care/administration work.....all for FREE!

My question is this, I was an independent contractor not an employee. There is nothing in the contract about legal fees if this goes to court. It is well over the limit for small claims. I do not know if there is a state entity I can report them to or if I will have to take on the burden to sue the company where I worked. I have definitely learned a lot of important lessons from this.",3

Anyways, I have a close friend who I go to school with and he is stuck living with his mentally abusive aunt and an uncle that does nothing about it.  He was forced to move from his parents house in Utah due to his step mom being mentally and physically abusive towards him and his step siblings, so he chose to live with his aunt and uncle because he was unable to move in with his grandparents and now the situation is slightly better but still very far from good.  We are now currently living in Las Vegas, Nevada.  He has been living with them for a little over a year now and this has done quite a number on him.  His aunt doesn't allow him to use the internet and monitor everything he does and if he does do something, they threaten him with sending him back to his parents home in Utah which is far worse.  She has done far more than what was just said and she has basically just taken control over his life and favors his cousin over him and any time the cousin does something bad, they blame him for the misbehavior or they suspect he was the culprit.  He has tried to seek therapy, however, after his first session with his therapist, the aunt proceeded to approach the therapist and demand to know what exactly he said to her in detail and this is very illegal and so the therapist declined and she pulled him out of therapy.  She has restricted him to their house and only lets him go out if it is to do things with his cousin and on the off chance that they let him go to someones house, he is only able to stay for 3 hours at most.  These may be minor things but there has been much more that she has done to him and it has caused a very large mental toll on him to the point where he has contemplated suicide and sees no future for himself until he is free from his family.  He has researched emancipation in the state of Nevada and he is unable to do this unless he is either married or living away from his legal guardians and this is not possible due to his aunts insatiable control over him and so this is not a possible option.  I really want to help him because it hurts me to see him put up a front when he is in public and be this out going, funny, and loving guy and when he gets home, he does nothing but cry.  I also don't believe that CPS would be the greatest option considering the conditions of foster homes in this state.  Is there anything I would be able to do to help him?",2

"Our landlords are doing some very shady things, desperately need advice.",1,dpjdgc,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dpjdgc/our_landlords_are_doing_some_very_shady_things/,3,1572530311.0,"This is going to be a longer post and I'm on mobile so bear with me.  Sorry in advance!

Last October my girlfriend and I moved into an apartment complex in Florida.  The landlords sold us on this apartment saying everything has been completely renovated with brand new carpet and the works. The first thing we noticed when we got the keys (wouldn't let us do a walk through before moving in because new carpet was being put in.  lol) was the smell of mildew and it was 90 degrees inside.  The hot water heater had been leaking into the carpet, and into the carpet in the adjacent room    it took them hours on our first day to send someone to clean it.  We started noticing black mold all through the apartment and the worst was the apartment upstairs, which had a toilet directly above ours, had a bad seal that leaked into the ceiling.  A bubble formed in the ceiling from their flushing and if we so happened to be on the toilet when they flushed, well you can guess what rained down on us.  We sent work order after work order to have them fix it, and finally they sent someone out to look at it who took one look at the ceiling, said he was going to get his tools and never came back.  Months went by before we were able to get someone out to look at it who fixed the leak but didn't repair the ceiling and said they would fix it when we moved out.  I had no intentions on staying and have been working on trying to find somewhere new to move when our lease was up.  

We finally found somewhere new and actually clean for cheaper.  On the day that the new land lord attempted to get in touch with our current one (they never even called him back to talk to him about us) we find a note on our door saying that our lease was ending in 3 weeks and that if we didn't give them a 60 days notice that we were leaving that they would switch us to a month to month lease and raising our rent 200 dollars.  I went to the office and basically asked what they were trying to imply with this, and the new management said she wouldn't charge me for a whole month, just for 15 days at our current rate.  Still 400$ for 2 weeks where we won't even be in the same town.  I had been in touch with our land lord about our situation saying we were planning on moving out if we could find somewhere affordable and closer to my school, and she said that was fine and to just keep in touch with her.  She never asked for a written statement or anything!  She doesn't even work here anymore because they had to sell off the property to new management because the whole place is a dump.  

On top of this, going back in our system we found that every single one of our work orders had been deleted except for one which didn't have us bitching about mgmt.  Up until recently, all of our work orders were still in the system!  Including the ones that had been ""completed""!  The scathing ones are ALL GONE except for one where I was somewhat friendly to them. They deleted all the ones that complained about the leaks, the mold and even the ceiling damage.  

I'm just really worried that on top of them trying to weasel us out another months rent that we won't even be there, that we won't even get our deposit back despite keeping the apartment immaculately clean where we could.  We didn't put a single dent in the wall yet the place is full of black mold and a sunken ceiling from the toilet.  Our management also didn't do a walk-through with us or give us any paper work about the current move in condition, which makes me even more worried.  They've gone through different management twice since we've moved in on top of this. 

I've spoken to my family and they've basically said that I should threaten to file a complaint with the health department but I just wanted some other opinions.  This is my first time living on my own and just lost.  Our neighbors are even facing the same problem with their bathroom ceiling being sunken and raining filth when the upstairs people flush their toilets.

What can I do?  I can't afford to be paying the new rent and then a half month for the old one.  I'm terrified they won't give me back my 800$ deposit even tho my girlfriend and I kept the place spotless, not even any spills on the carpet.  I just feel trapped and it's messed up the old management didn't say anything about a written notice of leaving.  

Again I'm sorry if this is hard to read, I've been packing all day and preparing to finally get out of this dump.  Any help would be greatly appreciated",1

After checking that the oven was off and none of the electrical outlets had obvious signs of burning I called the emergency maintenance number, straight to voicemail 5 times in a row... at this time my smoke detectors went off so I flipped the main breaker, evacuated my pets and girlfriend, then called the fire department. The fire department identified the source as the air handler and noted that the air filter was visibly caked with dust (maintenance is supposed to come monthly to change the filter as stated in our lease agreement). After waiting for the office to open and filling out a maintenance request I had the air handler looked at. The maintenance guy said that the power relay had shorted out and burned, this was a common occurrence with these units and they kept spare parts on hand to fix the issue. I asked the maintenance guy if there was anything that could be done to prevent it from happening again and I was told that ""this is a known issue with these air handlers and was bound to happen sooner or later"".

TL;DR air handler caught on fire in my apartment but it happens all the time. 

So my question is, do I have any footing in demanding the air handler be replaced or breaking my lease to live somewhere safer? 

We are buying a home soon and plan to leave in February but I don't feel safe leaving my pets alone with this fire hazard while we're at work. It's also worth noting that even with smoke detectors going off and a fire truck in front of the building, none of my neighbors noticed what was happening.

Downstairs neighbors at apartment complex called police on me for walking around in my apartment late (apparently the floors are thin),71,dp2y9y,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dp2y9y/downstairs_neighbors_at_apartment_complex_called/,56,1572445867.0,"Raleigh, NC:

People who live below me in my apartment complex have constantly made noise complaints about me walking around in my apartment late at night.  It started initially just by a guy who lived below me who used to come up in the middle of the night (after midnight) and knock on my door for walking around and telling me he was trying to sleep.  I put a stop to that quickly by informing the apartment complex manager that my downstairs neighbor was knocking on my door after midnight and it made me feel uncomfortable.  

So, I just got a knock on my door from two police officers who were from the local police department and told me that the neighbors downstairs are trying to sleep and they had gotten a noise complaint.   This happened right around 1:30 AM.

Am I not allowed to walk around in my own damn residence?   I have a tendency to pace around while I am on the phone, and I was on an important hour and 41 minute phone call that I had to end...due to the damn police knocking on my door.

Just to confirm, in the event that the people below me lie to my apartment complex manager (yet again) about what happened, I called the police back, and recorded the conversation (which is completely legal in NC, btw, as long as one party gives consent to said recording, which was me, in this case).   They confirmed over the phone that the notes from the officers did confirm that it was only footsteps and walking around and nothing else.

Can the police even tell me that I'm not allowed to walk around in my own apartment?   There is nothing in the lease that says anything along the lines of not being allowed to ""walk"" or move about my apartment during certain times of day.  

I get the feeling that after other issues I've had with the people below me, that sadly, this may start to escalate out of control.   I recently installed a Nest security camera recording 24/7 to the cloud that can protect me in the event that the people below me try to lie or state something happened or didn't happen going forward.

I need some legal advice here on what to do and how to proceed in the event that my apartment community tries to take negative action on me for simply walking around, which in my opinion, is a violation of my civil rights.  Additionally, if the police are ever called on me again for simply walking around, what should I say to them?   I am not going to be told that I am not allowed to walk in my own god-damned apartment, especially while I'm on an important phone call with our team from China for work.",71

He also does not include our pay rate or hours on pay stubs. Just gross, net pay, and taxes withheld. He has also manipulated costs for building equipment at the resort. I’ve looked at the cost of our cabins and it costs around $30,000 to build one, he reported that it costs over $150,000.  He provides housing for employees, too, charging 250 a month per person living in a cabin. But he has raised it to 300 since the winter has started, not knowledgeable about tenant rights. My overall experience here has been negative. I do get 50% off in our restaurant and 20% off in the convenient store. But those are the only employee benefits I receive other than housing. I was also almost fired because he left me in the air on a piece of equipment and it started to fall(it would’ve eventually slid off causing me to fall over 40 feet) so I call another employee to help bring my back to the ground.

They originally told us that utilities were going to be charged separately from our rent. As in on the first rent is due, then some time later in the month utilities would be charged. 
 
But the problem with this is that they have not charged any of us for utilities since signing. I thought maybe that I had miss heard/read the contract, and that utilities was included with rent. And now this week they have given us a notice, that in short says ""hey we forgot to charge you for utilities, you have to pay by January 1st"". So any help here would be greatly appreciated.

CA - Who is liable for medical bill after arrest,1,dpj4ls,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dpj4ls/ca_who_is_liable_for_medical_bill_after_arrest/,1,1572528615.0,"5 years ago I was arrested for a DUI and the officer chose to use a k9 on me. I’ll spare you my thoughts on that and just get to the point. After being arrested I was taken to a hospital to be “medically cleared” for jail and also to have my blood drawn for evidence. I was given a shot for tetanus (I believe) and the bites were treated (sort of) and then I was taken to jail. This month I was alerted that I had a debt sent to collections. It was for this hospital visit. I called the hospital to inquire as to how I am responsible for this debt and they insisted that I am, even though no effort was made on their part to inform me or bill me or contact me whatsoever - side note I’ve had the same phone number and address this whole time. During the call I was told that I owe $941 but the collection agency states I owe $1216. Am I responsible for this debt or should the city/county be liable for it as I was in custody and taken to the hospital without my consent.
The derogatory mark has had a big negative impact on my credit score and I want to do all I can to best rectify it. 

In short:

Location: Ohio

So this is a long story but essentially what it boils down to is two VERY close friends of mine were allegedly involved in a incredibly obscure criminal enterprise, victimless, not drug related, and something most people laugh out when told about but regardless they were caught and arrested for this crime.

I just got a call from one of them just to let me know they got their discoveries back and I was named as a suspect... Now I wasn't involved in this alleged enterprise but I did allegedly have full and total knowledge of it, they ran it out of their apartment that I had been to a million times, I knew what was going on and never said anything. 

More background info, their bails after arrest were posted at $50k/each I was able to post their bond as I knew the safe combo because it was my old safe and they had enough money in it for me to go post it, I am the sole signature on their bond as I didn't want to tell their parents. They both stayed at my house until the police said they could move back into their place the next day, etc. 

They were both arrested 11mo ago, I have since graduated and started a career about 800 miles away but I am still incredibly concerned about my name being on this form. What is my recourse to have it removed? How scared should I be currently? I am honestly pretty upset I worked my ass off got my actual dream job and now this happens.",4

After several months of physical therapy she still had limited use of the arm and it's significant pain. The workers comp company finally approved surgery.  At the two week checkup,  the surgeon approved return to work on light duty.

It appears that standard return to work time  for this type of repair is 4 to 6 weeks and driving a car is not recommended until 6 weeks. 
She still having significant pain, for which she is prescribed narcotics and muscle relaxers, which leave her pretty loopy and uncoordinated. 
She currently has trouble even dressing herself, nevermind more complex actions.

However the workers comp company has told her that they will stop paying for time off because the surgeon has approved return to work. Payment for recovery time will only resume if her job replies that they have no light duty or her pain management doctor (separate from the surgeon),  says that she cannot work. It will be another week before she gets to see the pain management doctor again.

She fears that she'll be told to return to work before she's capable of actually working and will be stuck with no income. She has no savings to speak of, so that situation cannot really be ridden out.

Getting legal aid for dealing with workers comp with little to no finances seems like it would be difficult. Would one of those ""no fee if no recovery"" personal injury lawyers be a good option at this point, or would they only be interested in pressing civil suit with an eventual payoff?",1

Troubles with a non-compete,2,dpg983,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dpg983/troubles_with_a_noncompete/,0,1572513162.0,"\-This all takes place in Tennessee

\-Signed a non-compete with Company A upon joining. Wording of non-compete was brief and general.

\-Received offer from badass new Company B: significantly higher pay, benefits, opportunities, etc.

\-Without getting too specific, working for Company B could technically be considered a violation of the non-compete; the non-compete specifies that I am not allowed to work for ""a company of this type"" which Company B technically is

\-However, Company B deals with an entirely different type of product as Company A. It is an entirely different set of customers/prospects. I would not be bringing over any existing customers or calling on the same types of customers as I was at Company A (which is the primary purpose of the non-compete). I did not receive any special training from Company A, and I would not be taking over any trade secrets.

\-Given all this I thought it unlikely that Company A would think it worth it to spend time money and resources pursuing me, but I did want 100% peace of mind.

\-Upon receiving offer from Company B, I asked if they could include in my contract a clause that they would provide legal assistance in the unlikely event that Company A decided to sue or send a cease and desist.

\-They were not willing to put that in my contract, but they said I could send over a copy of my non-compete for their legal department to look over and assure me that it was safe to go ahead and quit.

\-I sent it over and immediately regretted doing so. Still waiting to hear back from Company B. Still working for Company A, and nobody there is aware that I am trying to leave (hence the throwaway)

\-Also I formally accepted their offer, but again, they are still processing the non-compete and have been for two full business days now.

\-My question is: have I, by providing the non-compete, made Company B liable if they hire me knowing that I would be breaching a non-compete? They knew about it before, but does having it in writing in front of their legal department somehow change things? Will they require that I get a waiver from Company A?

Non-convicted charges and background check reporting,1,dpisd2,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dpisd2/nonconvicted_charges_and_background_check/,1,1572526428.0,"I'm in the process of prepping for an interview with a company will require an extensive background check.  I received two MIP charges for underage drinking while in college (>7yrs ago) in both instances the charges were deferred and I was not convicted.

My understanding is under the Fair Credit Reporting Act non-convicted offenses are reportable for up to 7 years, under federal law.  Michigan state law prohibits employers from asking applicants about misdemeanor arrests not resulting in conviction. After doing some research it appears the definition of 'conviction' in relation to FCRA is interpreted under federal law, which would include a guilty plea and dismissal constituting a conviction ([Aldaco v. Rentgrow](https://www.isba.org/cases/7thcircuit/2019/04/16/aldacovrentgrowinc)).  Would the third party conducting the background check be entitled to respect the state laws associated with the reporting of non-convicted charges? Also, the company I will be interviewing with is out of state, because the offenses occured in Michigan, would I still be protected? I'm concerned there would be no way of having 100% certainty that the charges would not be reported on a background check.  Would expungement be the best course of action?

I ran a criminal history report through the state of Michigan, background check through a third party company, both came up clean. Additionally, spoke to a lawyer at a government agency, who also claims there is no record.

Basically, I was accosted by these two people that had sneaked into my (locked) apartment building who were telling me that I was being overcharged for my electric bill. They said they worked ""for the state"" and just needed to get some info from me so that they could get me a lower rate. I knew it was fishy but I was very overwhelmed and did end up signing the contract, but was able to cancel it ASAP once I confirmed it was a scam, so luckily I was never charged anything. 

Anyway, I'm wondering if there's any specific department in my city or state's government that it would make sense to write to about this specific issue. I realize there might not actually be anything they can do about it, but basically I just want to be able to send a letter explaining what happened and requesting a call for action to prevent vulnerable people (i.e. elderly individuals living in my apartment building) from getting taken advantage of by companies like this.

I recently had to move out of the apt I've been renting for about a year and a half because my previous landlord was selling the house. In my search for a new place, I reconnected with a friend of my father's who said he had a place. He wanted to sublease his basement to me (private bathroom & kitchen included) and being that it's actually huge and gorgeous, just about the same size as my previous apt for cheaper, AND has high ceilings I jumped on the chance, even turning down other offers. He got permission from HIS landlord to sublease to me. We both signed a handwritten contract until we get a more official version of said contract. So everything's running smoothly, until the day I'm moving all my stuff in through my entrance. His wife storms down the stairs and is enrageddddd I'm moving in. She's basically trying to stop me. I've never met this woman in my life, and had assumed she was OK with me moving in since I had signed a contract and had an agreement with her husband for a whole year, to whom I also already paid my first month & security to. She is also on his lease, while I'm only subleasing. Is she entitled to kick me out, or is his permission, the landlord's permission, and or verbal & handwritten (soon to be official) agreement enough to get her to back tf up? 

Sidenote- I assume she thinks I'm doing stuff with her husband or something, but I'm a lesbian and only think of him as a connection to my father, who passed last year. She doesn't work, and apparently spent over $120, 000 of her husband's money this year, which is the reason he had to rent the space. They're broke, basically, without my help & his brother who lives upstairs, they would also be evicted due to lack of funds. I really don't want to get involved in their relationship, but since it affects my living situation.. I just want to know if I'm protected or what I should do to be protected.

Backstory: nothing regarding appliances or repairs is mentioned in our lease. we’re renting a house from my best friends brother- doing us both a favor. He’s getting monthly rent out of a house that was not habitable, I have cheaper rent on some property with the possibility of buying. He’s 100% stuck on “I’m doing you a favor,” even though we’ve put over $1000 worth of work into this money pit and he hasn’t done a single thing he’s promised. We moved in on the agreement that we would renovate the house, no credit check or deposit to move in. This house was a wreck. Sunlight showed through the floors where they didn’t seal or insulate, gaping holes in the floors and ceilings, nothing was caulked, he put a jack under the house to “level” it, cracking all the flooring in the bathroom and making it extremely unlevel. This also caused beams in the master bedroom to fall, there’s no flooring in the kitchen or dining room, these are some of the more major issues we’ve already repaired or are working on. I could go on for days. We saw the opportunity to play fixer upper, and didn’t mind the work. Our first power bill was $600. Four months later, our power bill is $260. We’ve made this place look like a totally different house. 

When we moved in, we paid to have the central air repaired. They never used filters or cleaned after themselves and it sucked all sorts of things into the unit. It cost us $400 to repair. He came in and offered to replace the broken fridge in the house- freezer didn’t freeze and fridge was on its last leg. That was in July. In august we pushed the issue, so he bought us a fridge, so we thought. Turns out his wife got it from a co-worker, and it was also broken. Didn’t work at all, So we had him take it back. They then just ignored the situation, but had some issues arise at home so we figured we’d step back and give them some time to figure it out. We bought a chest freezer to suffice, and don’t spend much on fridge foods to prevent spoilage and losing money. Last week our fridge started dying, for real this time. The lowest the temp would go was 56 degrees, spoiling any dairy that was inside. Water bottles weren’t cold and everything felt room temp. We let them know that we were needing a fridge ASAP, I’m 9 months pregnant and this isn’t something I want to worry with anymore. We asked if we could take November’s rent and buy a fridge, They replied today that this isn’t their responsibility, they’re doing us a favor by providing appliances in the first place, and they would give us their current fridge and go buy themselves a new one in two weeks. Not something we can wait for considering we’ve already lost an entire fridge worth of food. We’ve also been begging for other vital repairs, there is siding on the back exterior wall where insulation is exposed and rotting away. Rain water pours into this opening. We were told he’d fix this in July. There’s rotting wood in the back yard, amongst a pile of his belongings including a truck bed liner, old tires, and a commercial refrigerator door covered in carpenter ants and wasp nests. I have a toddler, dog, and husband who love to be outside but this pile of junk is causing more trouble than just being an eyesore. He’s said multiple times that he will get it. We’re tired of getting the run around, and want to know what we can do. They live four houses down from us, he’s a contractor, and has daily access to the necessary tools and supplies to make this happen. Basically, we’re expected to pay rent to them monthly and they don’t have to do anything as landlords. We don’t want to cause turmoil, but they are very ignorant and self righteous.

When I was 17, I was raped. It was awful and traumatic and resulted in me making some pretty shitty choices. However, this is about the way it was handled. 

It happened at a party and immediately after I found my 2 friends and told them what happened. They were very smart and made the right call and drove me to the emergency room at the closest hospital (PA if it matters). I made it very clear to everyone I spoke to that I did not want my parents to know (wasn’t supposed to be at the party and thought they would be mad at me) and did not provide any contact information for them. I went through what I assume is the normal protocol following a rape, everything is moving along in an albeit disorganized manner, until finally a doctor comes in and tells me that unless I alert my parents and get their consent, he won’t administer a rape kit because I am a minor. At this point I just wanted everything to be over so I reiterated that I did not want to tell my parents and as a result, was discharged. 

My parents eventually found out and sent me to therapy (they were not mad, just worried about me) and when discussing it with my therapist she informed me that my age in that case shouldn’t have mattered because even though I was a minor, I was above the age needed for parental consent  for a rape kit and that age is way lower than 18, largely in order to protect kids whose parents or guardians are the abusers. 

I want to know that if by not giving me a kit, the hospital was in some way negligent (or something else idk) and whether I could take them to court as a result. I hate to think that my rapist is out there doing what he did to me to other girls, but because of my lack of kit I know there’s no evidence and, frankly, no reason for a jury to believe me over him. The only way I feel I can finally get closure from this awful incident is by holding someone accountable, and I am curious as to whether I would have a legal leg to stand on against the hospital. Thank you all for taking the time to read this and offer advice.

I was unaware of this post until I made a Nextdoor account recently. While using the app, I found the post and contacted the person who found my tortoise. They sent me a quick reply about how his children have adopted the tortoise and how it is in their care now. He is unwilling to give it back. I have pictures saved of this tortoise and I would be able to identify it. 

Are there any laws surrounding this? How can I get my tortoise back into my care? 

Thank you for any advice, I appreciate it",3
"If I suspect my neighbor may be mistreating and potentially abusing her children, at what point do I involve the police?",2,dpfvuk,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dpfvuk/if_i_suspect_my_neighbor_may_be_mistreating_and/,15,1572511479.0,"
I (34F) live in an 8 until apartment building. I have a 2 story corner unit that shares a wall with another 2 story unit. Earlier this summer, a woman moved in with her two children, a son (9M) and daughter I think is 6-8ish. (I only know the sons age because I heard the mother scream it at him.) The kids appeared to have spent the summer with their grandmother, rarely home if ever, but as soon as school started they were here full time. 

Every single day since, and I mean every single day, without fail, the mother screams at those kids, from the moment they get home until they go to bed which is typically 4-5pm to 8-9pm. She also screams at them almost every morning when trying to get them off to school. She screams so loud it sounds like she is in my apartment. I can literally make out every word she is saying clear as day like she is in the room with me, not the typically through the wall muffle. For reference, the previous tenant was a young couple with a 4 year old son and I heard them maybe 3 times over the course of 2 years. 

Anyway, the screams often sounded like normal frustrated mother stuff. It never appeared like the kids did anything wrong, it just sounded like she had no patience for them. It made me sad and also incredible frustrated. I found myself avoiding going home before 10pm. About a week or two ago I was awoken at 2am by her screaming. I told my sister about it and she told me she used to see my neighbor all the time in the school drop off line smoking with the windows up, kids in the car. (Which is illegal in my state.) But she hasn’t seen her lately. She asked my nephew if he knew the little girl and he said “oh yeah, that’s the girl that never smiles.” It broke my heart. 

The past two weeks I have been mostly working from home and it’s really been getting to me. Then tonight happened and I’m at my wits end.... The normal screaming, banging and loud noises had been going on for over an hour or two. Then the son let out a bloodcurdling scream that lasted a solid 5 minutes straight without taking a breath. After which I heard him screaming and crying saying “mummy, that hurt” over and over.  She started screaming back “You’re out of fucking control. You’re an animal. You’re out of fucking control. You’re an animal” over and over with a “I didn’t touch you” thrown in there once for good measure. (Many f-bombs were dropped on the kid tonight.) She finally yells for him to go upstairs. He’s crying in protest. They have a long argument with him saying he’s scared and her saying “You’re 10. You’re 9 almost 10. You’re not.” They go back and forth for a while. I stopped listening and then I hear him yell “please don’t hurt me!” I started listening again after that, but was kind of lost in the conversation. He was accusing her of something, calling out her bad behavior, and goes on to say he got a note at school saying he had 27 tardies and was talking about how it’s her fault and she needs to change. (Which explains why my sister hasn’t been seeing them in the school drop off line.) The mother brushed off the fact that it’s always her fault he’s late for school, accused him of being a liar about the 27 tardies, saying it wasn’t that many, and sent him to his room. 

I don’t know my neighbor or her situation. I don’t know if she’s going through a rough patch in her life, she is someone that just shouldn’t have children, or if she is actually abusive. Well I know she is mentally and emotionally abusive, after tonight I suspect she MAY be physically abusive as well. At what point do I involve the police? I feel like after tonight I should say SOMETHING. Perhaps ask for a welfare check? I know yelling at your kids isn’t illegal, but every single day for hours is definitely some type of mental abuse. What do I do?



TLDR: My neighbor screams at her children every single day for hours and tonight I heard her 9 year old son beg her not to hurt him. Don’t know if I should involve the police or not. If I do involve police, how do I go about it?

Edit: Location Massachusetts, US.

Update: I reached out to the school resource officer (basically a Liason police officer that monitors the schools daily), told him my story, gave him as much information as I could, and asked him to talk to the kids’ teachers and principals to see if they had similar concerns. The tenant on the other side of my neighbor is a retired police officer and appears to have made a few phones calls himself. I couldn’t see them as I didn’t want to walk out into the hallway and give myself away, but some people knocked on my neighbors door today while the kids were at school. They talked to her about the “disturbance” last night for a good hour. She lied through her teeth, acted so nice, sweet, upbeat, and fake. I don’t know if anything will come from that interview today, but I think it had an impact because she and the kids got home from trick or treating about 40 mins ago and I haven’t heard her raise her voice once.",2

Kidnapping grandparents call CPS on us after the police ordered the return of the child to parents.,3,dpdwe1,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dpdwe1/kidnapping_grandparents_call_cps_on_us_after_the/,1,1572502710.0,"Okay so, this is going to be alot of information, and I'm going to do my best to make sure I include everything, I'm also new to reddit so I'm unsure if this is the right flare. I'm staring at the beginning, The child is developmentally delayed by a year. TLDR at the bottom. I'm sorry this exceeds the two paragraph rule, but I can not condense this down further without leaving out important information. 

KN= kidnapper bio grandfather, heart condition. 

SKN= kidnapper step grandmother (married after child was born) missing a leg due and got a huge settlement from it. Main antagonist. 

Mom= my mom, has minor learning disability and speech impediment, disabled due to a shattered shoulder, knee replacement and plates in the other shoulder. 

BIOF= biological father, my brother who is mentally challenged. Not disabled 

BIOM= biological mother, brothers wife, who is mentally challenged. Not disabled.

Me= child's legal aunt, Physically disabled, I can function but need many many sit breaks due to the pain I am in constantly, but at home I can use my wheelchair if needed with free access. 

KN and SKN had nothing to do with kid until guardianship papers, saw him maybe 10 times in 2 years despite living in the same town, less than 15 minutes away. Kid, BIOM, and BIOF have lived with mom and I for the majority of the childs life, aproxmently 1.6 years of his 2 years of existence. BIOM/BIOF do not currently live with us anymore

I have an audio recording of a meeting between mom, me, SKN, and KN discussing what we wanted on the paperwork eveyones voice is clear. SKN crafted the papers, not a lawyer. 

The ""daycare"" KN and SKN sent him to (and put in the false papers he couldn't be taken out of the ""daycare"", even when with mom) is family run by the SKN's daughter n law and the toddler napped on a couch or the floor, not a cot or bed as required in day care. I kinda think this is whos care he was under when the bruises actually occurred, but of course there is the possibility it was SKN or KN or anyone else they had in their home. 

KN, SKN, and us met to notarize ""guardianship"" papers after BIOM and BIOF got in an augment that escalated, both are in therapy and marriage counseling now and were back together at the time of this. KN and SKN refused to allow me on the papers and only Mom was allowed, so 2vs 1. Two week rotation, they treated it and told us as if that the papers meant BIOM and BIOF had signed over their rights, and would only let BIOM and BIOF vist 2 times a week, if they felt like it. 

CPS call SKN's daughter n law did on us right before refusing to return him, proved us to be safe and competent.

We did talk to a lawer about if the paperwork even meant anything after they stated in TEXT they would not return him and Multiple admissions to crimes, including blackmailing BIOF, and the statement ""we have unlimited funds for lawyer"" all in one single text, the lawer only looked at the guardianship paper and told us BIOM and BIOF still had 100% rights and send us away, no charge, so the blackmail is just what I could easily see as Very illegal. ""Per not sighing the paperwork (a full custody transfer) we will fight to take rights away from BIOF"" roughly. The lawyer said if charges are filed he will take mom's case further. 

Only the BIO parents have custody rights as they papers were never turned into the court or approved by a judge, the child was in mom and I's care after police intervention, they still have 100% of their parental rights.

Less than 5 hours later suddenly SKN have pictures from over three weeks ago ""proving"" we beat him, and somehow this ended up in the presence of a ""non related mandatory reporter"" and resulted in CPS and cop at our house late into the night. Bio parents do not live with us, and were at work at the time. Child was staying with us until they voluntary of their own will decided to take parenting classes, and asked us to keep the kid until they complete them, becuse they knew if they took him home CPS would be called on them, as SKN yelled this as we picked up the child. The photos look VERY bad and CPS allowed him to stay with us overnight and told us to not let the child out of our care, an offical investigation has to be done, of which we are complying with 100%, however they did place him on state care the next day because no one will admit to hurting the child. I want to know who did this to him and when. The photos CPS had looked EXTREMELY fresh, like it had just happened, The scratch Marks were still red, and red around the bruises. CPS did not give us a copy of these photos, however are looking into when they were taken instead of when it was sent to SKN. The Child was in SKN and KN care when the photos were taken, after they had had him all night. 

We never saw any evidence of this when in mom and i's care, and I kinda think/hope its photoshop, he is developmentally delayed by a year, under no circumstances should anyone be rough handling him, and quite frankly it makes me want to vomit that anyone would do that to him.

SKN is friends with a local judge, I do know which one. She also has a justice degree and I'm not really sure what that entails, but she acts like it's a Big deal.

possible subpoena's for medical professionals, they all are very aware and to quote ""he needs to be with you"" said to mom by two different ones.

It's a bull**** claim, and I'm sure some photo analysis will show when this happened he was not in our care.

What do I do besides get a lawyer? They accused me, my mother, we are both disabled and I dont even have an income becuse I'm still waiting to be approved. Is there a program to help find a lawyer? I have never been in legal trouble in my whole life, not even wrote up in school. Should I get my own or go in with my mom? Right now they said they suspect us all of neglect becuse no one reported it, if I had ever seen bruising that bad I'd have called the cops immediately, as it was very obviously not just normal kids play bruising.

I would never hurt our little sunshine, not when i promised him the first time I watched him that I would always do everything in my power to make sure he is safe and happy, and protect him to the end of my life. He is just a baby, why would anyone hurt him? 

TLDR: SKN and KN claimed to have filed illegal paperwork that took custody away from BIO parents, then refused to return the child, police got involved, kid was returned, then suddenly CPS gets a report and photos from SKN claiming that child is being beaten and now the state has temporary custody, As evey party involved is a suspect.

I am renting a house in Oregon. There is an overhead light fixture in the dining room that doesn’t work. It seems to be a wiring problem but the property management won’t get it fixed. They keep slow-playing it by telling me that they have been really busy or they have to ask the owner of the home, etc. And then there will be no word from them for days. Finally I gave them the possibility of me getting it fixed and then deducting the cost from the rent (which I believe is okay up to $300 in this state). At that point they just say, “the owner wants to handle it himself”. Then nothing ever happens. 

What the heck can I do about this? It seems that I don’t really have any leverage. I suppose that I could give them an ultimatum that I will start reducing my rent payments until the situation is resolved but I wonder if I can actually legally do this.

My wife's mother (My mother-in-law) has a history of attacking, belittling and blackmailing my wife. Recently she has taken my wife's daughter (I am not the biological father) to live with her, while my wife tries to move back to Washington. My wife does not want to move to Washington but she is essentially being blackmailed to move back with the threat of having CPS called on her. The reason this is relevant is that she has had a few cases with CPS with our children. I am asking for how bleak are her chances if she tries to get her back, or is there a way we can get our daughter back as soon as possible without too much court involvement. She has been told on several occasions how if she doesn't comply with her mother's wishes that she will call CPS. Any advice would be appreciated on what we can do. 

&#x200B;

Some things we have considered right now:

1. Setting myself up with parental rights for our daughter, since birth I have been who she considers a father and have also been the one taking care of her (I have signed my rights away at birth since I am not the biological father). The biological father is nowhere to be found and I would have to do some sleuthing to figure that out. 
2. We have also considered filing for a kidnapping (Not sure if that is the legal term) since my wife was also promised that our daughter would be returned, and has had little contact with her since she has left months ago). 
3. Also Considering going towards a custody hearing and work through the Washington courts to get our daughter back. 

&#x200B;

Some Notes about my wife: My wife has been suffering from mental issues and is just recently and she has been getting help. The stress and pressure between CPS, and her mother have not been helping. Add on top of that animosity towards me from her side of the family( I am unsure why) and that should be all the pertinent information of the situation.   


Disclaimer: I am aware that I should seek legal advice from a professional. I am currently overseas due to work and my wife has hit a point where she is struggling to get through the day so it's on me to do most of the heavy lifting.

Which brings us to now, the lawyer had placed a lien on my car since her name is also on the title because she co-signed my car[?] 

So my question to you all now is, can the court come after my vehicle despite the lean only being on her name? And it might be worth noting that on paper, she does not own any other vehicle aside for the one that she is currently co-signing with me.  

Also, the vehicle value is definitely beyond that of $1,000 so I believe it cannot be exempted.",3
