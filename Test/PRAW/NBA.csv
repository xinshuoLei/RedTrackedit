Wilt Chamberlain secretly dominated professional basketball at age 16 under a false identity. Scoring as much as 46 points against pros in the Eastern U.S. with a team record of 36-1. By age 17 he was averaging 40.5ppg. This is the first time I'm sharing this research:,30997,6cbgx1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/6cbgx1/wilt_chamberlain_secretly_dominated_professional/,1496,1495329131.0,"[Wilt Chamberlain Dominating Professional basketball leagues at age 16, and 17](http://imgur.com/vNZZsm5)

Calculated averages for 17 year old Wilt as a Quakertown Fay:

* 40.5ppg in 9 regular season games (according to one of the articles)

* 74ppg in 6 playoff games (according to the math... not sure it's even possible but who knows)

* 53.9ppg in 15 total games (according to a Quakertown book)

* Worth mentioning he won the MVP award in that league

[Image 5](http://i.imgur.com/ecuUBnC.png)

Wilt Chamberlain, or as he was first known, ""George Marcus"", secretly dominated professional basketball under that assumed identity at age 16 for the Pittsburgh Raiders. Even as a kid against 6-11 men his own size playing professionally (such as former Harlem Globetrotters!) he averaged 53.9ppg by age 17. I found game recaps of multiple 46 point performances for the Quakertown Fay's at age 17, and at least one 44 point game even at age 16 for the Pittsburgh Raiders.

This is not only not often talked about, it's NEVER talked about. I've seen only a few references to his professional career that predated college basketball. When I researched this I found out it got him into potential trouble with the NCAA and so it was kept hushed and perhaps left to be forgotten.

*EDIT* Allow me to plug one other researcher who I've come to learn first shared the photographs of Wilt playing for the Fay's a few years ago. I found him on Twitter, and here's a link to a fascinating video he produced!

https://twitter.com/storyrd

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un5HPRWW4Yk

*EDIT*

IMPORTANT UPDATE - According to a Quakertown book (researched by [bardown](http://www.bardown.com/under-a-fake-identity-wilt-chamberlain-dominated-pro-basketball-when-he-was-16-and-17-1.757398) staff) Wilt actually averaged 53.9ppg in all 15 games as a Quakertown Fay! He ""only"" averaged 40.5ppg in 9 regular season games but with playoffs combined his 15 game average shoots up to 53.9ppg! This means 74ppg in the 6 playoff games as a Fay. I'm not sure if this is even possible so please take with a grain of salt. Though he did score 90 points in high school and 100 in the NBA including 5 other 70+ point games so who knows. This being against former pros his own size too including 6-11 former Globetrotter Andy Maddox!",30997

ESPN/ABC should take note of what Tony Romo did in the booth last night and replace Mark Jackson with someone who actually provides insight and perspective during a nationally televised NBA game.,30031,aie075,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/aie075/espnabc_should_take_note_of_what_tony_romo_did_in/,1971,1548129341.0,"Last night Tony Romo added beautiful color commentary to the Chiefs/Patriots game last night. As a former Quarterback he provided great insight as to what play the other team may or may not run, and why. He even predicted quite a few plays. 

What we get for nationally televised NBA games during the Conference Finals and NBA finals from Mark Jackson is nothing short of crap. Jackson offers no insight as a former point guard. Instead he spends most of the game poking fun at JVG and talking about absolute nonsense and quite frankly I’m sick of it. He distracts the fans and ruins the experience, especially when it’s a game when there’s so much on the line. ",30031

Bad officiating calls in Warriors-Rockets G7,26694,8mzetu,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8mzetu/bad_officiating_calls_in_warriorsrockets_g7/,3135,1527632056.0,"Strap in boys, it's gonna be a ride. So I've basically reviewed the whole game last night, and here are the questionable plays which I thought should have been calls/were called wrongly.

#Calls going against Rockets:

1. [Wrong travelling call against Capela](https://streamable.com/cso98), didn't lift up his pivot foot.

2. [Slight push on PJ Tucker no call, KD gets the call on the other end](https://streamable.com/boqtv). Probably a superstar call.

3. [Harden might have gotten shoved in the back by Looney](https://streamable.com/7189z), no call.

4. [Capela called for a goaltend for what seemed to be a clean block](https://streamable.com/qtz8u).

5. [Harden fouled on the landing](https://streamable.com/4d9r6), no call. [Slowmo](https://streamable.com/s06jh)

6. [Harden fouled on three attempt](https://streamable.com/bzjys), no call. [Slowmo](https://streamable.com/alpcm)

7. [Ref disallows continuation on Harden's three](https://streamable.com/vhads). [Slowmo](https://streamable.com/lydp2)

8. [Eric Gordon fouled by Draymond](https://streamable.com/zynw6), no call.

#Calls going against Warriors:

1. [Klay gets called for an early 2nd foul which didn't look like much contact](https://streamable.com/e0s94), looked like ball just slipped out of EG's hands.

2. [Curry's hip gets pushed by Gerald Green](https://streamable.com/o4nk6), even falls on the ground. No call.

3. [Jordan Bell raked across the arm by Harden](https://streamable.com/s2n6m), no call. (pro tip: right click and select 1/4 speed to see the contact)

4. [Klay gets hand checked by Tucker and loses the ball](https://streamable.com/pqylu). No call. [Slowmo](https://streamable.com/j8f9c)

5. [KD gets pushed into Harden by Ryan Anderson](https://streamable.com/n27zm), foul on KD. Similar to [this play](https://streamable.com/nhcep), albeit less egregious by Anderson.

6. [Klay gets a point removed by Scott Foster](https://streamable.com/0nhtk).

A major theme which showed itself was the fact that Ryan Anderson literally (I'm not kidding) hand checked Curry every time he was switched onto him. And the Warriors forced that switch A LOT. Here's ALL the plays where Anderson guarded Curry:

Oh and, inb4 Rockets fans accuse me of bias again, and calling me a Warriors fan. Would a Warrior fan post these?

The entire game is freely available online, if you're so angry why don't you make your own compilation? And u/unklebuckets, still waiting for [your refs lowlights thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8mf8tv/post_game_thread_the_golden_state_warriors_33/dzn4mpy/?context=3), or any of the 1+ million subscribers to make one.
