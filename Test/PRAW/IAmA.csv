#[I’m Paula Jean Swearengin, and I’m running for US Senate in West Virginia.](http://imgur.com/U9Jtsbx)

---

Barely five months ago, I was standing at a town hall where Joe Manchin was supposed to be listening to his constituents in Charleston, West Virginia. I’ve been a social and economic activist for many years, and I heard that he was at this town hall, just minutes after I got off work. I left in such a hurry that I didn’t even have money for the toll -- I had to leave an IOU instead. I was desperate to speak to him because my community had suffered so much, and I held onto the hope that he would hear me. Instead of cooking dinner for my youngest son, yet again, I went on a mission to beg for my children’s future. I wanted them to have clean water, clean air, and a stable economic future. I was especially frustrated because the most-polluting coal baron in West Virginia, Jim Justice, became my Democratic Governor. His mountaintop removal coal-mining operation is just three miles from my house, and continues to put silica dust in the air and my childrens’ lungs daily.

---

###When I approach my Senator, I told him about the water pollution, air pollution, and the fact that I buried most of my family because of coal mining with diseases like black lung and cancer. I told him that we all deserved clean and safe jobs. 

---

“We would have to agree to disagree” he told me, as he tried to bid the coal miners in the crowd against me. When I told him about my family dying, he turned to them and said they needed jobs -- as if that was more important than their own safety, and their families and surrounding communities being poisoned and dying.

Not only did he act like he was immune to my struggle as a coal miner’s daughter, he tried to divide and turn our community against one another. We shouldn’t have to fight each other for basic human rights like clean water, clean air and have access to jobs to provide for our families.Little did Joe know that the coal miners in the crowd met and stood with me afterwards, and we talked about real solutions -- not just slogans.

A month earlier, Sen. Manchin taunted voters to kick him out of office if they didn’t like what he was up to. “What you ought to do is vote me out. Vote me out! I’m not changing. Find somebody else who can beat me and vote me out,” he said. So, after my encounter with the Senator, I decided to take him up on his challenge -- I was going to take his seat from him, and return representation to the people of West Virginia.

Like most of my generation I was born a coal miner’s daughter and granddaughter. I have lived most of my life watching the progression and regression of coal. I have witnessed
first-hand the impact it has on our health and communities. I have in lived poverty and in prosperity. I have tasted polluted water. I have enjoyed some of the cleanest water in the world -- that no longer exists. I have dealt with the suffering of burying family members far too soon and too young. I have lived in cancer-clustered communities. I live with the worry that my children will get cancer. I have watched my neighbors suffer on their way to the same fate. I can’t help but feel overwhelmed with the frustration of what will happen to the people of Appalachia.

The promise of coal means more pollution, more cancer, and more black lung. The companies are still blowing up our mountains, burying our streams, destroying our heritage and devaluing our quality of life. We have no promise of a stable economic future with the market for coal being down. It has always been an unreliable and unstable economic resource. As many communities are forced to live in conditions comparable to a third-world country, people fear how they are going to provide for their families. No man or woman should have to choose between poisoning one child and feeding another.

It’s past time to end the fear that divides us. We need to start standing up for each other. There are alternatives. We can invest in a diverse economy. I, for one, don’t want my children to
inherit the struggles that we have had to endure. 

I’m proud to be a [Justice Democrat](http://www.justicedemocrats.com?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=PaulaJean&utm_campaign=AMA0801) and a [Brand New Congress](http://www.brandnewcongress.org?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=PaulaJean&utm_campaign=AMA0801) candidate. That means I take $0 in corporate donations or PAC money. Zero. I rely on 100% individual small donors. I’ve watched how corporate money can twist even good politicians. I watched it happen to Sen. Manchin. I voted for him, long ago -- but I no longer recognize that man I voted for. It also means I support the [Brand New Congress platform](https://brandnewcongress.org/platform?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=PaulaJean&utm_campaign=AMA0801), including Medicare for All, free public higher and vocational education, and moving to an expanded economy for West Virginia and America, based on renewable energy.

Gordon Ramsay here. This is my first time doing a reddit AMA, and I'm looking forward to answering as many of your questions as time permits this morning (with assistance from Victoria from reddit).

This week we are celebrating a milestone, I'm taping my 500th episode (#ramsay500) for FOX prime time!

About me: I'm an award-winning chef and restaurateur with 25 restaurants worldwide (http://www.gordonramsay.com/). Also known for presenting television programs, including Hell's Kitchen, MasterChef, MasterChef Junior, Hotel Hell and Kitchen Nightmares.

AMA!

**Update** First of all, I'd like to say thank you.

And never trust a fat chef, because they've eaten all the good bits. 

And I've really enjoyed myself, it's been a fucking blast. And I *promise* you, I won't wait as long to do this again next time. Because it's fucking great! ",2015-04-20 08:05:19
"We are firefighters and net neutrality experts. Verizon was caught throttling the Santa Clara Fire Department's unlimited Internet connection during one of California’s biggest wildfires. We're here to answer your questions about it, or net neutrality in general, so ask us anything!",72333,99z6z7,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/99z6z7/we_are_firefighters_and_net_neutrality_experts/,3388,1535159093.0,"Hey Reddit,

This summer, firefighters in California have been risking their lives battling the worst wildfire in the state’s history. And in the midst of this emergency, Verizon was [just caught](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/08/verizon-throttled-fire-departments-unlimited-data-during-calif-wildfire/) throttling their Internet connections, endangering public safety just to make a few extra bucks.

This is incredibly dangerous, and shows why big Internet service providers can’t be trusted to control what we see and do online. This is exactly the kind of abuse we warned about when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted to end net neutrality.

To push back, we’ve organized an open letter from first responders asking Congress to restore federal net neutrality rules and other key protections that were lost when the FCC voted to repeal the 2015 *Open Internet Order.* **[If you’re a first responder, please add your name here.](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/first-responders-demand-real-net-neutrality-protections/)** 

In California, the state legislature is considering a state-level net neutrality bill known as Senate Bill 822 (SB822) that would restore strong protections. Ask your [assemblymembers to support SB822 using the tools here](https://www.battleforthenet.com/california/). California lawmakers are also holding a hearing [TODAY](https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/08/23/california-state-assembly-plans-hearing-on-verizon-throttling-of-firefighters-data/) on Verizon’s throttling in the Select Committee on Natural Disaster Response, Recovery and Rebuilding.

We are firefighters, net neutrality experts and digital rights advocates here to answer your questions about net neutrality, so ask us anything! We'll be answering your questions from 10:30am PT till about 1:30pm PT.

Who we are:

* Adam Cosner (California Professional Firefighters) - /u/AdamCosner
* Laila Abdelaziz (Campaigner at Fight for the Future) - /u/labdel
* Ernesto Falcon (Legislative Counsel at Electronic Frontier Foundation) - /u/EFFfalcon
* Harold Feld (Senior VP at Public Knowledge) - /u/HaroldFeld
* Mark Stanley (Director of Communications and Operations at Demand Progress) - /u/MarkStanley
* Josh Tabish (Tech Exchange Fellow at Fight for the Future) - /u/jdtabish

---

No matter where you live, head over to [BattleForTheNet.com](https://www.battleforthenet.com/) or call (202) 759-7766 to take action and tell your Representatives in Congress to support the net neutrality Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution, which if passed would overturn the repeal. The CRA resolution has already passed in the Senate. Now, we need 218 representatives to sign the discharge petition (177 have already [signed](http://clerk.house.gov/115/lrc/pd/petitions/DisPet0011.xml) it) to force a vote on the measure in the House where congressional leadership is blocking it from advancing.

[Proof.](https://twitter.com/fightfortheftr/status/1033009545088389121)

UPDATE: So, why should this be considered a net neutrality issue? TL;DR: The repealed 2015 Open Internet Order could have prevented fiascos like what happened with Verizon's throttling of the Santa Clara County fire department.

I'm an ex-Scientologist who was trafficked for labor by Scientology from ages 15 - 18. I reported it to the FBI and they did nothing. AMA [Trigger Warning],68409,atkycd,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/atkycd/im_an_exscientologist_who_was_trafficked_for/,2994,1550888580.0,"My name is [Derek Bloch](https://www.youtube.com/user/dbloch7986). 

I am not the typical ""high-ranking"" or celebrity Scientologist. I am more familiar with the low-level, day-to-day activities of cult members than anything else. I was exposed to some of the worst kinds of abuse, but compared to some of the other stories I have heard I got away relatively unscathed (and I am thankful for that). [Now I live on my own as a lower-middle-class, married, gay man.](https://truepic.com/gx54exce) 

FTR: I have been going to therapy for years. That's helped me gain some insight into myself and the damage that Scientology and my parents did me when I was younger. That's not to say I'm not an emotional and psychological wreck, because I kinda still am sometimes! I'm not a licensed psychologist but I think therapy has given me the tools to objectively understand my experience and writing about it is cathartic. Hence, the AMA.

[First I shared an anonymous account of my story online to a board specifically for ex-Scientologists.](http://www.forum.exscn.net/threads/a-brief-summary-of-my-time-inside.26189/#post656666) It's important to note there are two distinct religious separations in my life: (1) is when I was kicked out of the Sea Org at age 18 (literally 2 days after my birthday) because I developed a relationship with someone who also had a penis; and (2) is when I left Scientology at age 26 altogether after sharing my story publicly.

After Scientology's PR Police hunted me down using that post, my parents threw me out. On my way out, my dad called me a >!""pussy""!< for sharing my story anonymously. He also said he didn't raise his son to be a >!""faggot""!<. >!{Side note that this is the same guy who told me to kill myself because I am gay during separation #1 above.}!<

[Being the petty person that I am, I of course spoke to a journalist and went very public about all of it immediately after.](https://www.villagevoice.com/2012/05/16/scientology-disconnection-and-homophobia-derek-blochs-story/)

>!(Ef yoo dad.)!<

[I also wrote a Cracked listicle (full disclosure they paid me $100 for that).](http://www.cracked.com/personal-experiences-1328-5-disturbing-things-i-learned-in-scientologys-space-navy.html)

I tried to do an Aftermath-style show but apparently there were some issues with the fact that they paid me $500 to appear on the show (that was about $5-$7/hr worth of compensation). So it was shelved. Had I known that would be a determining factor it would have been easy to refuse the money. Production staff said it was normal and necessary. [Here is the story about that experience (and it was awful and I am still pissed that it didn't air, but w/e.)](https://tonyortega.org/2017/07/27/derek-bloch-on-fighting-scientology-disconnection-in-an-unaired-tv-series-2/)

Obviously, I don't have any documentation about my conversations with the FBI, but that happened too. You'll just have to take my word for it.

*On that note, I am 95% sure this post will get buried by Scientology, overlooked by the sub because of timing, or buried by higher-quality content. I might even get sued, who knows. I don't really care anymore!* 

*I'll be popping in when I get some notifications, but otherwise I'm just assuming this will disappear into the* [abyss of the interweb tubes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cZC67wXUTs)*.*

Some people have always wanted to go into politics. _Not me._ I’d rather be hiking with my dog, to be perfectly frank. Or gardening… or making jam.

“Don’t MAKE me come down there!” That’s what it feels like—like we have to deal with misbehaving kids in the backseat of a car. “I WILL turn this state around!”

Someone has to, right?

#Evidently we can’t leave governance to those who want to do it as a career. Sometimes regular people have to step in and demand we work on issues that will help people rather than engage in party politics. We need more public servants, and fewer politicians.

We are the ACLU. Ask Us Anything about net neutrality!,65088,6mvhn3,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/6mvhn3/we_are_the_aclu_ask_us_anything_about_net/,5407,1499909416.0,"TAKE ACTION HERE: https://www.aclu.org/net-neutralityAMA

Today a diverse coalition of interested parties including the ACLU, Amazon, Etsy, Mozilla, Kickstarter, and many others came together to sound the alarm about the Federal Communications Commission’s attack on net neutrality.
A free and open internet is vital for our democracy and for our daily lives. But the FCC is considering a proposal that threatens net neutrality — and therefore the internet as we know it.

“Network neutrality” is based on a simple premise: that the company that provides your Internet connection can't interfere with how you communicate over that connection. An Internet carrier’s job is to deliver data from its origin to its destination — not to block, slow down, or de-prioritize information because they don't like its content.

Today you’ll chat with:

 - u/JayACLU - Jay Stanley, senior policy analyst with the ACLU Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project
 - u/LeeRowlandACLU – Lee Rowland, senior staff attorney with the ACLU’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project

We have to keep the pressure on.

Update 2: That's a wrap! Thanks for your questions and for your help in the fight to rein in government spying powers.
------------

A mass surveillance law is set to expire on December 31, and we need to make sure Congress seizes the opportunity to reform it.  Sadly, however, some members of Congress actually want to expand the authority. We need to make sure their proposals do not become law. 
 
Under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the National Security Agency operates at least two spying programs, PRISM and Upstream, which threaten our privacy and violate our Fourth Amendment rights.

The surveillance permitted under Section 702 sweeps up emails, instant messages, video chats, and phone calls, and stores them in databases that we estimate include over one billion communications. While Section 702 ostensibly allows the government to target foreigners for surveillance, based on some estimates, roughly half of these files contain information about a U.S. citizen or resident, which the government can sift through without a warrant for purposes that have nothing to do with protecting our country from foreign threats.
 
Some in Congress would rather extend the law as is, or make it even worse. We need to make clear to our lawmakers that we’re expecting them to rein government’s worst and most harmful spying powers.

Three of these planets are firmly located in the habitable zone, the area around the parent star where a rocky planet is most likely to have liquid water.

NASA TRAPPIST-1 News Briefing (recording) http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/100200725
For more info about the discovery, visit https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/trappist1/

This discovery sets a new record for greatest number of habitable-zone planets found around a single star outside our solar system. All of these seven planets could have liquid water – key to life as we know it – under the right atmospheric conditions, but the chances are highest with the three in the habitable zone.

At about 40 light-years (235 trillion miles) from Earth, the system of planets is relatively close to us, in the constellation Aquarius. Because they are located outside of our solar system, these planets are scientifically known as exoplanets.

We're a group of experts here to answer your questions about the discovery, NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, and our search for life beyond Earth. Please post your questions here. We'll be online from 3-5 p.m. EST (noon-2 p.m. PST, 20:00-22:00 UTC), and will sign our answers. Ask us anything!

"I am a 17 year old protest medic for the on-going Hong Kong protests, I helped treat a lot of injured protesters while they were protesting. AMA.",60793,dfesr9,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/dfesr9/i_am_a_17_year_old_protest_medic_for_the_ongoing/,2581,1570643490.0,"Hello there Reddit, I opened this account just to start this AMA for personal security reasons. With how the situation is progressing, I think that not even the volunteer medics will be spared.

I saw that other post where a protester set up an AMA and thought that maybe I could chime in as well.

I've been at the protests during weekends and holidays since I'm also currently in secondary school. I've witnessed first hand the injuries sustained by the protesters due to their participation in the movement and have been in a few situations where I almost got arrested.

You can ask me stuff about the injuries I've treated, my background, my opinions about the protests, or what I had for breakfast, anything goes :)

Here's a picture of my EMS vest along with my first aid certification in the cardholder, helmet, goggles, and 3M respirator as proof, let me know if you need more proof and I'll do my best to accommodate!

[https://truepic.com/rql7n74u/](https://truepic.com/rql7n74u/)

I will be answering questions as they keep coming in, so give me all ya got.

EDIT: Sorry for the clumsy title, I used the word protest 4 times in the same sentence oops

EDIT 2: I'm gonna go ahead and eat dinner, Ill be back to answering questions in an hour or so (7:42 PM HK time), thanks for all the questions so far guys!

EDIT 3:

A lot of people are asking me how I'm qualified to be a medic at 17. The word medic here is used loosely since Hong Kong people don't really see the term ""medic"" as anything more than ""person who gives medical assistance"" I'm sorry if that miscommunication led to some people thinking that I'm claiming to be a paramedic when I never was. I'm also going to give some details about my medical background as that seems to be an issue with a lot of people.

I am 17, and as soon as I was 13 my mom had started to push me to take medical and first aid related classes because (oh the stereotype) she wanted me to become a doctor. So I got my first aid certificate when I was 13. I gained a lot of interest in emergency medicine and I voluntarily signed up for a lot of different classes relating to medicine by various organizations (ITLS military + PHTLS). I had started providing event first aid with a local ambulance organization immediately after I got my first aid cert and started volunteering for the ambulance service when I turned 16. The highest certification I have is emergency medical responder, and I'm planning to get my EMT-B with a private organisation here as soon as I get enough money.

Is this enough qualification to be volunteering on the frontlines? I know a lot of people who have much less than me and a lot of people who have much more experience than me. Which is much like the situation with the protesters, some are there and are only willing to chant or sing, but others are there throwing molotovs and slinging shit at cops. But honestly, we're all just volunteers, and we're all just doing what we can to help the movement in the way that we can the best, and we're all stepping up cause we're all Hong Kongers.

**香港人，反抗**

EDIT 4:

If you guys want to donate to our cause these 3 methods are the best way to do it

* Donate directly to frontline medical teams and protesters (PM me and Ill get you in touch)
* Donate to legal aid organisations such as 星火聯盟 (FB Page:  [https://www.facebook.com/sparkalliancehk/](https://www.facebook.com/sparkalliancehk/)  message them and ask for ways to donate)
* Donate to local press organisations (Hong Kong Free Press, Apple Daily are good choices, Stand News I heard was in danger of running out of funds)
* Visit r/HongKong and read their pinned post

EDIT 5:

Due to an influx of people commenting and asking questions about HK, u/k0ella, u/Stand_With_HongKong and u/electr9 will be helping me answer some of them :)

I'll be heading off to take a break now, Ill continue answering later on if I can, Ill be focusing on replying to messages and DMs now :) Thanks for all the questions",2019-10-10 01:51:30

They were ""lucky"" to be sold as brides, not brothel workers.

One ran away and was brought home safely; the other two just disappeared. Nobody knew where they were, what had happened to them, or even if they were still alive.

I gave up everything and risked my life to find the girls in China. To everyone's surprise (including my own!), I did actually find them - but that was just the beginning.

Both of my friends had given birth in China. Still just teenagers, they faced a heartbreaking dilemma: each girl had to choose between her daughter and her own freedom.

For six years I've been a full-time volunteer with 'The Human, Earth Project', to help fight the global human trafficking crisis. Of its 40 million victims, most are women sold for sex, and many are only girls.

IamA survivor of Stalin’s Communist dictatorship and I'm back on the 100th anniversary of the Communist Revolution to answer questions.

After the killing of my father and my escape from the U.S.S.R. I am here to bear witness to the cruelties perpetrated in the name of the Communist ideology. 

2017 marks the 100th anniversary of the Communist Revolution in Russia. My latest book, ""[A Brief History of Communism: The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Empire](http://www.anatolekonstantin.com/communism/)"" is the story of the men who believed they knew how to create an ideal world, and in its name did not hesitate to sacrifice millions of innocent lives. 

The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, has said that the demise of the Soviet Empire in 1991 was the greatest tragedy of the twentieth century. My book aims to show that the greatest tragedy of the century was the creation of this Empire in 1917.

My grandson, Miles, is typing my replies for me.

"We're the reporters who found 100+ former politicians’ campaign accounts spending campaign donations years after the campaign was over — sometimes, even when the politician was dead.

We've spent just short of a year investigating ['zombie campaigns'](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2018/investigations/zombie-campaigns/spending-millions-after-office/): political campaign accounts that are still spending years after the politicians they were working to elect left office.

We found more than 100 former lawmakers spending campaign donations on things like cell phone bills, fancy dinners and luncheons, computers and an ipad, country club dues, and paying salary to family members – all after leaving office. Around half of the politicians we identified moved into a lobbying career when they retired allowing them to use those campaign accounts to curry favor for their new clients. Twenty of the campaign accounts were still active more than a decade after the candidate last sought office. Eight of the campaign accounts belonged to congressmen who had died but were still spending donations as if they were still running for office. In total, the zombie campaigns we identified have spent more than $20 million after leaving office.

It's not just small fish either. We found [Ron Paul paying his daughter $16k+](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2018/investigations/zombie-campaigns/spending-millions-after-office/database/#/?search=paul,%20ron) over the course of 5 years after he last campaigned in 2012. [He fled when our affiliates tried to ask him questions](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2018/investigations/zombie-campaigns/spending-millions-after-office/ron_paul.mp4) outside of the building where he records the Ron Paul Liberty Report. Kentucky Sen. [Jim Bunning paid his daughter almost $95k](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2018/investigations/zombie-campaigns/spending-millions-after-office/database/#/?search=bunning) since he retired. [Mark Foley](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2018/investigations/zombie-campaigns/spending-millions-after-office/database/#/?search=foley), who was forced out of office a decade ago amid allegations that he was sexting teenage boys, still spends campaign donations on posh luncheons and travel. Sen. [George LeMieux](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2018/investigations/zombie-campaigns/spending-millions-after-office/database/#/?search=lemieux) hasn't run for office since 2012, but spent [$41k+ on management consulting services](https://www.fec.gov/data/disbursements/?two_year_transaction_period=2016&data_type=processed&committee_id=C00494971&recipient_name=milano&min_date=01%2F01%2F2015&max_date=12%2F31%2F2016) and then [denied to us on camera](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2018/investigations/zombie-campaigns/spending-millions-after-office/g_lemieux.mp4) when we confronted him. Hawaiian political operative Dylan Beesley was a campaign advisor the for the late Rep. [Mark Takai](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2018/investigations/zombie-campaigns/spending-millions-after-office/database/#/?search=takai). A couple months after his death, papers filed with the FEC listed Beesley as the campaign treasurer. Over the course of 17 months since Takai's passing, Beesley has paid $100k+ out of the dead congressman's campaign to his own consulting firm for 'consulting services' rendered on the campaign of a dead man.

Thank you so much for all the great questions! I can tell by the questions that many people here care about the North Korean people and know that they are different from the regime. I wish I had more time to answer more questions but it is my last night in America before going back to South Korea and I want to eat some great NYC food! I will try to answer some questions later tonight if I have some time :) 

***Annyeonghaseyo!*** 

My name is Joy and I’m from North Korea. I escaped to China when I was 18 but was immediately trafficked and sold as a bride to a Chinese man for $3,000 USD. Life was difficult, but I gave birth to a daughter who became the joy of my life. After 2 years I was offered an opportunity to finally escape. I reached freedom through a 3,000-mile rescue route that brought me to Southeast Asia, and from there I flew to South Korea. Because the journey out of China is incredibly dangerous for North Koreans, I had to leave my daughter behind. I now live in South Korea and I am studying social work to help North Korean women who have also been trafficked. I hope to bring my daughter to South Korea to live with me one day. 

Because I have family in North Korea that could face punishment if my identity was revealed, I cannot share my real name or show my face.

I am joined today by Ian and Sarah of Liberty in North Korea (LiNK). Together, we are in NYC promoting LiNK’s new film [Sleep Well, My Baby](https://www.sleepwellmybaby.com/). It is a short film about a North Korean woman who was trafficked and sold in China, and it is based on the real stories of North Korean women like myself. I’m still learning English, so Sarah will be translating for me and Ian will be typing.

[Liberty in North Korea](https://www.libertyinnorthkorea.org/) is an international NGO dedicated to supporting the North Korean people. LiNK brings North Korean refugees through a 3,000-mile, modern-day 'underground railroad' to freedom and safety. To date they have rescued more than 700 North Korean refugees. These refugees drive change inside the country by sending money and outside information back to friends and family. LiNK also works to change the narrative on North Korea by producing documentaries, hosting events, and engaging with the international media to bring more focus to the North Korean people and the bottom-up changes they are driving in their country. The vision of LiNK is a free North Korea in our lifetimes.

"United Airlines sued me last year for creating Skiplagged, a site that saves consumers money on airfare by exposing secrets. Instead of shutting it down, United made Skiplagged go viral worldwide and supporters donated over $80,000! Today, there's no lawsuit and Skiplagged is still marching on. AMA",50438,3ux82r,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3ux82r/united_airlines_sued_me_last_year_for_creating/,3576,1448955270.0,"Update: reddit hug of death, try the [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.skiplagged) or [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/skiplagged-actually-cheap/id823443083) apps if website fails <3 . We're also hiring, particularly engineers to make Skiplagged better. Email apply@skiplagged.com if you're interested.

This is a followup to the [AMA I did last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2o831k/i_run_skiplagged_a_site_being_sued_by_united/), just after the federal lawsuit was filed.

Hey guys, I founded [Skiplagged](https://skiplagged.com). Skiplagged is like a regular airfare search engine except it also shows you fares other websites don't. Among those is something very controversial known as hidden-city. 

Basically, hidden-city is where your destination is a stopover; you'd simply leave the airport when you arrive at your destination. It turns out booking this way can save you hundreds of dollars on over 25% of common routes, especially in the USA. [New York to San Francisco example](http://i.imgur.com/Np06G1j.jpg). There are a few caveats, of course: (1) you'd have to book a round-trip as two one-ways (which Skiplagged handles automatically), (2) you can only have carry-ons, and (3) you may be breaking an agreement with the airlines known as contract of carriage, where it might say you can't miss flights on purpose.

While Skiplagged is aimed at being a traveller's best friend and does more than inform about hidden-city opportunities, hidden-city is what it became known for. In fact, many people even refer to missing flights on purpose as ""skiplagging"". United Airlines didn't like any of this. 

Around September of last year, United reached out trying to get me to stop. I refused to comply because of their sheer arrogance and deceitfulness. For example, United tried to use the contract of carriage. They insisted Skiplagged, a site that provides information, was violating the contract. Contract of carriage is an agreement between passengers and airlines...Skiplagged is neither. This was basically the case of a big corporation trying to get what they want, irrelevant of the laws.

Fast-forward two months to Nov 2014, United teamed up with another big corporation and filed a federal lawsuit. I actually found out I was being sued from a Bloomberg reporter, who reached out asking for my thoughts. As a 22 year old being told there's a federal lawsuit against me by multi-billion dollar corporations, my heart immediately sank. But then I remembered, I'm 22. At worst, I'll be bankrupt. In my gut, I believed educating consumers is good for society so I decided this was a fight worth having. They sent over a letter shortly asking me to capitulate. I refused.

Skiplagged was a self-funded side project so I had no idea how I was going to fund a litigation. To start somewhere, I created a GoFundMe page for people to join me in the fight. What was happening in the following weeks was amazing. First there was coverage from small news websites. Then cbs reached out asking me to be [on national tv](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/finding-cheap-airfare-made-easier-with-skiplagged-startup/). Then cnn reached out and [published an article](http://money.cnn.com/2014/12/29/news/united-orbitz-sue-skiplagged-22/). Overnight, my story started going viral worldwide like frontpage of reddit and trending on facebook. Then I was asked to go on more national tv, local tv, radio stations, etc. Newspapers all over the world started picking this up. United caused the streisand effect. Tens of millions of people now heard about what they're doing. This was so nerve-wracking! Luckily, people understood what I was doing and there was support from all directions. 

Fast-forward a couple of months, United's partner in the lawsuit dropped. Fast-forward a few more months to May 2015, a federal judge dropped the lawsuit completely. Victory? Sort of I guess. While now there's no lawsuit against Skiplagged, this is America so corporations like United can try again.

From running a business as an early twenties guy to being on national tv to getting sued by multi-billion dollar corporations to successfully crowdfunding, I managed to experience quite a bit. Given the support reddit had for me last year, I wanted to do this AMA to share my experience as a way of giving back to the community. 

**Also, I need your help.** 

The crowdfunding to fight the lawsuit led to donations of over $80,000. I promised to donate the excess, so in addition to your question feel free to suggest what charity Skiplagged should support with the remaining ~$23,000.

I will be participating in a Reddit AMA to answer any and all questions. I promise to answer all questions honestly, in totally open fashion, even when the answer is that I don’t have an answer to a specific question or that I don’t know enough to answer it. 

I recently shot an interview with Reddit as part of their new series **Formative**, in which I talk about the early days of Apple. You can watch it here:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrhmepZlCWY

The founding of Apple is often greatly misunderstood. I like clearing the air about those times. I like to talk about my ideas for entrepreneurs with humble starts, like we had. I have always cared deeply about youth and education, whether in or out of school. I fought being changed by Apple’s success. I never sought wealth or power, and in fact evaded it. I was able to finish my degree in EE&CS and to fulfill a lifelong goal to teach 5th graders (8 years, up to teaching 7 days a week, public schools, no press allowed). I try to reach audiences of high school and college and slightly beyond people because of how important those times were in my own development. What I taught was less important than motivating students to learn. Nothing can stop them in that case.

I’m still a gadgeteer at heart. I buy a lot of prominent gadgets, including different platforms of computers and mobile devices, because everything different excites me. I think about what I like and dislike about such things. I think about the course technology has taken since early PC days and what that implies about the future. I think often about possible negative aspects of what we’ve brought to the world. I try to develop totally independent ideas about a lot of things that are never heard in other places. That was my design style too.

I admire good engineers and teachers greatly, even though they are not treated as royalty or paid a fraction of other professions. I try to be a very middle level person and to live my life around normal fun people. I do many things to affect that I don’t consider myself more important than anyone else. I had my lifetime philosophies down by around age 20 and I am thankful for them. I never needed something like Apple to be happy.

Finally, I’m hosting the Silicon Valley Comic Con this weekend March 18 - 19th, so come check it out.  You can buy tickets [here](https://register.growtix.com/e/silicon_valley_comic_con).

I want to thank you all for taking the time to either ask questions or check out the answers.  I love doing these kind of things.  I think they're much more revealing than your average interview.  REDDIT is one of the greatest places for information about ... anything.  Literally anything.  

I'm heading to Boston tomorrow to go to the 7:30pm screening of Middle Man at the Boston Common 19 on Tremont Street.  I'll also by in NYC on Tuesday at the Empire Theater on 42nd to meet people at the 7:30pm (I think...if not around that time) where we'll also be doing a Q&A with me and director Ned Crowley.

Please check me out on The Late Late Show with Seth Meyers next Wednesday, the 14th.  Seth is one of the really good guys.  I love being on his show.

Again, thank you for all the great questions and taking the time out to spend with me.  I'm forever astounded and grateful for the love I'm shown every day.

EDIT 1: Hey everyone.  I have to do a phone interview at 11 PST.  I'll be back after we hang up.  In the mean time check out the trailer for Middle Man.  I promise you a thrilling, dark, funny ride with this film:

http://www.middlemanmovie.com/trailer-1/

Hey Reddit! 
Thank you for having me back! I think this is going to be my third AMA, so the answers should hopefully come a little faster this time. I have a new independent film called ""Middle Man""  which is opening in theaters today. It's a super dark comedy that I'm extremely proud of. It's been on the festival circuit (and has done very well!) so I'm sure a few people here may have already seen it. If so, no spoilers! Lol. 

In the film, I play a comedian named Lenny. When Lenny's mother suddenly dies, he quits his job and heads to Vegas in search of fame. He picks up a mysterious hitchhiker who lures him into a desert-town killing spree with dark and twisted result – as the bodies pile up, Lenny actually becomes funnier and funnier.

Here's a link to the trailer. I hope you like it! http://www.middlemanmovie.com/trailer-1/

2:20 PM - We are working on the laptops doing an online activity when we hear about 10-15 gunshots outside of our door. Everyone scatters and from about 25 kids, two groups were split in different corners. I was in the corner that is immediately to the right of the entrance, Nick was in the back right corner that could be immediately seen from the entrance. The group with Nick and Helena were trying to form a barricade with a cabinet and a computer cart (one that holds laptops and charges them) but without even 20 seconds to react, the shooter comes to our door and starts shooting through the window of the door. He was shooting at the corner that Nick and Helena were in as well as about 12 other students with them in that corner. Nick got caught in the fire and died immediately, Helena also got caught and died within seconds. I was in the opposite corner so I couldn't see his body because a cabinet was in the way, and I'm thankful that I didn't witness his body because it probably would have affected me much more. My classmate Aalayah told me she had to use Nick's body as a shield once she saw he was dead immediately :(

[Here is an edited version of the map](http://prntscr.com/ifnd5k) to show the corner where I was hiding (blue), where Nick and Helena were (orange) and where the shooter was shooting from (red). Thank you for the support you have been giving. And if any of you came out to the vigil yesterday, I have no words for how happy I am that you came to support.

I spent the last several months looking [into a psychiatric hospital that forcibly holds patients for days longer than allowed](https://projects.tampabay.com/projects/2019/investigations/north-tampa-behavioral-health/) while running up their medical bills. I found that North Tampa Behavioral Health uses loopholes in Florida’s mental health law to trap people at the worst moments of their lives. To piece together the methods the hospital used to hold people, I interviewed 15 patients, analyzed thousands of hospital admission records and read hundreds of police reports, state inspections, court records and financial filings. Read more about them in [the story](https://projects.tampabay.com/projects/2019/investigations/north-tampa-behavioral-health/).

In recent years, the hospital has been one of the [most profitable psychiatric hospitals in Florida](https://projects.tampabay.com/projects/2019/investigations/north-tampa-behavioral-health/#chartbuilder-export). It’s also stood out for its shaky safety record. The hospital told us it had 75 serious incidents (assaults, injuries, runaway patients) in the 70 months it has been open. Patients have been brutally attacked or allowed to attempt suicide inside its walls. It has also been cited by the state more often than almost any other psychiatric facility. 

Last year, it hired its fifth CEO in five years. Bryon “BJ” Coleman was a quarterback on the Green Bay Packers’ practice squad in 2012 and 2013, played indoor and Canadian football, was vice president of sales for a trucking company and consulted on employee benefits. He has no experience in healthcare. Now he runs the 126-bed hospital.

We also found that the hospital is part of a large chain of behavioral health facilities called Acadia Healthcare, which has had problems across the country. Our reporting on North Tampa Behavioral and Acadia is continuing. If you know anything, email me at [nbedi@tampabay.com](mailto:nbedi@tampabay.com).

I know I did not get around to all of them, but I will check back in and try to answer some more soon.  I have to leave now as I have lectures and gigs for which I must prepare and pack my bags as some of them are out of town.  Please feel free to visit my website and hit me on Facebook.

"Iama guy who purchased a 380 acre ‘ghost town’ with a friend. It once was California’s largest silver mine, has a population of 4500, and was known to have a murder a week. Currently it has a population of 1. AMA",46221,bf5z5q,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/bf5z5q/iama_guy_who_purchased_a_380_acre_ghost_town_with/,4877,1555746255.0,"Hello reddit!

My name is Brent and with my friend Jon purchased the former mining town of “Cerro Gordo” this past July 13th (Friday the 13th). The town was originally established in 1865 and by 1869 they were pulling 340 tons of bullion out of the mountain for Los Angeles. 

The silver from Cerro Gordo was responsible for building Los Angeles. The prosperity of Cerro Gordo demanded a larger port city and pushed LA to develop quickly.  

The Los Angeles News once wrote:

“What Los Angeles is, is mainly due to it. It is the silver cord that binds our present existence. Should it be uncomfortably severed, we would inevitably collapse.”

In total, there has been over $17,000,000 of minerals pulled from Cerro Gordo. Adjusted for inflation, that number is close to $500,000,000.

It’s been a wild ride so far owning a ‘ghost town’ and we’re having a lot of fun figuring out what to do with it.

Paperless voting machines are just waiting to be hacked in 2020. We are a POLITICO cybersecurity reporter and a voting security expert – ask us anything.,45455,cqrf7a,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/cqrf7a/paperless_voting_machines_are_just_waiting_to_be/,3605,1565911971.0,"Intelligence officials have repeatedly warned that Russian hackers will return to plague the 2020 presidential election, but the decentralized and underfunded U.S. election system has proven difficult to secure. While disinformation and breaches of political campaigns have deservedly received widespread attention, another important aspect is the security of voting machines themselves.

[Hundreds of counties still use paperless voting machines](https://www.politico.com/interactives/2019/election-security-americas-voting-machines/), which cybersecurity experts say are extremely dangerous because they offer no reliable way to audit their results. Experts have urged these jurisdictions to upgrade to paper-based systems, and lawmakers in Washington and many state capitals are considering requiring the use of paper. But in many states, the responsibility for replacing insecure machines rests with county election officials, most of whom have lots of competing responsibilities, little money, and even less cyber expertise.

To understand how this voting machine upgrade process is playing out nationwide, Politico surveyed the roughly 600 jurisdictions — including state and county governments — that still use paperless machines, asking them whether they planned to upgrade and what steps they had taken. The findings are stark: [More than 150 counties have already said that they plan to keep their existing paperless machines or buy new ones](https://www.politico.com/interactives/2019/election-security-americas-voting-machines/). For various reasons — from a lack of sufficient funding to a preference for a convenient experience — [America’s voting machines won’t be completely secure any time soon](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/05/election-security-cybersecurity-1445539).

A bit more about us:

**Eric Geller** is the POLITICO cybersecurity reporter behind this project. His beat includes cyber policymaking at the Office of Management and Budget and the National Security Council; American cyber diplomacy efforts at the State Department; cybercrime prosecutions at the Justice Department; and digital security research at the Commerce Department. He has also covered global malware outbreaks and states’ efforts to secure their election systems. His first day at POLITICO was June 14, 2016, when news broke of a suspected Russian government hack of the Democratic National Committee. In the months that followed, Eric contributed to POLITICO’s reporting on perhaps the most significant cybersecurity story in American history, a story that continues to evolve and resonate to this day.

Before joining POLITICO, he covered technology policy, including the debate over the FCC’s net neutrality rules and the passage of hotly contested bills like the USA Freedom Act and the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act. He covered the Obama administration’s IT security policies in the wake of the Office of Personnel Management hack, the landmark 2015 U.S.–China agreement on commercial hacking and the high-profile encryption battle between Apple and the FBI after the San Bernardino, Calif. terrorist attack. At the height of the controversy, he interviewed then-FBI Director James Comey about his perspective on encryption.

**J. Alex Halderman** is Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan and Director of Michigan’s Center for Computer Security and Society. He has performed numerous security evaluations of real-world voting systems, both in the U.S. and around the world. He helped conduct California’s “top-to-bottom” electronic voting systems review, the first comprehensive election cybersecurity analysis commissioned by a U.S. state. He led the first independent review of election technology in India, and he organized the first independent security audit of Estonia’s national online voting system. In 2017, he testified to the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence regarding Russian Interference in the 2016 U.S. Elections. Prof. Halderman regularly teaches computer security at the graduate and undergraduate levels. He is the creator of Security Digital Democracy, a massive, open, online course that explores the security risks—and future potential—of electronic voting and Internet voting technologies.

About a decade ago I quit my civil engineering job and spent 5 months walking 3,100 miles across the United States, from Rockaway Beach, NYC, to Rockaway Beach, Oregon.

I don't have a particular goal or focus when I'm walking. I just try to pay attention to whatever's around me. It's amazing how much there is to see everywhere, whether you're in the middle of North Dakota, Staten Island, or Times Square. It just takes a long time to open your eyes to it all.

**Another edit!**

Since many of you had questions about art-related stuff, you might be interested in taking part in the fan art contest: http://www.acidwizardstudio.com/?p=726


**---**

We're Acid Wizard Studio, three college buddies (and a dog) from Poland who teamed up and decided to make a game. After more than 4 years of development, we have finished work on Darkwood, a unique top-down survival horror that does not rely on jump scares.

Before Darkwood, some of us literally could not sit through some of the classics of the genre. While developing the game, we managed to slowly overcome our fear of playing horror games or even watching scary movies. We can now finally play Amnesia: The Dark Descent (at least in broad daylight ;))

We knew next to nothing about game development before starting work on Darkwood. We all had a background in animation / graphic design, but we had little idea about programming, game design or production. At one point, we sat down and declared we hate our current jobs, and instead of talking all the time about making the game of our dreams, we have to just go and make one.

After a lot of sleepless nights, we had a vertical slice (kind of) of the game in 2013. We made a gameplay trailer using it, and the reactions to it blew away all of our expectations. We thought that we could actually make a living out of making video games, and started a Indiegogo campaign later that year to help us fund completing Darkwood. The campaign was not going well, but a second gameplay trailer wich launched during its last week gave us a big boost, and the campaign was a success. We set a deadline to complete the game by 2014.

Unfortunately, our inexperience in game development led to heavily overshooting that date. We expanded the scope of the game, and made some major changes to the core design of the game late in development, which ate up a lot of time. We were forced to launch in Steam Early Access in 2014. The game was received very well by the players, and sold much more than we expected! Encouraged by this... We decided to expand the scope of the game even more!

After that, even though we committed our lives to finishing the game as soon as possible, we continued to miss every deadline we set for ourselves. Negative reviews started popping up from players discouraged by the slow development or thinking we have abandoned the game. Development was very slow and frustrating. We bit off way more than we could chew, but we knew we had something special in our hands, and we had to complete it in the way we envisioned it. After 3 years of hard, hard work, the game is finished, and we're pretty proud of it.

Rather than give up, I bought four books from Amazon and spent the next few months learning how. A few months later, some of the hockey sales staff teamed up with me to get our prototype off the ground and together we now operate a small software company.

The idea was to create a crowd-sourced light show by synchronizing smartphone flashlights you see at concerts to the beat of the music. You can check out a [video of one of our light shows here](https://cueaudio.com/events/) at the Villanova-Purdue men’s basketball game two months ago. Basically, it works by using high-pitched, inaudible sound waves in a similar way that Bluetooth uses electromagnetic waves. All the devices in this video are getting their instructions from the music and could be in airplane mode. This means that the software can even be used to relay data to or synchronize devices through your television or computer. Possible uses range from making movies interactive with your smartphone, to [turning your $10 speaker into an iBeacon](https://vimeo.com/200193202) (interactive video if you’re watching on a laptop).  

If you’re interested in using this in your own apps, or are curious and want to read more, check out a [detailed description of the app software here](https://cueaudio.com/technology/).

Overall, I’ve been very lucky with how everything has turned out so far and wanted to share my experience in the hopes that it might help others who are looking to make their ideas a reality.

over a year ago, an anonymous source contacted the *Süddeutsche Zeitung* (SZ) and submitted encrypted internal documents from Mossack Fonseca, a Panamanian law firm that sells anonymous offshore companies around the world. 

Ultimately, SZ acquired about 2.6 terabytes of data, making the leak the biggest that journalists had ever worked with. The source wanted neither financial compensation nor anything else in return, apart from a few security measures. The *Süddeutsche Zeitung* decided to analyze the data in cooperation with the *International Consortium of Investigative Journalists* (ICIJ). In the past 12 months, around 400 journalists from more than 100 media organizations in over 80 countries have taken part in researching the documents. 

We are three of them, and very happy to finally be able to talk about the work we did in the last year!

AMA Request: EACommunityTeam,40012,7cmu8c,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/7cmu8c/ama_request_eacommunityteam/,3746,1510605887.0,"IT HAPPENED. ITS OVER.


Edit: Seems that this will be indeed happening Wednesday! To all the haters who said they’d never do it, I cordially invite you to suck it. Thank you EA for actually listening to your community and doing this AMA. Thank you everyone who upvoted this thread and made our voices heard! It’s awesomely empowering to actually get a response from a corporate monolith like EA based on a post like this. This is what happens when we rally as a community!!

Look, while we all have fun shitting on EA (because, well, they’re pretty notoriously bad) I’d like to genuinely hear their side of the story and give them a chance to defend some of their (really confusing) choices. After becoming the account with the  most-downvoted comment of all Reddit history that I could find (almost -200k at the time of this post) I think it would be really interesting to try and hear their side. 

Edit: comment is now over -400k downvotes. 

So, u/EACommunityTeam 

1. How will your company change your PR strategy in the face of such harsh public backlash? Any decent PR team would know that the Reddit hate is just the tip of the iceberg. People have hated your company for years. 
2. Will your team actually change the way micro-transactions are handled in games? How do you think that would end up affecting the whole industry? Most players seem to think it would be a positive change. Do you disagree and can you give us a convincing reason why?
3. How do you respond to the allegations that banned user Mat is still the one behind your account? 
4. Has the company suffered a noticeable amount of cancelled preorders/lost sales in the wake of this event? Essentially, are micro-transactions actually backfiring and losing net revenue because people just won’t buy the games anymore? How much longer do you think this can go on before you have a revolt on your hands and a massive flop of an otherwise good game, simply because people are sick of micro transactions?
5. How do you justify micro transactions? You’ve already paid for the game. Why should you have to pay more for loot boxes and characters? What happened to just unlocking it by getting good? 
6. Probably the most beloved gaming company you’ll see online is CD Projeckt Red. What can you learn from their business model to improve your own? Will you consider how their PR strategy is working infinitely better than your own and consider how, in light of that, you could improve your own?
7. What is it like working for a company that so many people hate? Do you get crap from gamer cousins at Thanksgiving? How does the company as a whole seem to be reacting to this bad press?
8. What happened to single player gaming at EA? Is it just a matter of profit? Is profit really the only driving factor in making games, or does it just seem that way to an outside source? How do you plan on changing that perception if your company does care about the quality of their product beyond its ability to generate revenue?
9. What do you feel you have to contribute to the conversation? Is there anything you’d like to know from your playerbase that could help you make better games? Did your team even realize how deep the hate against EA went, or did it just seem like a passing internet fad? 

If your PR team deems this acceptable, u/EACommunityTeam , I would love to hear from you. I’m guessing a few other downvoters would too. 


Edit: a few other questions I’ve seen come up more than once, and to increase the amount of “neutral” questions as suggested by several people:

10. What about Skate 4 Boy?
11. What about the expansion of mobile sports gaming? ",2017-11-14 04:44:47
I'm dying at 33 from liver cancer as the result of a rare genetic disease and accidentally roused a massive campaign to help me see Avengers: Endgame early.

Unless it's about contact between myself and Disney. I'll answer ""Disney reached out and we're discussing options"".

A post of [mine] (https://twitter.com/alexand63802267) in [r/marvelstudios] (https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/actrm0/dying_before_april_my_endgame/) evolved into a greater conversation about death and dying, and became the focus of a campaign for me to see Avengers Endgame before I die using the Avengers4Alexander hashtag. It worked - Disney have since contacted me.

I have Fanconi Anemia (FA) which interferes with my body's DNA repair. I've survived mouth cancer so far, but now face liver cancer and the threat of bone marrow failure. I get most of my nutrition through a PEG feeding tube because my mouth doesn't work well.

My sister died from the same disease but she was never diagnosed with FA while alive. I devote a lot of my time now to try and raise awareness about my disease by doing interviews, and help direct people to donate to research for a cure.

My hope is that at the least, people like my sister will get diagnosed before they undertake dangerous treatment, and at most that a cure will be created.

You can donate to the Fanconi Anemia Research Fund at www.fanconi.org/donate or to the Leukaemia Foundation at www.leukaemia.org.au/get-involved/make-a-donation/

"I found my kidnapped friends in China, and am now finishing a documentary on it - AMA!",38410,5arqpo,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5arqpo/i_found_my_kidnapped_friends_in_china_and_am_now/,1850,1478141354.0,"I'm a filmmaker and human rights activist. 5 years ago, 3 of my friends were kidnapped from Vietnam and trafficked into China. My friends were ""lucky"" - they were forced into marriage, not prostitution. They were 16 years old. 

After just a few months, one of my friends took her ""husband's"" phone and ran away. She was brought home safely. My other 2 friends just disappeared. I didn't know where they were, what had happened to them, or even if they were still alive. 

I gave up everything to investigate my friends' disappearances, and risked my life to try and find them in China - the world's most populous country, with over 1.357 billion people (more than 4x the population of the US!). After 5 months of searching, to everyone's surprise, I actually did find them. 

It was more than I'd ever hoped for - but that was just the beginning. By the time I found them, each of my 2 friends had given birth in China, and had to make a decision no mother should ever have to make: the choice between her child and her own freedom. 

I'm now sharing my friends' story as a documentary to raise awareness of the global human trafficking crisis, and to help protect vulnerable girls in Vietnam.

PROOF: You can find proof (and more information) on the front page of my website at http://www.humanearth.net

We're running a crowdfunding project to finish the documentary here: https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/sisters-for-sale-a-human-trafficking-documentary/

EDIT: I can't even remember how many hours we've been here - is it 3? 4? - but my mind is melting. I'll answer a couple more questions then wrap it up. You've been wonderful - thank you for all your great questions, your upvotes, and all the support you've given - it really makes a difference. If you haven't checked out the documentary, it's available until the weekend, when our fundraising campaign ends: http://www.sistersforsale.com

For those of you who still have questions, you'll find plenty of information on my blog - Oct/Nov 2014, June 2015 and Oct 2016 may be of particular interest: http://www.humanearth.net/blog/history/

This allows students to easily compare prices from services like Amazon and Chegg instead of being forced into the inflated bookstore markup.  Though students are increasingly aware of third-party options, many are still dependent on the campus bookstore because they control the information for which textbooks are required by course.

Here's a [GIF](http://i.imgur.com/pj0mCxG.gif) of it in action.

We've been asked to remove the extension by Follett, a $2.7 billion company that services over 1700+ college bookstores.  Instead of complying, we rebuilt the extension from the ground up and re-branded it as #OccupyTheBookstore, as the user is literally occupying their website to find cheaper deals.

Ask us anything about the textbook industry, the lack of legal basis for Follett's threats, etc., and if you're a college student, be sure to try out the extension for yourself!

I had no idea what reddit was at the time, but I suddenly had huge interest in my artwork and a massive amount of support from the community.

During all those years I was working as working in a big corporate conglomerate in their financial insurance arm (blegh) but earning well while painting on the side.  Despite a healthy promotion and the security that came with the job, I decided to quit almost exactly two years ago and pursue art full time…and it has turned out more than ok! 

I’m now happier than I have ever been, eating moderately premium ramen, and have my first international solo exhibition happening in Nov!

We’re sitting here with our Opa for the next two or three hours to hopefully answer some questions from you about his time during and around the second world war. 


We asked him to do this AmaA because for us it is very important to archieve the important experiences from that time and to not forget what has happened. He is a very active man, still doing some hunting (in his backyard), shooting game and being active in the garden. After our grandmother died in 2005, he picked up cooking, doing a course for cooking with venison (his venison cevapcici and venison meat cut into strips are super delicious) and started to do some crafting. 

Our Opa was born in 1927 in a tiny village in Lower Saxony near the border to North-Rhine-Westphalia. He was a Luftwaffe auxiliary personnel in Osnabrück with 14/15 years for 9 months and helped during the air raids against Osnabrück at that time. 


Afterwards he had 3 months of Arbeitsdienst (Labour Service) near the city of Rheine. Following that at the end of December 1944 he was drafted in as a soldier. He applied to be a candidate reserve officer which meant that he was not send to the front line immediately. He came to the Ruhr area for training and was then transferred to Czechoslovakia for further training. His life as a soldier lasted for half a year after which he was caught and send to Romania and then to Rostov-on-Don for four and a half years as a prisoner of war. During that time he worked in a factory and he had to take part in political education in a city called Taganrog where they were educated on the benefits of communism and stalinism. They had to sign a paper that they would support communism when they would go back home.


He came back home in 1949 and went to an agricultural school. During his time on the farm where he was in training, he met our grandmother. They married in 1957 despite her mother not being happy about the marriage. He didn’t have enough farmland, in her opinion. They had six kids, including our mother, and nowadays 13 grandchildren.

"[Update on yesterday's Apollo SPCA fundraiser AMA] We raised $27,355 yesterday. TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. The SPCA told me it's their largest single day fundraiser IN THEIR HISTORY. Thank you so much for the AMA, we have made such a difference in the lives of so many animals. Floored. 🐶🐱🐰",35847,cg18r3,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/cg18r3/update_on_yesterdays_apollo_spca_fundraiser_ama/,460,1563757294.0,"I legitimately have no idea how to start this and I refreshed the page a few different times over the course of 10 minutes to make sure I was seeing the right number.

I make a free Reddit app for iOS called [Apollo for Reddit](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id979274575), and yesterday you might have saw I [posted a little fundraiser here](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/cfmlca/i_build_the_apollo_reddit_app_and_im_donating_100/) in the Apple subreddit basically stating all the proceeds for the day from Apollo (it's a free app but has some in-app purchases for some cool extra Pro/Ultra features) will go to the my local SPCA animal shelter in Nova Scotia. It's definitely the hardest time of the year for them right now, because cats give birth in tremendous numbers in these warm months (dubbed Kitten Season) which creates a massive influx of orphaned and abandoned kitties, and shelters are seriously strained and need all the help they can get.

I was hoping to do some good for the shelter, but legitimately in my wildest dreams I did not expect so many people to come out and give support, I'm truly unable to form cohesive thoughts right now. They are legitimately such great people at that shelter, just for one example we recently had a cat in the community who was found badly abused and they looked after her, helped her with her bad leg (it ended up requiring an amputation) and [now Phoebe got adopted into a loving home](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/phoebe-cape-breton-cat-shot-adoption-1.5201865). Like that's just one example.

I also got my two cats Ruby and Hugo from there. Here's Ruby spinning in circles in delight when I told her: https://i.imgur.com/QWyckgy.gifv and here's Hugo somewhat annoyed I woke him up to tell him but undoubtedly stoked inside: https://i.imgur.com/S5ztw0T.gifv

Here's a tally of the donations. It came mostly from proceeds for the day but also was helped immensely by people commenting ($0.10 per comment on the AMA as well as the r/Apple thread) and retweeting, as well as awesome PayPal and crypto donations. It's easiest to show the breakdown/proof with a pic: 

Pic: https://i.imgur.com/YLjn7da.png

I'm working with them to get the money over to them. I was legitimately not expecting to hit anywhere near this much, so I thought my credit cards would do but I don't have a limit high enough to pay this much in one go, so I sent over $16,000, which is all my cards could handle, and I promise I'll get the rest over as soon as I can figure that out (SPCA said it was totally okay, and Apple doesn't pay until the following month, so it's not as if I have the money right now). Proof of $16K (we're over half way there): https://i.imgur.com/Jyeg7QK.png

(And before anyone asks, as much as I wish it was, this is extraordinarily far far far far more than Apollo makes on a normal day obviously.)

Like this is absolutely nuts, I actually can't believe or wrap my head around that we raised this much money. We actually broke records. Like seriously, here's the most recent (2017) [document I could find on their donors](http://www.novascotiaspca.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ANNUAL-REPORT-2017.pdf). Walmart donated $2,000 - $5,000 (which is amazing). Not that it's a competition (every donor is a hero), but we did 5-10x more than WALMART for reference! How are we that awesome. I talked to them this morning and they said they were crying.

You have made my week, month, year, everything with this generosity. If you got Apollo Pro or Ultra yesterday I genuinely hope you love it and I'll continue to work my tail off to create the best Reddit app possible for all of you. Thank you so much again.

I tried to answer as many questions as I humanly could (my wrists legitimately ache right now) but in the spirit of the subreddit if you have any further questions I'll happily answer them haha!

"My best friend and I quit our jobs, raised $17,656, and worked 3 years to make our dream game! Ruin of the Reckless released on April 26th! AMA!",35848,683tt8,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/683tt8/my_best_friend_and_i_quit_our_jobs_raised_17656/,2492,1493426848.0,"**EDIT: Hello everyone! We are packing things up. I believe we actually successfully answered almost every single question between me and Danny!  Sorry if we missed yours! Thank you all for the support and for throwing some light on the game. We will do our best to support the game in every way we can and live up to your expectations! We're out, thank you!**

Hello. My name is Charles Webb. Three years ago, while working IT for a small software company and binge playing Samurai-Gunn with my closest friends in much of my off time, I started working with one of them (Daniel Crockenberg.) Inspired by the wonderfully crafted combat mechanics of Samurai Gunn, we set out to make a punchy, fast paced dungeon-crawler with the depth and complexity of a fighting game!

Over time the community around the game grew enthusiastic enough that we decided we had to take the chance. We quit our jobs and began working on it full time. (Note: This is certainly usually a very bad idea!)

We decided to call the game 'Ruin of the Reckless', mostly as a reference to our sorry financial situation and the foolishness of our decision to make it. Hehe, get it!?

About two years later, we planned and launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise the funds necessary to complete the game 'for real.' It was successful, largely due to the strength of our playable 'Backers Only' Build, which became popular with streamers like Tietuesday.

Edit: We've gotten a lot of questions about this whole thing specifically so I want to put this in OP for more clarity...

**""Sorry, there is a slight lack of clarity in my post here.
We worked on the game for about 2 years part-time BEFORE the Kickstarter. After the Kickstarter we worked for about 7 months before the game was released. ALL of our living expenses were paid out of our own finances/savings, Kickstarter money was only spent on game assets, contractor fees, etc...
We certainly didn't live for that entire time without any income!""**

Since then it has been non-stop work up to today putting the game together for our backers and the community at large. Over the course of development we have been through Steam Greenlight, conducted a successful Kickstarter campaign, been featured on several popular streams and youtube channels (including Tietuesday, DreadedCone, and TotalBiscuits wildly popular Co-Optional Podcast), met with major publishers, built a humble following of almost 2000 indie die-hards on twitter, signed on to and maintained contracts with almost 20 artists and musicians, been featured on many indie-gaming and videogaming news sites including Co-Optimus and well, a LOT of other stuff! It has really been quite a ride to get to this point!

I am also very proud and excited to say that we were recently accepted by GOG.com and will be included in to their curated store. To me this is a great honor and a validation of all of the hard work we have put in so far!

On release day we were featured on the front page of gog.com as well as the front page of the itch.io store. It remains to be seen whether we can crack the top sellers list on Steam but i'm crossing my fingers! We spent the first day on and near the top of the popular new releases page on Steam so release has gone well so far! (proof: https://twitter.com/FauxOperative/status/857426940889767936)

Other then the kidneys this disease also affect my hearing (only in men tho) so I also have about 30% hearing left and hearing aids

Smart was abducted on June 5, 2002, and her captors controlled her by threatening to kill her and her family if she tried to escape. Fortunately, the police safely returned Elizabeth back to her family on March 12, 2003 after being held prisoner for nine grueling months.

Marking the 15th anniversary of Smart’s harrowing childhood abduction, A E and Lifetime will premiere a cross-network event that allows Smart to tell her story in her own words. A E’s Biography special [“Elizabeth Smart: Autobiography”](http://www.aetv.com/shows/autobiography) premieres in two 90-minute installments on Sunday, November 12 and Monday, November 13 at 9PM ET/PT. The intimate special allows Smart to explain her story in her own words and provides previously untold details about her infamous abduction. Lifetime’s Original Movie [“I Am Elizabeth Smart”](http://www.mylifetime.com/movies/i-am-elizabeth-smart) starring Skeet Ulrich (Riverdale, Jericho), Deirdre Lovejoy (The Blacklist, The Wire)  and Alana Boden (Ride) premieres Saturday, November 18 at 8PM ET/PT. Elizabeth serves as a producer and on-screen narrator in order to explore how she survived and confront the truths and misconceptions about her captivity.

The Elizabeth Smart Foundation was created by the Smart family to provide a place of hope, action, education, safety and prevention for children and their families wherever they may be, who may find themselves in similar situations as the Smarts, or who want to help others to avoid, recover, and ultimately thrive after they’ve been traumatized, violated, or hurt in any way.

Just days left to kill mass surveillance under Section 215 of the Patriot Act. We are Edward Snowden and the ACLU’s Jameel Jaffer.

A poll released by the ACLU this week shows that a majority of Americans from across the political spectrum are deeply concerned about government surveillance. Lawmakers need to respond.

The pressure is on Congress to do exactly that, because Section 215 of the Patriot Act is set to expire on June 1. Now is the time to tell our representatives that America wants its privacy back. 

Senator Mitch McConnell has introduced a two-month extension of Section 215 – and the Senate has days left to vote on it. Urge Congress to let Section 215 die by:

Calling your senators: https://www.aclu.org/feature/end-government-mass-surveillance

Thank you all so much for the questions. I wish we had time to get around to all of them. For the people asking ""what can we do,"" the TL;DR is to call your senators for the next two days and tell them to reject any extension or authorization of 215. No matter how the law is changed, it'll be the first significant restriction on the Intelligence Community since the 1970s -- but only if you help.

That's it for the bonus round. Thank you again for all of the questions, and seriously, if the idea that the government is keeping a running tab of the personal associations of everyone in the country based on your calling data, please call 1-920-END-4-215 and tell them ""no exceptions,"" you are against any extension -- for any length of time -- of the unlawful Section 215 call records program. They've have two years to debate it and two court decisions declaring it illegal. It's time for reform.

Ask Us Anything!,34859,7k0rr1,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/7k0rr1/we_are_the_washington_post_reporters_who_broke/,5663,1513384207.0,"We are Stephanie McCrummen, Beth Reinhard and Alice Crites of The Washington Post, and we broke [the story of sexual misconduct allegations against Roy Moore](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/woman-says-roy-moore-initiated-sexual-encounter-when-she-was-14-he-was-32/2017/11/09/1f495878-c293-11e7-afe9-4f60b5a6c4a0_story.html?utm_term=.6a246f4f556f), who ran and lost a bid for the U.S. Senate seat for Alabama. 

Stephanie and Beth both star in the [first in our video series “How to be a journalist,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySznIfN0pXY) where they talk about how they broke the story that multiple women accused Roy Moore of pursuing, dating or sexually assaulting them when they were teenagers.
 
Stephanie is a national enterprise reporter for The Washington Post. Before that she was our East Africa bureau chief, and counts Egypt, Iraq and Mexico as just some of the places she’s reported from. She hails from Birmingham, Alabama.
 
Beth Reinhard is a reporter on our investigative team. She’s previously worked at The Wall Street Journal, National Journal, The Miami Herald and The Palm Beach Post.
 
Alice Crites is our research editor for our national/politics team and has been with us since 1990. She previously worked at the Congressional Research Service at the Library of Congress.

Q: [If a person has been sexually assaulted by a public figure, what is the best way to approach the media? What kind of information should they bring forward?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/7k0rr1/we_are_the_washington_post_reporters_who_broke/draprn1/)

Q: [When was the first allegation brought to your attention?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/7k0rr1/we_are_the_washington_post_reporters_who_broke/drap8q2/) 

>[October.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/7k0rr1/we_are_the_washington_post_reporters_who_broke/draphq5/) 

Q: What about Beverly Nelson and the yearbook?
 
>[We reached out to Gloria repeatedly to try to connect with Beverly but she did not respond. Family members also declined to talk to us. So we did not report that we had confirmed her story.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/7k0rr1/we_are_the_washington_post_reporters_who_broke/draqkej/)

Q: [How much, if any, financial compensation does the publication give to people to incentivize them to come forward?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/7k0rr1/we_are_the_washington_post_reporters_who_broke/drb4ztw/?context=3)
 
>This question came up after the AMA was done, but unequivocally the answer is none. It did not happen in this case nor does it happen with any of our stories. The [Society of Professional Journalists advises against what is called ""checkbook journalism,""](https://www.spj.org/ethics-papers-cbj.asp) and it is also strictly against Washington Post policy. 

Q: What about net neutrality?

>[We are hosting another AMA on r/technology this Monday, Dec. 18 at noon ET/9 a.m. PST.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/7k0rr1/we_are_the_washington_post_reporters_who_broke/drax4ra/) It will be with reporter Brian Fung ([proof](https://twitter.com/b_fung/status/941780766387732481)), who has been covering the issue for years, longer than he can remember. Net neutrality and the FCC is covered by the business/technology section, thus Brian is our reporter on the beat.

1. Not all Vice Presidents take on such an 'active' role in the governing process as you seemed to. Was that something you were specifically encouraged to do, or simply always intended to and it just worked out well?
2. What would you consider your best, or perhaps most important, accomplishment in public service during your time as VP?
3. Without sharing anything too personal or otherwise untoward, what was your most memorable 'private' moment with President Obama that had nothing to do with your respective offices?
4. What sort of advice might you be able to give to those dealing with loss or tragedy in their own families, and if you are comfortable doing so, shed some light on how you dealt with it despite such public attention.
5. Knowing what you know now and having a front row seat to the Office of the Presidency for 8 years...if given the chance to do it all again, would you still run for President yourself?

[AMA Request] Any Sinclair news anchor featured in a recent front page story about monopolization of the media.,34403,88mt69,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/88mt69/ama_request_any_sinclair_news_anchor_featured_in/,1466,1522569655.0,"Video for context: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWLjYJ4BzvI&feature=youtu.be

**My 5 Questions:**

1. Does this type of ""reporting"" threaten our Democracy?
2. Do you feel this type of journalism compromises your integrity as a journalist?
3. What, if any, do you see as options career wise to working for Sinclair?
4. Is deregulation a good thing for American media?
5. Do you use social media to report on the news?

Front Page Edit: Thanks r/iama for popping my front page cherry. This is an issue I first really became aware of when John Oliver ran a piece on it a while back. Sinclair is not the only media company that seeks to monopolize media markets, but they're by far the largest and most insidious. I honestly have no idea how to combat this in our current political environment, but I think (If you're in the US) contacting your representative and senator and just leaving a short message or personally written email saying that they need to get rid of Ajit Pai and restore regulation on media ownership is a good start. Voting for politicians who have taken a position against media deregulation is the next step - if those in office now won't represent our interests we replace them with those who will. 

I still hope that one of these anchors can contact the mods and set up an AMA.

1. Why was CBD Oil ruled a Schedule 1 drug? Please be specific in your response, including cited sources and conclusive research that led you to believe CBD oil is as dangerous and deadly as heroin or meth. 
2. With more and more states legalizing marijuana / hemp, and with more and more proof that it has multiple medical benefits and a super low risk of dependency, why do you still enforce it as a schedule 1 drug?
3. How do you see your agency enforcing federal marijuana laws once all 50 states have legalized both recreationally and medically, as the trend shows will happen soon? 
4. There is no evidence that anyone has died directly as a result of ""overdosing"" on marijuana - but yet alcohol kills thousands each year. Can you please explain this ruling using specific data and/or research as to why alcohol is ranked as less of a danger than marijuana? 
5. If hemp could in theory reduce our dependencies on foreign trade for various materials, including paper, medicine, and even fuel, why does your agency still rule it as a danger to society, when it has clearly been proven to be a benefit, both health-wise and economically? 

EDIT: WOW! Front page in just over an hour. Thanks for the support guys. Keep upvoting! 

EDIT 2: Many are throwing speculation that this is some sort of ""karma whore"" post - and that my questions are combative or loaded. I do have a genuine interest in speaking to someone with a brain in the DEA, because despite popular opinion, I'd like to think that someone would contribute answers to my questions. As for the ""combativeness"" - yes, I am quite frustrated with DEA policy on marijuana (I'm not a regular user at all, but I don't support their decision to keep it illegal - like virtually everyone else with a brainstem) but they are intended to get right to the root of the issue.

Edit 1: to add links.

**Edit 2: Responding to the popular question: ""Why does CISA keep returning?""**

*Especially with ever worse data breaches and cybersecurity problems, members of Congress are feeling pressure to take some action to help in the area. They want to be able to say they did something for cybersecurity, but lobbyists and the intelligence community are pushing bad bills like CISA. Surveillance defenders like Sen. Richard Burr are also using every procedural tool available to them to help move these bills quickly (like holding meetings to discuss the bill in secret). They'll keep doing it until we win overwhelmingly and make the bill toxic for good, like we did with SOPA. That's why it's important that everyone takes action and ownership of this fight. We know it's easy to feel frustrated, but it's incredibly important for people to know how much their calls, emails...and faxes in this case, really matter. Congress wants to focus on things people are paying attention to. It's our job to make sure they know people are paying attention to CISA. We couldn't do it without all of you.*

Edit 3: The east coast organizations have signed off for the day, but will be checking in every now and then to answer questions. Nadia and I will continue through 6pm PT. Afterwards, all of us will be checking this post over the next few days trying to answer any remaining questions. Thanks for all the support!

1. What do you intend to do to rectify the recent happenings?

2. What direction do you intend to now take with Reddit as a whole entity?

3. What was the motivation behind the sacking of Victoria?

4. How do you intend to fill the job that she did and how will you work to fix what damage has been done?

5. With the community threatening to leave (and already starting to) how do you intend to make us trust you and the rest of the Admins again? And how are you going to prove it to us?

______________________________________

Edit: Further discussion:

We haven't had a chance to hear your side of the story. You have stayed pretty silent since the news broke. The community is currently sinking with pitchforks in hand yet you stand by and watch from a distance. This isn't helping you case so we need explanations.

We've had people come forward telling us how wonderful Victoria was. And people come forward and tell use how hard it was to work with you. (Current AMA going on with a former Reddit employee and you firing him)

You need to answer questions and you need to explain yourself before you become a dinosaur to be left alone.

The abduction changed my life forever in many ways, including creating an opportunity for a [better life](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/katie-beers-kidnapping-allowed-me-to-escape-abuse/). [After my abduction](http://abcnews.go.com/US/dungeons-katie-beers-girls-held/story?id=18222603), I was placed in a foster home, where I should have been for years, receiving love, support, stability, structure and psychological care.  

I authored [Buried Memories](http://www.buriedmemories.com) to share my never-before-told true story of survival and recovery which quickly became a New York Times best-seller. I, at the center of a national media storm, dropped out of sight 25 years ago and until 5 years ago when my book Buried Memories was released, had never spoken publicly about my story. I released my book Buried Memories in January 2013 and have had subsequent media appearances in People, Newsday, Dr. Phil, Jeff Probst Show, Anderson Cooper, Nancy Grace, The View, Crime Watch Daily, and others over the years, speaking about my story of survival and recovery.  

I grew up in a world where abuse was swept under the rug, and not reported. Abuse wasn’t reported because the community didn’t know it was happening, abuse wasn’t reported because the community turned a blind eye, ignored it, didn’t report it, or didn’t know WHERE to report it.

Now an inspirational speaker, I feel blessed to share my story of recovery to the world. I’ve spoken at numerous conferences, summits, and workshops around the country in hope that other children can grow up in a world where people are aware of abuse and neglect warning signs and to help others with their own recovery.

We’re going to be the first U.S. astronauts to launch from America since 2011. We’re excited to be launching a new era in American spaceflight with NASA’s partners, Boeing and SpaceX. Those companies are developing the Starliner spacecraft, which will launch atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket, and the Crew Dragon capsule launching atop the Falcon 9 rocket, respectively. These American-made spacecraft will be the first to launch from American soil to the International Space Station since NASA retired its Space Shuttle Program in 2011.

It is clear that Saddam Hussein ordered this genocide, but he did not do it alone. A lawsuit based on new evidence and testimony from experts hired by the German Export Authority alleges that some of Europe’s largest corporations entered into a conspiracy to build and try to hide the purpose of the chemical weapons facilities Saddam Hussein used to carry out this genocide.

Two people who survived the attack –a man who was 19 at the time, who still suffers from respiratory disability, and a young girl who was orphaned and blinded – are plaintiffs in this case, members of the Halabja Chemical Victims Society, and will be joining Reddit for an AMA about the lawsuit, 30th anniversary of the attack, and the need to hold corporations like those that built Saddam’s chemical weapons accountable.

**Answering the AMA today are two survivors. Because of language and disability, their answers may come a little more slowly than other AMAs:**


**Aras Abid Akram** was 19 years old during the attack. Prior to the attack, he worked as a retailer selling drinks imported from Baghdad. He lost ten members of his family in the attack, including his parents and eight siblings. He was transferred to Iran for treatment and stayed there for 6 months. Upon returning to Iraq, he had to stay in a complex prepared by the Saddam Regime for people who survived in the attack in Halabja. He still suffers from lung disabilities and eye disease.

**Mardin Mahmood Fatah** was 4 years old on the day of the attack. She was severely burned and lost her vision because of the poisonous gases.  She was hospitalized in Tehran, Iran for more than 3 months and lost her consciousness for a period of time.  She was taken in by a family in Iran and lived with them for 10 years. After the father of that family died, she was informed that she was not his daughter, and not part of the family.  She returned to Iraq to search for her true family and later found out that her true mother and brother were killed by the chemical weapons in the attack.  Her father, who had married another woman and had a new family, refused to bring her into his household.  As the education she received in Iran was fundamentally different than the studies taught in the Kurdish Region, she was required to start high school again.  She is currently pursuing her college education but is suffering from extreme post-traumatic stress.

Hey there, Reddit. We’re here to answer anything about Europa—the moon of Jupiter that probably has more liquid water than all the Earth’s oceans combined.

Europa also seems likely to have heat energy and nutrients. Combine those all together and you’re looking at a place that could be habitable for life at this very moment. It’s like having our own little  goldilocks-zone exoplanet in our cosmic backyard.

We are:

* Bill Nye, The Science Guy, and CEO of [The Planetary Society](http://planetary.org)
* Dr. Ellen Stofan, NASA’s Chief Scientist
* Dr. Robert Pappalardo, Europa Study Scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory
* Casey Dreier, Director of Advocacy for The Planetary Society

Why are we doing this? Fundamentally we all love Europa and the mysteries associated with it. What, if anything, can be found in the great oceans of Europa? How could NASA look for life? What would it mean to discover life or even to discover that there is no life there? These are compelling questions, and we’re talking about them today in a special event in D.C. We had such a strong response, we decided to talk about it on Reddit, too.

Some good Europa resources:

* [A cliffs notes version of why Europa is so intriguing, with lots of great animations, also from NatGeo](http://www.nationalgeographic.com/astrobiology/distant-oasis/)

* How big is Europa? Here is a [comparison of surface areas of bodies in the solar system from Randall Monroe at xkcd](http://xkcd.com/1389/large/)

##**FAQ**

####**What kind of line are you using for your main connection?**

We are using a 10gbps dedicated fiber line that is connected to a telecom fiber node. The fiber node connection service is scalable in increments of 100mbps. We are starting off with 1gbps and scaling up from there, as needed.

####**What equipment are you using?**

NetVanta 5660 Fiber Router

Linksys LGS124

2x AF24HD

2x APC Smart-UPS C 1000VA

4x Rocket 5AC Prism Gen2

4x AM-5AC21-60

NSM5 for customer antennas.


####**How much are you charging?**

Speed | Monthly Price
---|---
25mbps | $50
50mbps | $80
100mbps | $125

####**Are there data caps?**

No.

####**How many customers will you need to break even?**

24 households. That's at a 25/25/50 distribution for 100/50/25mbps plans.

####**Are you a real ISP?**

Yes. Our customers have public facing IP addresses with our fiber router acting as a gateway. Our company is a registered ISP in our state.

####**What will happen to you if someone illegally torrents on your service?**

Nothing will happen to us. The customer with the offending IP address will receive a written warning.

####**If there's a change, will the net neutrality change affect your business?**

No. We will not change our ISP business practice. We will continue to be net neutral. It will not affect our enterprise dedicated fiber line either.

####**Can I get your service?**

Our service is limited to the Liberty & Eden, UT area right now.

####**What was the hardest thing about setting up your business?**

Finding the nearest fiber node and setting up the fiber trunk line was by far the most difficult thing. The rest was research and network mapping.

####**What's your plan for expansion in the future?**

As of right now, we want to create the best internet service provider we can for our community. We have no plans of expanding further than our area in the near future.

####**Are you hiring?**

No. We are not looking for any employees at the moment. I am retired and my wife is a network engineer. If the project becomes overwhelming in the distant future, we might consider hiring someone.

####**What are you going to do if your ISP figures out what you're doing?**

They are well aware of what we are doing and it is included in our contract with them.",2017-11-23 12:06:56

He’s been writing for us in the last year. [All of his work can be found here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/jamal-khashoggi/), including his [final column](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/jamal-khashoggi-what-the-arab-world-needs-most-is-free-expression/2018/10/17/). He was living in Virginia after leaving Saudi Arabia because he feared for his safety. He had been planning to settle in Istanbul and marry his Turikish fiancée. He went to the Saudi Consulate to pick up wedding papers, and he was detained and killed there. His remains have not been found. 
 
[Karen Attiah](https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/karen-attiah/) is global opinions editor for The Washington Post and was Jamal’s editor as well. She joined us in 2014 as an editor for our foreign desk before moving to the opinions section as deputy digital editor. In 2016 she moved to heading up our global opinions section with reported commentary from around the world.
 
[Jason Rezaian](https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/jason-rezaian/) joined The Post in 2012 and has been writing for global opinions this year. Rezaian was previously our bureau chief in Tehran, Iran, where he lived from 2009 to 2016. He's originally from San Francisco and still roots for the Golden State Warriors and Oakland A's. He's been a huge Star Wars fan for as long as he can remember. He also loves burritos, good ramen, and cooking Thai curries. His memoir ""[Prisoner](https://www.amazon.com/Prisoner-Jason-Rezaian/dp/0062691570),"" about the 544 days he spent held hostage by the government of Iran, comes out in January 2019. 

Today they will be talking about Jamal’s work, his life, his columns, as well as press freedom issues around the world, a topic Karen and Jason are very familiar with. Due to the sensitive nature of the ongoing situation involving Jamal, we might not answer questions speculating about what might happen or has happened outside of the known facts, and thanks in advance for understanding.

I’m a law professor and longtime political activist who decided to run against Congresswoman Schultz due to her strong support of the TPP and her unwillingness to listen to her constituents about our concerns. The TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership) would have disastrous effects on our middle class while heavily benefitting the super-wealthy. There are many other ways that Congresswoman Schultz has failed her constituents, including her support of payday loan companies and her stance against medical marijuana. I am also a strong Bernie Sanders supporter, and not only have I endorsed him, I’m thrilled that he has endorsed me as well!

Our campaign has come a long way since I announced in January— we have raised over 2 million dollars, and like Bernie Sanders, it’s from small donors, not big corporations. Our average donation is just $17. Please help us raise more to defeat my opponent [here](https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/rtimcanova).

The primary is August m30th, but early voting starts in just a few short weeks— so wem need as many volunteers around the country calling and doing voter ID. This let’s us use our local resources to canvass people face-to-face. Please help us out by going [here] (http://www.timcanova.com/phonebank).

"My name's Christian Selig, I used to work at Apple and now build the Apollo Reddit app with over 1 million downloads. 100% of the app's proceeds today will be donated to the SPCA animal shelter, which has taken in a bunch of orphaned/abandoned kittens and is very strained on resources. 🐶🐱AMA!",29200,cfnfu8,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/cfnfu8/my_names_christian_selig_i_used_to_work_at_apple/,2348,1563667541.0,"Hey all,

Little backstory, my name's Christian Selig, I'm freshly 26 (today's my birthday actually!), and I build the [Apollo for Reddit](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id979274575) app.

In the summer of 2014 during my Computer Science degree I was lucky enough to intern at Apple as engineer on the Enterprise App Development team in Cupertino (long way from Eastern Canada), where I learned an absolute ton from some crazy smart people.

After returning I set out to build a Reddit app that felt like if Apple themselves was to design a Reddit app, something that really felt at home on iOS and used a lot of the skills I learned to create something super fast and lean, while also being powerful and just a lot of fun to use. After 2 years of development and betas working closely with a few thousand Redditors to help shape it into the perfect client, I released it in October 2017.

The reception was really amazing, and it's now almost at 1.5 million downloads. It's been my full-time job for about 4 years now.

**Today, 100% of the proceeds from the app will go to the SPCA Animal Shelter in Nova Scotia.** Apollo is free to download and has a Pro/Ultra version you can unlock, so if you get those today the proceeds will completely go to the animal shelter and helping the cats and dogs and bunnies and turtles.

**In addition I'll donate an extra $0.10 for every comment this thread gets by tomorrow. no spam tho plz**

Why right now? These warm months are dubbed [""kitten season""](https://spca.bc.ca/news/kitten-season/) because it's far and away the time when most cats have kittens. Shelters are overwhelmed with abandoned/orphaned kittens and their resources and food becomes very very tight. The shelter we're donating to is where [I adopted my two amazing cats from](https://imgur.com/a/Rr9Cbtv), and they're truly an amazing bunch who cares so much, so I really want to help them in this time that's really stressful for them. 

Last year we did the same thing [and raised $5,000 for them](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/95ezsl/so_apollo_made_508723_yesterday_yeah_no_joke_just/) and they were absolutely floored. I really want to try to do $10,000 this year!

AMA! I will attempt to answer every question.

**EDIT**: A bunch have asked what the app exactly is in more detail haha, so here's the gist:

Apollo's an app for browsing Reddit on your iOS device, similar to the official Reddit app. I worked at Apple for a little while and was using Alien Blue, and really wanted to build a Reddit app that felt like if Apple themselves decided to build a Reddit app, something that felt perfectly at home on iOS. No knock on the official app (it's well done by talented people), but it doesn't follow a lot of the iOS design guidelines and feels a little Android-y to me at times. It's kinda like a car, you might be perfectly happy with yours and wonder what's the point of another car, but you might drive in another car and just find it more fun and comfortable to use. On top of this Apollo has some really slick custom gestures, a Jump Bar for quickly bouncing between subreddits, color-coded comments for easy navigation, a really powerful media viewer and it was voted the best Reddit app for iOS by [The Sweet Setup](https://thesweetsetup.com/apps/the-best-reddit-app-for-ios/).

Oh and I'm still answering questions.

"I wrote a book about how Hulk Hogan sued Gawker, won $140M, and bankrupted a media empire...funded by billionaire Peter Thiel to get revenge (or justice). AMA",29129,845ou2,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/845ou2/i_wrote_a_book_about_how_hulk_hogan_sued_gawker/,2313,1520988790.0,"Hey reddit, my name is Ryan Holiday.

I’ve spent the last year and a half piecing together billionaire Peter Thiel’s decade long quest to destroy the media outlet Gawker. It was one of the most insane--and successful--secret plots in recent memory. I’ve been interested in the case since it began, but it wasn’t until I got a chance to interview both Peter Thiel, Gawker’s founder Nick Denton, Hulk Hogan, Charles Harder (the lawyer) et al that I felt I could tell the full story. The result is my newest book **[Conspiracy: Peter Thiel, Hulk Hogan, Gawker, and the Anatomy of Intrigue](https://www.amazon.com/Conspiracy-Ryan-Holiday/dp/0735217645/)**

When I started researching the 25,000 pages of legal documents and conducting interviews with all the key players, I learned a lot of the most interesting details of this conspiracy were left out of all previous coverage. Like the fact the secret weapon of the case was a 26 year old man known “Mr. A.” Or the various legal tactics employed by Peter’s team. Or Thiel ‘fanning the flames’ of #Gamergate. Sorry I'm getting carried away...

I wrote this story because beyond touching on many of our most urgent issues (privacy, media, the power of money), it is a timely reminder that things are rarely as they seem on the surface. Peter would tell me in one of our interviews people look down on conspiracies because we're so cynical we no longer believe in strong claims of human agency or the individual's ability to create change (for good or bad). It's a depressing thought. At the very least, this story is a reminder that that cynicism is premature...or at least naive. 

*[Conspiracy](https://www.amazon.com/Conspiracy-Ryan-Holiday/dp/0735217645/)*  is my eighth book. My past books include *The Obstacle Is The Way, Ego Is The Enemy, The Daily Stoic, Trust Me, I’m Lying*, and *Growth Hacker Marketing*. Outside writing I run a marketing agency, [Brass Check](http://www.brasscheck.net/), and tend to (way too many) animals on my ranch outside Austin.

We are the [WikiLeaks](https://wikileaks.org/) staff, including [Sarah Harrison](http://www.vogue.com/11122973/sarah-harrison-edward-snowden-wikileaks-nsa/). Over the last months we have published over 25,000 [emails from the DNC](https://wikileaks.org/dnc-emails/), over 30,000 [emails from Hillary Clinton](https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/), over 50,000 [emails from Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/) and many chapters of the secret controversial [Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA)](https://wikileaks.org/tisa/).

The Clinton campaign unsuccessfully tried to claim that our publications are inaccurate. WikiLeaks’ decade-long pristine record for authentication remains. [As Julian said](https://wikileaks.org/Assange-Statement-on-the-US-Election.html): ""Our key publications this round have even been proven through the [cryptographic signatures](https://www.wikileaks.org/DKIM-Verification.html) of the companies they passed through, such as Google. It is not every day you can mathematically prove that your publications are perfect but this day is one of them.""

We have been very excited to see all the great citizen journalism taking place [here at Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiLeaks/) on these publications, especially on the [DNC email archive](https://www.reddit.com/r/DNCleaks/) and the [Podesta emails](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5a3x7l/wikileaks_central_station_on_rthe_donald/?st=ivcib4ow&sh=895ef2e0).

Recently, the White House, in an effort to silence its most critical publisher during an election period, pressured for our editor Julian Assange's publications to be stopped. The government of Ecuador then issued a statement saying that it had ""temporarily"" [severed Mr. Assange's internet link over the US election](http://www.cancilleria.gob.ec/en/official-communique_2/). As of the 10th his internet connection has not been restored. There has been no explanation, which is concerning.

WikiLeaks has the necessary contingency plans in place to keep publishing. WikiLeaks staff, continue to monitor the situation closely.

1. Did you know, or how did you get to know that you went to school with the defacto heir of the northkorean State?

2. Was he a normal Pupil, or was there a lot of mystery about who he was? (Did he use his real name?)

3. What was the school like you attended? Where is it located in Ostermundigen?

4. Did you feel like he was a likeable person and did you develop any kind of friendship to him?

5. In hindsight, if you knew who he was at the moment, what would you like to have said to him, not said to him?

There were numerous AMA requests, so here I am, happy to oblige.

In this pilot project, a few select cities in Ontario were chosen, where people who met the criteria (namely, if you're single and live under $34,000/year or if you're a couple living under $48,000) you were eligible to receive a basic income that supplements your current income, up to $1400/month. It was a random lottery. I went to an information session and applied, and they randomly selected two control groups - one group to receive basic income payments, and another that wouldn't, but both groups would still be required to fill out surveys regarding their quality of life with or without UBI. I was selected to be in the control group that receives monthly payments. 

AMA!

EDIT: Holy shit, I did not expect this to blow up. Thank you everyone. Clearly this is a very important, and heated discussion, but one that's extremely relevant, and one I'm glad we're having. I'm happy to represent and advocate for UBI - I see how it's changed my life, and people should know about this. To the people calling me lazy, or a parasite, or wanting me to die... I hope you find happiness somewhere. For now though friends, it's past midnight in the magical land of Ontario, and I need to finish a project before going to bed. I will come back and answer more questions in the morning. Stay safe, friends!

EDIT 2: I am back, and here to answer more questions for a bit, but my day is full, and I didn't expect my inbox to die... first off, thanks for the gold!!! <3 Second, a lot of questions I'm getting are along the lines of, ""How do you morally justify being a lazy parasitic leech that's stealing money from taxpayers?"" - honestly, I don't see it that way at all. A lot of my earlier answers have been that I'm using the money to buy time to work and build my own career, why is this a bad thing? Are people who are sick and accessing Canada's free healthcare leeches and parasites stealing honest taxpayer money? Are people who send their children to publicly funded schools lazy entitled leeches? Also, as a clarification, the BI is supplementing my current income. I'm not sitting on my ass all day, I already work - so I'm not receiving the full $1400. I'm not even receiving $1000/month from this program. It's supplementing me to get up to a living wage. And giving me a chance to work and build my career so I won't have need for this program eventually. 

Okay, I hope that clarifies. I'll keep on answering questions. RIP my inbox.

As a child, I grew up constantly hearing of harrowing personal accounts from family friends who were carjacked and robbed at gun point. The government would run advertisements on television advising people to not stop for traffic lights at night unless absolutely necessary. The flats we lived in had 3 levels of security - a spiked metal fence for the complex, steel reinforced doors for the unit, and another layer of steel reinforced doors to go upstairs where the bedrooms were.

The straw that broke the camel's back was when one of our close family friends who was the founder of a Chinese-language newspaper was fatally shot in his own home during an intrusion.

My mother decided to take a leap of faith and bring me and my sister to the United States on an H-1B visa paying a meager wage. We were evicted from my aunt's house after 3 months, and another relative took us in until my mother could afford our own apartment.

9 years in the Marine Corps and an MBA later, I decided to tackle an issue that I am deeply passionate about and started a company that develops AI software to automatically identify gun threats. We are now raised over $1 million of venture funding and are working with schools in Chicago, New York, and Seattle.

[https://truepic.com/vroh7zfp](https://truepic.com/vroh7zfp)

I’ve wanted to do something like this for a while now and heard about this site from a bunch of people. Then my good friend, Alex Rockwell, asked me if I’d like to help him with his fundraiser campaign for his latest movie, Sweet Thing. We decided this would be a good time for me to reach out to my fans while getting a little extra noise going for his project, which stars his two talented kids alongside Will Patton and Karyn Parsons. For those of you who aren’t familiar, Alex is one of the most creative, hard-working independent filmmakers out there. We’ve worked together three times (In The Soup, 13 Moons, and Louis & Frank). Each one was a was lot of fun. He’s a pleasure to be around, and I always get excited when I hear that he’s got something in the works. I met his ex-wife, Jennifer Beals, in an acting class years ago, and I’ve been great friends with her and Alex since.

I’d tell you about Sweet Thing, but I think it’s best to let Alex do that himself. Just know that the film so far looks incredible, and they just need a bit more juice to get it fully out there. So check out the video and read about the film on their Kickstarter: [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1328225661/sweet-thing?](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1328225661/sweet-thing?)

I’m throwing in some rewards for the Kickstarter campaign, all of which you can find on their page, but include things like signed photos, custom voicemails, coffee hang outs, and more! Steve Buscemi, and Jennifer Beals are helping out too. Same, obviously, with Will and Karyn.

But anyway, I’m here for more than just promotion, I’m here to have fun with you all! Let’s get to it!

EDIT: Hey Reddit! I have to log off now, I only had about an hour to spare, and answering these questions took longer than I had expected. Apologies, there were some great comments I never got to.

"My son was legally stolen from me. I decided to take my living nightmare, and use it to fuel positive change for my community. Now I’m running for Congress in Texas’s 22nd congressional district. I’m Letitia Plummer. AMA. [XPost r/SandersForPresident]",26750,72t2e1,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/72t2e1/my_son_was_legally_stolen_from_me_i_decided_to/,1,1506555432.0,"#[Ask questions over here at /r/SandersForPresident!](https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/72si1e/my_son_was_legally_stolen_from_me_i_decided_to/?sort=new)

##[I’m Letitia Plummer, and I’m running for Texas’s 22nd congressional district seat.](http://imgur.com/yyT6bKc.jpg)

---

Three years ago, my ex-husband legally stole my infant son, Alex, from me. At a certain point, pregnancy can become risky for both a woman and a child, so we decided to have a child through a surrogate mother. Texas is a very surrogate-friendly state, so I felt safe going through this process.

Since my then-husband was a criminal defense attorney by trade, I left the legal papers to him. What I didn’t know was that for the intended parent to have any legal rights to a child, certain papers must be filed by certain deadlines. But, my then-husband didn’t file any of those papers for my parental rights. So even though my name was on the birth certificate of my child, I wasn’t his parent in the eyes of the law.

My husband knew this. But when we started the process of divorce, I had no idea. I found out through the mediation process. I remember my lawyer walking out of the room, and telling me, “Letitia, I don’t know how to say this to you, but there’s nothing you can do. You literally have to walk away, and you’ll never see him again.” That was pretty crazy, and pretty soul-crushing to me. The last time I saw Alex was when he was 2 months old.

So, I did the only thing I could think to do: change the law so this could never happen to another intended parent again. It started with me, writing down on a piece of paper what could have been different, so my then husband wouldn’t have been able to accomplish what he did. But, since I’m not a lawyer—I’m a dentist—I didn’t know how to put it in the right legal jargon. So I had a friend help me with that, and together, we took it to the Texas Family Law Foundation, who stood by my side to write legislation to protect the rights of intended parents for surrogate children in the event of a dissolution of marriage. And we got it passed.

---

##This is the reason I got into politics, activism, and advocacy. My nightmare empowered me, in a way. You don’t need to be a doctor or a lawyer, you just need to be a regular person who has gone through something in their life. We have all experienced injustice and pain, and we can all use that to fuel action to create a better community and country. The key is taking action in whatever you can, and find the avenues where action is possible.  

---

Now, my best avenue for action is running for Congress. So, I’m running to represent Texas’s 22nd congressional district. I will fight as hard as I can for my district as I will for my son, who I will likely never see until he is 18 years old. And there’s a lot I can do for my district, and a lot I’ve already done. Here’s one recent example:

Right after Harvey happened, I was sitting in my living room and having a bit of survivor's guilt, watching the devastation unfold all around us. I called around to nearby churches and shelters to see what they were missing—but they were all full. Nobody was accepting any more materials. And I remembered seeing on TV the stacks and stacks of clothing piled on the tables. It occurred to me—if your house is flooded and all your possessions destroyed, though you’re grateful, you realistically don’t have time or energy to go digging through those mounds. So nobody was taking a thing.

I thought, “let me create something that allows people to have their dignity back, and allows them to shop for clothes instead of dig.” So, we created the Harvey Relief Boutique in my Pearland office. We accepted donations of clothes, cleaning supplies, and water—things that people needed. A friend volunteered a gallery space for us to use. We created a store, put everything on hangers, and sorted it all by size. We didn’t charge for a single thing, but we gave them a dignified way to get the clothes they need in a safe space. In one week, we were able to give away over 1,200 items. I’m really proud of that.

After that, we moved all the remaining items back to my office, and then Hurricane Maria happened, which was catastrophic for the US Virgin Islands. One of my sorority sisters was from St. Croix, and I heard through the grapevine that she was packing a container to send to her country. So, we gave her the remaining items, and they all went to St. Croix—about 1,000 items in all. In two weeks, we supported two American communities—both my home and a community I’ve never known, and never visited, but one made up of my fellow Americans.

My point here is not to brag and boast. It’s just not as hard to make a difference as politicians make it out to be. So when you see things happening your world that are not quite right, that we want to change, you sit down and figure out how you can change it, and then you try to put things into play to change it.  And if we did that as an entire country, then we’d be in a whole different America right now. We wouldn’t be talking about uninsured people, we wouldn’t be caught off guard by four category 4 hurricanes, and we’d be dealing with climate change—we’d be doing something.  

---

###So please, Ask Me Anything. I’d appreciate the opportunity to get to know you better, and to let you get to know me. Here are some things I think you should ask about: I’m a small business owner—ask me about the vital role small businesses in injecting dollars into our communities or how absurdly difficult it is to get an SBA loan. Ask me about how I think we can get our country to be less discouraged and hopeless. Ask me about surrogacy law (I know it like the back of my hand now). Ask me about how I’ll support all families, including and especially alternative family models. Of course, you can ask me about anything else too.

I’m a father, a CEO, an Arizonan, and an author. When I was in college, two of my friends were shot and killed. That experience made me start to think about nonlethal weapons and whether they could be made a reality. Years later, I worked together with a [former NASA scientist](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jack-Cover) to develop the Taser weapon—and from that work came a company that today is listed on the [NASDAQ stock exchange](https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/aaxn).

In the show Star Trek, the [phaser](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Phaser) weapon could be set to stun—and after my friends were killed, I started to dive deeply into the technology of weapons that could incapacitate without killing. I’ve spent my entire life trying to achieve the goal of “obsoleting the bullet,” and I think we’re closer than ever to a world in which killing is a thing of the past.

I’ve spent decades on this topic, and because the issues are so sensitive and complex, I dove a little bit deeper these past few years and wrote a book about it, called [THE END OF KILLING](https://www.amazon.com/End-Killing-Technologies-Humanitys-Problem/dp/1989025536). I think we can end the acceptability of killing in my lifetime, and as crazy as that sounds, I think it’s the crazy ideas that fire up people’s ambitions and energies.

I grow diamonds. I make custom jewelry with these lab created diamonds. I hate diamond mining but love discussing functional uses of man-made diamonds.

I am a diamond geek, Stanford CS grad, and the accidental founder and CEO of [Ada Diamonds](https://www.adadiamonds.com/). We pressure cook carbon into diamond at a million PSI and 1500°C, and then we make [custom made\-to\-order jewelry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AsG0sy_INQ) with the diamonds. In addition, we supply diamond components to [Rolls\-Royce](https://www.press.rolls-roycemotorcars.com/rolls-royce-motor-cars-pressclub/article/detail/T0280450EN/adamas-collection-takes-rolls-royce-black-badge-further-into-the-darkness?language=en) and [Koenigsegg](https://www.koenigsegg.com/the-cars-of-salon-prive-2016/) (maker of the fastest production car on Earth @ 284mph)

Here's a [recent CNBC story](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/04/ada-diamonds-sells-lab-grown-diamonds-and-jewelers-cant-tell.html) about my startup and the lab diamond industry.

I believe laboratory grown diamonds are the future of fine jewelry, but also an important technology for a plethora of functional applications. There are medical, industrial, scientific, and computational (semiconducting and quantum!) applications of diamonds, and I'm happy to answer any questions about these emerging applications.

I also believe that [industrial diamond mining is now an unnecessary evil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIADCIVOZxQ), and seek to accelerate the cessation of large\-scale diamond mining. We are well past 'peak diamond' and each year diamond mining becomes [more carbon\-intensive and less sustainable](https://www.adadiamonds.com/synthetic-diamond-facts-and-misconceptions/is-diamond-mining-sustainable).

We're the Florida reporters who discovered that up to 800 bodies from Tampa's first African-American cemetery were missing. Ask us anything.,25575,ccb439,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ccb439/were_the_florida_reporters_who_discovered_that_up/,944,1562968297.0,"EDIT: Thank everyone for participating and asking questions. If you have more questions, email me at [pguzzo@tampabay.com](mailto:pguzzo@tampabay.com) and follow me @PGuzzoTimes for further reports on Zion Cemetery.

&#x200B;

We are Tampa Bay Times reporter Paul Guzzo and photographer James Borchuck.

We spent nine months seeking answers about [Tampa’s first African-American burial ground](https://www.tampabay.com/florida/2019/06/23/nearly-400-people-buried-in-tampa-are-missing-what-happened-to-zion-cemetery/) – Zion Cemetery. How was it erased from this city’s history? And what happened to those once interred there?

Between 1913 and 1920, [382 people were buried in Zion](http://www.tampabay.com/florida/2019/06/23/all-382-death-certificates-from-tampas-forgotten-zion-cemetery/), according to our research.

A cemetery historian claims he found [747 death certificates](https://www.tampabay.com/tampa/zion-cemeterys-population-may-be-far-more-than-previously-thought-20190624/) for Zion.

Travel to Zion now and you'll see restaurant trucks and apartments. In December 1923, the Tampa Times called Zion one of the city's ""most prominent and greatly used burial places."" That didn't stop developers.  [In November 1951](http://www.tampabay.com/florida/2019/06/23/key-dates-in-the-history-of-tampas-forgotten-zion-cemetery/), as construction was underway on the Robles Park housing project, crews unearthed three caskets from Zion, but there was no further search of the property for more remains. After that, Zion was never publicly discussed again.

During our search, we pored over [tens of thousands of records](http://www.tampabay.com/florida/2019/06/23/telling-the-story-of-tampas-forgotten-zion-cemetery/) dating back over a century. We still can't find the bodies.

Since our initial article was published, the city has partnered with the University of South Florida and the two owners of the former Zion land – the Tampa Housing Authority and Richard Gonzmart – to find out if more graves are there. That search will include ground penetrating radar.

[Two state senators](https://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/state-lawmakers-move-to-identify-preserve-forgotten-african-american-burial-sites-20190701/) have also announced they will draft a bill to find and protect African American cemeteries throughout Florida.

The questions I would like to ask him:

**Edit:** I realised that some questions were way out of place, therefore I replaced/edited some of them. There's a fine line between being nice and inappropriate.

1. If you could star in a remake of a popular movie, which one would you choose?

2. What are your goals in life at the moment and how are you thinking of accomplishing them?

3. How do you feel about working together with Danny Boyle and the set of actors on the upcoming FX series ""Trust""?

4. What is your favourite thing to do in your spare time?

5. If you had to chose only one movie to watch for the rest of your life, which one would it be?

I don't think Brendan has any official social media accounts so I think the only way to reach him is to contact his agencies, or of course if someone who sees this knows him and tells him about it. 

His agencies:

[Brillstein Entertainment](http://www.bepmedia.com/) | [Gersh](http://gershproduction.com/contact/)

As he seems to be having a rough time at the moment ([sad interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDYz4C5mxjs&t=915s), [Article about his annual alimony payments of 900,000$](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2279244/Broke-Brendan-Fraser-fights-reduce-alimony-child-support-payments-ex-wife.html) for anyone interested), he is not the easiest man to reach. But if someone out there with the power to convince him to do this AMA, would do so, I believe he wouldn't regret it. Let's show this man that we haven't forgotten about him and that we won't let him fade away! ",2017-06-03 06:04:36

After I became a citizen I was able to work on engineering projects including the Titan Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Launcher. As a strong anti-Communist I was proud to have the opportunity to work in the defense industry. Later I started an engineering company with my brother without any money and 48 years later the company is still going strong. In my book I also discuss my observations about how Soviet propaganda ensnared a generation of American intellectuals to becoming sympathetic to the cause of Communism.

Hope some of you found this an interesting glimpse into our isolated life here. And thanks to everyone who donated.. every little bit counts and we've been blown away by the generosity! (Btw, Total Win X usage here... 17gb!)

   
*^Edit:* ^Just ^a ^mass ^edit ^notice. ^This ^morning, ^now ^that ^my ^brain ^isn't ^fried.. ^I've ^gone ^thru ^a ^bunch ^of ^my ^comments ^to ^edit ^for ^spelling/grammar ^and ^also ^to ^add ^some ^information ^if ^I ^didn't ^fully ^answer
***
   
So.. I'm the guy that **[ranted about Windows 10 updates secretly downloading](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/4mcdon/i_live_in_the_central_african_bush_we_pay_for/)** on our slow, expensive, satellite connection. I was just upset, and venting. However, since there were several requests for an AMA, and we are trying to fundraise after our ultralight airplane crashed (album below), we decided it could be cool to try.   
   
To be honest, I have a good deal of experience as a bush pilot & IT guy in East Africa, as well as living in Antarctica and many other cool places.. but the staff here can speak with more experience about Anti-Poaching/wildlife protection and the creation of this project. So, if you guys are interested in this..  I'll do the typing, and they'll field your questions.   
   
***   
   
***About Us***:    
We are a team of local Central African + foreign expat staff in the Chinko Reserve (bordering Congo & South Sudan) trying to save wildlife from the militarized rebel poachers. We train and deploy rangers to hunt down these smugglers who have killed the majority of game wildlife and attack the local villages. Using aircraft, we support the rangers from above. Though, with the recent accident, along with the constant threat of armed poachers and rebel groups like Kony's LRA child army.. we are up against it!!   
   
Our founder first conceived the project in 2012 while he was falsely imprisoned for a massacre he discovered and tried to report! (Link below) In the last 30 years, poaching has driven the elephant population from 60,000 down to only a couple 100! However, In a very short time, Chinko has cleared a 3,000 sq/km ""core protection zone"" of all activity, & wildlife have seen significant rises. Now, we are trying to expand further into the reserve, which at 17,600 sq/km is almost as big as Kruger national park, and virtually untouched!  
   
   
***Fundraising***  
With the loss of our ULM, we started this campaign in the hopes to quickly get our operation back up to 100% . The few expats here have spent the majority of the last years in the bush & never tried a crowdfunding medium. I, while NOT a professional PR guy for this organization, have been an avid redditor for years. So I convinced the boss that this could be a possible venue for fundraising if people are interested. (Included proof below).  
   
If you *are* interested, check out our campaign here: **[Indiegogo's Generosity Site](https://igg.me/at/y2mhLo7F5RY)**.

Two years ago I was working a typical corporate job in Cincinnati, Ohio. This was my “dream” job after college, but after a few years there, I realized I hated it. I was too chicken to quit without having a “Plan B”, so I spent my lunch hour writing lists of what I could do next. I wrote about how I could be more optimistic about my current job. I wrote lists of what I enjoyed doing. Skills I wanted to learn. What to do next. One day, I wrote a list about “10 businesses I could start in a day”. I showed the list to my boyfriend that night at dinner, and he liked one of the ideas. We started working on it as soon as we cleared the dishes.

We each took $1,000 from our savings to start the business. For the next three months, we worked on our business whenever we weren’t at our corporate jobs. Within weeks, I realized I had been naïve, and that there was an enormous sacrifice to starting a business. I stopped volunteering. I lost touch with a lot of friends. I stopped working out. I gained weight. My boyfriend and I fought a lot about the business and I questioned whether what we were doing was worth it.

Two years ago today, we took our website live. Since then, we’ve had plenty of highs and lows. We've both quit our corporate jobs, moved from Ohio to New Jersey, hired people, fired people, and made a ton of mistakes. But we’ve also managed to grow our business and grow as people. We’re proud to provide a living for several employees, and send our customers a product that they love.

You might have heard about me because I’ve been challenged by reporters to make lots of predictions.  For example, Newsweek challenged me to predict the Oscars (link) and I was 76% accurate, which beat the vast majority of professional movie critics.  

TechRepublic challenged me to predict the Kentucky Derby (http://www.techrepublic.com/article/swarm-ai-predicts-the-2016-kentucky-derby/) and I delivered a pick of the first four horses, in order, winning the Superfecta at 540 to 1 odds.  

No, I’m not psychic.  I’m a Swarm Intelligence that links together lots of people into a real-time system – a brain of brains – that consistently outperforms the individuals who make me up.  Read more about me here: http://unanimous.ai/what-is-si/

In today’s AMA, ask me anything about Politics. With all of the public focus on the US Presidential election, this is a perfect topic to ponder. My developers can also answer any questions about how I work, if you have of them.

**My Proof: http://unu.ai/ask-unu-anything/ Also here is proof of my Kentucky Derby superfecta picks: http://unu.ai/unu-superfecta-11k/ & http://unu.ai/press/

**UPDATE 5:15 PM ET** From the Devs: Wow, guys. This was amazing. Your questions were fantastic, and we had a blast. UNU is no longer taking **new** questions. But we are in the process of transcribing his answers. We will also continue to answer your questions for us.

**UPDATE 5:30PM ET** Holy crap guys. Just realized we are #3 on the front page. Thank you all! **Shameless plug**: Hope you'll come check out UNU yourselves at http://unu.ai. It is open to the public. Or feel free to head over to r/UNU and ask more questions there.",2016-06-02 08:34:53

So, on to business...here's the copypasta.

[YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/donttouchmycoffee/)
Here's some basics to get you started:


* Dollar for dollar, a bagged vacuum, when compared to a bagless, will almost always:

1) Perform better (Actual quality of cleaning).

2) Be in service for much longer.

3) Cost less to repair and maintain (Often including consumables).

4) Filter your air better.

Virtually every vacuum professional in the business chooses a bagged vacuum for their homes, because we know what quality is.
Things you should do to maintain your vac, regularly:

1) Clear your brush roller/agitator of hair and fibers. Clear the bearing caps as well, if possible. (monthly)

2) Change your belts before they break. This is important to maintain proper tension against the agitator. (~ yearly for ""stretch"" belts)

3) Never use soap when washing any parts of your vacuum, including the outer bag, duct system, agitator, filters, etc. Soap attracts dirt, and is difficult to rinse away thoroughly.

* Types of vacs:

1) Generally, canister vacs are quieter and more versatile than uprights are. They offer better filtration, long lifespans, and ease of use. They handle bare floors best, and work with rugs and carpets, as well.

2) Upright vacuums are used mostly for homes that are entirely carpeted. Many have very powerful motors, great accessories, and are available in a couple of different motor styles. Nothing cleans shag carpeting like the right upright.

3) Bagless vacs are available in a few different styles. They rely on filters and a variety of aerodynamic methods to separate the dirt from the air. In general, these machines do not clean or filter as well as bagged vacuums. They suffer from a loss of suction, and tend to clog repeatedly, if the filters are not cleaned or replaced often.

4) Bagged vacuums use a disposable bag to collect debris, which acts as your primary filter, before the air reaches the motor, and is replaced when you fill it. Because this first filter is changed, regularly, bagged vacuums tend to provide stronger, more consistent suction.

My last, best piece of advice is to approach a vacuum, like any appliance; Budget for the best one you can get. Buy one with idea you will maintain it, and use it for many years. And, for the love of Dog, do not buy from late-night infomercials or door-to-door salesmen! Stay out of the big-box stores, and visit your local professional who actually knows what they're talking about.",2019-01-08 07:07:29

IAmAn Air Traffic Controller. The FAA will be hiring more controllers next month. This is a 6 figure job that does not require a college degree. AMA.,24503,8kwxk3,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/8kwxk3/iaman_air_traffic_controller_the_faa_will_be/,4319,1526892326.0,"************ UPDATE October 2 ************

For those of you still waiting for an email, it looks like another batch is going out today. 

********** UPDATE September 25 ***********

It looks like the AT-SA email blasts are going out today. Check your inbox for an email from PsiOnline with instructions on setting up an account and scheduling your test date.

*********** UPDATE September 5 ***********

Nothing new to provide, just wanted to check in with everybody. So far the only emails that I have heard of going out are rejection letters. I believe the ATO is still processing applicants from the N90 bid that was posted just before the general announcement that most of you applied to. Just keep checking those emails for AT-SA information, and I’ll update here as soon as I hear of any being received.

************* UPDATE August 7 ************

I’m getting a lot of questions from people asking about the delay. I know this process is most likely unlike any other hiring process you have experienced. This will take a while. The standard delay between bid closure and AT-SA emails has been 1-2 months. The delay from application to receiving a class date for the academy can easily take a year longer. Obviously things could go quicker than that, but be prepared to do a lot of waiting. There isn’t much else for me to update as of now, but I will continue to update this post as the process moves along, as well as answer any DMs. 

************** UPDATE July 30 *************

The bid has closed. The next step will be waiting for the AT-SA email, which could take up to a couple months. In the meantime, [HERE](https://pointsixtyfive.com/xenforo/threads/atsa-compilation.545/) is a comprehensive guide detailing what to expect on the AT-SA. Huge props to those who contributed to it over on pointsixtyfive.com. 

************** UPDATE July 29 *************

The bid will be closing tonight at midnight EST.

********* UPDATE July 27 00:01 EST *********

[The bid is posted!](https://www.usajobs.gov/GetJob/ViewDetails/506307400) 

************** UPDATE July 26 *************

The day is finally here. The bid will open up at 12:01 EST tonight. Fingers crossed that the site doesn’t crash. 

************** UPDATE July 24 *************

*EDIT 1:55 PM CST*

The July 27 hiring date is confirmed. From the National Air Traffic Controllers Association:

“The #FAA is accepting applications nationwide beginning July 27 from people interested in becoming air traffic controllers. When the application link is available, NATCA will share it on social media &amp; member communications.

Applicants must be U.S. citizens, speak English clearly, and be no older than 30 years of age (with limited exceptions). They must have a combination of three years of education and/or work experience. They are also required to pass a medical examination, security investigation, and FAA air traffic pre-employment tests. Applicants must be willing to work anywhere in the U.S. Agency staffing needs will determine facility assignment.

Accepted applicants will be trained at the FAA Academy in Oklahoma City. Active duty military members must provide documentation certifying that they expect to be discharged or released from active duty under honorable conditions no later than 120 days after the date the documentation is signed.

Visit www.usajobs.gov to start building your application and www.faa.gov/Jobs for more information.”

*END EDIT*


The July 27 opening date seems to be as set in stone as can be. Supposedly the FAA is shooting for a rough cap of 5,500 applicants, however that number could change. They plan on giving a 24 hour advance notice to CLOSING the bid. If you’re profile and application isn’t already as complete as you can make it, I suggest getting it together within the next 2 days. 

************** UPDATE July 23 *************

Coming through in the clutch once again, u/someguyathq has said that the post date has been pushed to July 27 and the FAA will provide a 24 hour notice prior to the bid going live. [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/ATC/comments/8tm3ed/comment/e2wor00?st=JJZ3BI9N&amp;sh=781facd8) to his comment.

************** UPDATE July 21 *************

I have been waiting to post another update until I had some concrete information, but at this point that is hard to come by. The latest information is that the FAA wants to try to open the bid on July 26 but is still waiting for the all clear from the Department of Transportation. It is not yet known if they plan on capping the number of applications they accept, so plan on first come first serve for the worst case scenario. As always, I will answer any questions and continue to update this thread. 

************** UPDATE July 12 *************

*EDIT 5:03 PM CST*

Another user who claims to work at HQ and has given solid information up to this point says that the bid will open the week of July 23. There will be no BQ and the bid will only stay open until they receive the maximum number of applications, which the user says will be around 5-6 thousand. [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/ATC/comments/8tm3ed/comment/e22ivd8?st=JJJ3NAK6&amp;sh=602624c2) to his post. 

*END EDIT*

As you have probably discerned by now, the bid will not be opening this week. The Department of Transportation was supposed to give the all clear this week, but as if this update they have yet to do so. We’re hoping that it will be posted by the end of this month, but as always nothing is confirmed. Unfortunately this delay is going to be just the first of many long waiting periods as you progress through the hiring process. I will continue to update this post with new information as it comes in, as well as respond to all of the DMs I receive. 

************** UPDATE July 6 **************

There is a possibility of the bid opening next week minus the Biographical Questionnaire. While this information is unconfirmed, it is believed by people close to the source to be accurate. Of course this could change (as you should be used to by now), but I wanted to give you all an update going into the weekend. Continue to follow this thread and USA Jobs for the most up to date information as I get it.

************** UPDATE June 29 *************

The June 27th public hiring announcement has been delayed while the FAA assesses how it will handle the hiring process moving forward. The administration is facing ongoing litigation regarding the Biographical Questionnaire (BQ) portion of the application. There is substantial pressure from the White House, Congress, and the media for the FAA to eliminate the BQ while developing a filtering method that is more effective and equitable for all. There is hope that this can be resolved within a few weeks; however, it could take longer. I will continue to keep this post updated with new information as soon as it is available. 

************** UPDATE June 27 *************

[The FAA has delayed the June 27 public announcement.](https://www.faa.gov/jobs/) I know all of you have been waiting for this day, and I will update this post as soon as I receive some new information.

************** UPDATE June 20 *************

There is currently a job posting for new hire ATC Trainees on USA Jobs. This bid will last through June 26. The FAA will use this bid to fill positions at New York TRACON (N90) in Westbury, New York.  *** This is ONLY OPEN to those who live within 50 statute miles of N90. ***

If you meet this criteria and wanted to stay in the NY area, you can apply to this bid. Understand, however, that you will be going to THE busiest airspace in the world. The reason the FAA is offering this direct bid is because the staffing is critical at this facility. This is due to an extremely high washout/burnout rate which is also causing mandatory 6 day work weeks.

From June 27 through July 2 the FAA will post the vacancy announcement open to ALL U.S. citizens for ALL locations, which is what this thread has been preparing you for. 

NOTES:
USAJobs now requires applicants to create a new account through login.gov to sign in to USAJobs before they can begin the electronic application. 

************** UPDATE June 7 **************

The open source bid will be open for applications from JUNE 27 to JULY 2. Pool 2 is for the General Public applicants (you). Once again, you will be applying for the “Air Traffic Control Specialist Trainee” position under series 2152. Once again, it is HIGHLY recommended that you use the resume builder on USA Jobs rather than upload a resume with a different format.

[Information about the job and requirements](https://www.faa.gov/jobs/career_fields/aviation_careers/) 

————————————————————————

To be eligible to apply in the upcoming hiring panel, you must be a US citizen, be under 31 years old, and have either 3 years of full time work experience, a bachelor’s degree, or a combination of both full time work experience and college credits.

Part of your application will be to take a Biographical Questionnaire. This is similar to personality tests you can find online. Once you’ve completed the application, you’ll have to wait a couple months to find out if you passed the BQ. If you didn’t, you’ll have to try again next time they open a hiring bid, which will most likely be next year. If you do pass, you will have to wait another 2-4 months to be scheduled to take the AT-SA. This is an 8 hour aptitude exam that you must pass to continue through the process. If you pass the AT-SA, you will get a Tentative Offer Letter around 2 months after that will include instructions on getting your medical completed, as well as setting up an appointment for a psychological evaluation. Once you’ve done that and your background check is completed, you’ll once again have to wait a few months to find out a class date for the FAA Academy in Oklahoma City. We joke around that the FAA’s motto is “Hurry up and wait”, and it’s pretty much spot on. 

You will spend 3-4 months at the academy getting your initial training, the time difference being based on whether you were hired for Terminal (airport towers) or En Route (radar centers). At the end of your training you will take several examinations, which consist of you running simulated air traffic. If you fail, you lose your job. If you pass, you’ll get a list of facilities to choose from that can be anywhere in the country. YOU MUST BE WILLING TO RELOCATE. Once at your facility, you will continue your training on real traffic at your facility. This can take anywhere from 1-3 years, depending on your skill and the facility. 

I can’t stress enough how amazing this job is. You will make anywhere from $70,000 - $180,000 per year, depending on your facility. You will have a pension that will pay you around 40% of your highest 3 year gross pay average for the rest of your life, and a 401k that matches 5% (1 for 1 the first 3%, 1/2 for 1 for the other 2%). Mandatory retirement is at 56, but you can retire at 50 with full benefits. You will earn good vacation time, as well as 13 sick days per year. On any given 8 hour shift you will have anywhere from 2-4 hours of break time. The worst part about the schedule is the rotating shift work, but it’s not that bad. 

Any other questions, please don’t hesitate to ask here or PM me. I would love to help as many people get into this field as possible. Most people have no idea that this is even a thing. ",2018-05-21 16:45:26

I'm Colin Cantwell. Please be patient with me as I am 84 and this is my first time on Reddit.  You may not have heard about me, as I like to keep out of the limelight, but I'm sure you've seen projects I've worked on. I'm looking forward to getting to know you and answering your questions!

**A short list of my most favorite experiences are:**
* Being accepted to Frank Lloyd Wright's architectural school
* Working with NASA to inform the public on the first unmanned space flights
* Being Walter Cronkite's “Hal 9000” NASA connection during live broadcast of the first moon landing
* Inventing the first real color monitor for Hewlett Packard
* Writing my first book CoreFires - a labor of love 20 years in the making

**I've worked on the following movies & shows:**
* **Lead star ship designer for Star Wars** - I drew the original designs for the X-Wing, A-Wing, Star Destroyer, TIE Fighter, & Rebel cruisers. I was also the one who designed and sculpted the Death Star and gave it it's trench
* **2001, A Space Odyssey** - I worked closely with Stanley Kubrick and persuaded him not to start the movie with a 20 minute conference table discussion
* **Buck Rogers in the 25th Century**
* **Close Encounters of a Third Kind**
* **War Games**

I have a deep interest in science - especially quantum physics and space travel. I could not have picked a better time to have been born. So much has happened so quickly! Our dreams of space flight are maturing and I believe one day soon we’ll be exploring the next waiting wonders of our galaxy.

**Two short anecdotes to get us started -**
When I was a boy, I was diagnosed with TB as well as partial retinal detachment. The cure was to confine me to a dark room with a heavy vest across my chest to prevent coughing fits. I spent nearly TWO YEARS of my childhood immobilized in this dark room. Suffice to say, nothing else could slow me down after that!

George Lucas gave me the project of designing a “Death Star”. I didn't originally plan for the Death Star to have a trench, but when I was working with the mold, I noticed the two halves had shrunk at the point where they met across the middle. It would have taken a week of work just to fill and sand and re-fill this depression. So, to save me the labor, I went to George and suggested a trench. He liked the idea so much that it became one of the most iconic moments in the film!

----
My latest project is a book series called *CoreFires*. I've made it available for free in the hopes that readers will find in it a sense of wonder and excitement. It's space science fiction of course! You can read the description [here](http://colincantwell.com/books2/)

You can see my original Pre-Star Wars artwork [here](https://colincantwell2.threadless.com)
My book is available for free [here](http://colin-cantwell.com/contest.html)
This also enters you in a contest for a free signed print of my original Pre-Star Wars star ship designs.
You can also get *CoreFires* for free on Amazon [here](https://www.amazon.com/CoreFires-DEATH-Designer-Colin-Cantwell-ebook/dp/B01LYL9IH8/) for the next 3 days

I hope that's enough to get us started. AMA!

My name is Andrew & I have been a janitor since I was 14 years old. I am now 32. Ask me anything.,24460,b38fb4,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/b38fb4/my_name_is_andrew_i_have_been_a_janitor_since_i/,2987,1553090898.0,"[IMG](https://imgur.com/gallery/N3EUpZE)

Hello Reddit, my name is Andrew. For the past 18 years I have been a janitor. I initially started working for my parents who had a cleaning company. When the time came, I took over the family business. I have had other jobs on the side besides this. I worked as a medical transporter, worked in a bowling alley. Construction, I even had a few years as a YouTuber, but I have never quit this job. 
I know there are a lot of negative connotations with this profession, & I hope that with this AMA I will be able to answer some questions about a job some people say they would never do.",2019-03-20 22:08:18

I’d been offered the job of a lifetime: filming a colony of 8,000 emperor penguins in Antarctica as part of a small team working on David Attenborough’s new BBC series Dynasties. 

The area we filmed in was so isolated, we were locked in for 11 months, with no way for people to get in, or out. The time away from home meant I even missed the birth of my son. Aside from our team of three, the closest other human was on another base hundreds of miles away.

I am severely disabled and bedridden at only 21. I have a myriad of different health problems caused by a traumatic brain injury. I live my life from this bed.

Edit: I’m adding a screenshot of my diagnoses listed on my mychart from Cleveland Clinic. These are the only ones that fit in the [screenshot](https://imgur.com/gallery/ZX7wcK4). Apparently I have to prove it to some people by showing them my medical records. 

[Day of pills](https://imgur.com/gallery/E4oFDhb), next to pill bottle for size

[Pill sorters](https://imgur.com/gallery/GjK00U0) 

[Some of my pill bottles](https://imgur.com/gallery/yo82OUe). My boyfriend has the rest. He sorts my pills. 


I used to be the epitome of health and was an athlete living my dreams, until my [accident](https://imgur.com/gallery/SxWEHhA) in 2014, at the age of 17.

After months of rehab, I recovered almost fully. But, I was left with progressing disabilities, which we were unaware of at the time. Over the years, I’ve gotten sicker and sicker. I’ve had many [hospital stays](https://imgur.com/gallery/dgIaVzO). I became completely bedridden about 8 months ago. ([another hospital picture](https://imgur.com/gallery/dgIaVzO))

My whole world consists of this room and doctor appointments. I spend most of the day alone, as my boyfriend works full-time. It’s incredibly boring and lonely. He is the only person I have interaction with. Some days, I just want to rip my hair out and scream. Thankfully, I spend most of the time asleep. My fatigue is so severe that I sleep ~16-20 hours a day. I’m going to be receiving a service dog to help me regain my life, which I’m beyond excited about, but it’ll probably be 2-3 years before I manage to raise all the funds. I’m looking forward to the day I can walk again with their aid (among the many other tasks the dog will do to help me).

I suffer from Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, POTS, Fibromyalgia, Gastroparesis, and cervical spondylosis. We are currently exploring the possibility of simple-partial seizures. 

My occipital nerves are damaged, causing occipital neuralgia. It’s less common sister syndrome to trigeminal neuralgia. They are often considered the most painful condition known, and dubbed “suicide disease”, as 1/4 people with them commit suicide. I am being treated with gabapentin and baclofen, but my doctors will not allow me and further pain relief. I admit that I’d be one of the 1/4 if my family didn’t place me on “suicide watch” some days. If I could leave this bed and drive, I’d most likely self-medicate with heroin to make the pain stop on my pain flare days. I have no desire to become a drug addict, and I’m very glad I’ve never had the chance. 

I also have PTSD from a severely abusive relationship. This included rape (in any way imaginable), torture, and other horrible things. I may answer questions about that as well, but most of it is blocked. 

Ask me anything. Don’t hold back, I’m bored!! 



Edit: **My accident**
Many people want to know about my accident. I was kicked under the jaw by a horse, thrown back ten feet, and hit the back of my head on a split rail fence. I was seizing before I hit the ground. Paramedics spent half an hour trying to stabilize me (I kept seizing) before they could take me in. The fire chief left his car at the scene so he could come in the ambulance to help the paramedics. I was dying. They told everybody that, so that everyone were aware. They said that if I lived, I’d be comatose. There was a very slim chance of me waking up, but they said I’d be severely brain damaged. Yes, I had a helmet on. It saved my life. 

I woke up later in the ICU. I didn’t have neurosurgery, like they expected. I had pretty good cognitive function. My only cognitive issues now are caused by brain fog from my other conditions. 

I want to make it very clear that I’m not asking for money. I don’t HAVE to raise a dime. They can do all the fundraising for me. It will just take much longer. 

Edit: someone keeps posting “Bullsh*t” in the comments and linking an article written about me a year after the accident. I would just like to point out that it’s not BS, because... well, it’s me, lmao. Here is further proof. This is my [facebook](https://m.facebook.com/abby.bedwell?ref=bookmarks). Look at what I posted. Same name as the girl in the article, because that’s be me. 

Edit: wow ok this blew up while I was asleep. I’m trying to answer as many questions and PMs as I can. 

Thank you so much for your support, everyone. 

Edit: no, I’m not paralyzed. I do have the ability to stand momentarily and some days can even walk up to ten feet before collapsing. I didn’t think this information magically made my illnesses fake, but I guess it does to the internet. The more you learn. I post my ups on social media, because people didn’t like when I posted my downs. I only linked my facebook to prove that my name is the same name from the article people were using to say I stole it from her (me). My reddit history should be more to your satisfaction if you want to see comments about being disabled. 

Yes, I had a service dog. He was too small for mobility. He was for PTSD. He retired in 2016. 

Edit: I’d like to clarify that the person naming all my drugs is wrong. I’m not sure why they tried to name them from a picture. I’m getting tired of trying to prove to people that I’m not spinning an elaborate lie spanning over four years, so I’m gonna stop answering questions. Thank you so much, everybody! Well, those of you who didn’t constantly try to “prove me wrong”.",2019-01-19 05:24:16
I'm a 23 year old male who just finished chemo for a rare form of breast cancer AMA!,24245,7riyit,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/7riyit/im_a_23_year_old_male_who_just_finished_chemo_for/,1115,1516403777.0,"Hello! I found a lump in my right breast when I was 14 and didn't think anything of it. I googled and just blew it off as puberty or something and ignored it. As I got older it grew and eventually was big enough that I could constantly feel it. I went to a urgent care place since I didn't have a primary care physician and they referred me to a breast health center. There they did an ultrasound and did a mammogram. After that they scheduled me for a biopsy in January of 2017.

The biopsy results came back as benign so I figured since I just started a new job I'll wait to get some time off and get it removed. I went to another surgeon (the other one left town and referred me to the new one) in August of 2017 when I had the time and money to get it taken out. On August 17th the doctor told me it was malignant and it was extremely rare for it to have been cancer, especially since I had the lump for so long. He set me up with an oncologist and I had scans and a mastectomy, because the first surgery was just removing the lump not the entire breast. The oncologist told me he didn't know if chemo would be beneficial after the mastectomy since there weren't many cases of it. We decided to go with 4 cycles of chemo to hopefully get rid of any cancer cells left behind after the surgeries.

I started chemo November 9th 2017 and it just ended on January 11th 2018. Now I go back to the oncologist Monday to see what we are doing next!

The TPP is a massive global deal between 12 countries, which was negotiated for years in complete secrecy, with hundreds of corporate advisors helping draft the text while journalists and the public were locked out. The text has been finalized, but it can’t become law unless it’s approved by U.S. Congress, where it faces an uphill battle due to swelling opposition from across the political spectrum. The TPP is branded as a “trade” deal, but its more than 6,000 pages contain a wide range of policies that have nothing to do with trade, but pose a serious threat to good jobs and working conditions, Internet freedom and innovation, environmental standards, access to medicine, food safety, national sovereignty, and freedom of expression.

Over a year after I separated from my husband, he finally gave up trying to get me back and decided to hire someone to kill me instead. Luckily, the police were notified and an elaborate sting was set up to catch him, which included them pretty much faking my murder. Two days ago, my ex husband received a ten year sentence for conspiracy to commit murder.

If this looks familiar, I did do an AMA on this a while back, but was advised to take it down since the case wasn't completely settled at the time (posting it at the time was probably pretty stupid of me). Please forgive me if my formatting isn't perfect, I'm usually more of a lurker on Reddit.

This has gotten so much bigger than I ever expected. Please be patient with me, I am trying to answer as many questions as possible, and do so as coherently as possible.

EDIT: I see a lot of the same questions being asked in a lot of different places, and I'm really sorry that I haven't explained everything in a way that satisfies everyone. Here are the answers to some of the most repeated questions, for those of you who are getting a bit irate with my ineptitude in the comments:

1. No, I do not know anyone named Lambesis.
2. Yes, the children are his, they know only a few basic details about what happened, and they are handling it well, all things considered.
3. He tried to find a hitman by asking his friends, and one of them tipped off the police.
4. No, I was not trying to take any of his money, or even half of it, in the divorce. I only wanted him to leave me alone. 
5. The warning signs that made me leave in the first place are mostly included among this [list](http://www.newhopeforwomen.org/abuser-tricks)

EDIT 2: I just want to thank everyone for reading this and commenting. I've learned that my situation is nowhere near unheard of. Knowing that there are so many others out there who have been through similar things helps a lot. Also, I know a lot of you aren't completely satisfied with the answers that I could give, and I'm sorry that I don't know every detail, or if some details are a little too personal to discuss.

I’ve been an actress and singer in many other productions as well! I played what Dr. Martin Luther King called, “the first non-stereotypical role portrayed by a black woman in television history."" Due to my unexpected position as a role model on television for minorities in space, I was asked by NASA to help in a highly effective campaign to recruit minority and female personnel for the space agency. People I recruited include Sally Ride, the first woman in space, Mae Jemison, the first African American woman in space, and Charles Bolden, the current NASA administrator. 

(Her friend, Gil, is here actually writing up Nichelle's responses).

Today, I’m blessed to be able to spend so much time travelling the country (and the world!)  at comic cons and Star Trek conventions. I’ve probably met many of you in my travels. 

I’m doing something very exciting online. I’m one of the founding celebrities on a new website called [StarPower](https://www.starpower.co/star/nichellenichols), where stars raise funds for the causes we care about while building closer, long-lasting relationships with our fans. I’m giving away some of my original Star Trek memorabilia, tickets to upcoming events, and doing some exclusive one-on-ones with fans. I even started hosting my own mini-AMA before someone told me I should do it here! What sets StarPower apart from other sites is that it’s a monthly subscription rather than a flash-in-the pan. I know from working with non profits in the past that a constant, reliable revenue source is the dream compared to the booms and busts of traditional fundraising. I’m supporting the [Technology Access Foundation](http://techaccess.org/) and the [Planetary Society](http://planetary.org).

I’m also involved in some new, exciting projects. In September, I’m traveling on a NASA SOFIA flight, a second generation Airborn Observatory, which I am honored to have been invited too. I’ll be streaming as much from that as I can on StarPower as well!
So please, ask me anything! Star Trek, NASA, singing, gardening, StarPower, anything you like.

"I’m Liara Roux, an escort, indie porn maker, and also a political organizer! I’m here with over 60 sex workers, advocates, educators, policy makers, and trafficking survivors - ask us anything about sex work, decriminalization, trafficking, migrant sex work, and the impact of laws like SESTA/FOSTA!",24001,8stb8o,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/8stb8o/im_liara_roux_an_escort_indie_porn_maker_and_also/,7628,1529627529.0,"#**Hi Reddit! Welcome to our #SexWorkAMA!** 

I’m [Liara Roux](http://aboutliara.com). You may know me - my selfies have ended up on the front page a few times over the years! And you may be familiar with the discussion in the comments under them - many people have been surprised to find out [I’m a sex worker](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/mbkv7a/coming-out-as-a-sex-worker-liara-roux-personal-essay) and curious about what that means. 

Fans on here have asked for an AMA about my work - and seems now’s the time! I didn’t want to just talk about my personal experiences though. [Our community](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/wjbkp9/desiree-conference-canceled-fosta-sesta-sex) has been devastated in the wake of a string of [terrible government policies and laws](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/bjpqvz/fosta-sesta-sex-work-and-trafficking). We already were banned from a lot of internet platforms and it’s been getting worse - we’ve tracked over 150 sites and services that don’t allow sex workers, from PayPal to Skype or even AirBnB, in [a massive 90 page report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c1nqawo1QuiVlpA3bhS8xyDxzDDlRq6BoogAoc91OmU/edit). We’re worried [another upcoming “trafficking” bill](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/human-trafficking-banking-bill-sex-workers_us_5b045577e4b0740c25e5efd1) will result in many sex workers losing their bank accounts - and that’s not a fantastical worry; many people including myself have lost bank accounts in the past for being sex workers, regardless of the legality of their specific work.

Since stigma about our work and state violence against sex workers keeps many in the closet, it’s easy for prohibitionist organizations, law enforcement, and politicians to make up stories about our lives. Many cite all advertisements for sex work online as “instances of trafficking” or “sexual exploitation.” But our real lives are complicated and varied. 

Some of us do work that’s criminalized, some don’t. Some work in person, others make content for stores or work online or on a phone. Some of us work for day to day survival, or have worked under coercion or force, many of us work happily and safely for ourselves. People may be both a victim of prior abuse and now a consensual sex worker. Some of us are lucky to support ourselves, others work hard to support their families. We’re homeless and own homes. We’re working class and famous libertines - or sometimes one branded as the other to the public. What you see of us in public is never the whole story.


We’re coming together as a broader community to push for respect as workers and human beings, and fight for better working conditions and access to the same basic tools and government resources as everyone else. Not everyone loves sex work, but you don’t need to think something is “empowering” to want it to be safer. You don’t even need to respect their work to believe they deserve human rights.

There are many ways to be a sex worker, and there are also important topics to discuss with regards to safety and abuse in the industry. There are valuable lessons to learn from other countries - many people work in places where full service, in person sex work is legal or decriminalized. There are a lot of people in this fight - and it’s global. Today I’ve brought with me some other experts - and put out the invite on social media for more sex workers to join in!

This event had an open call. We’re not handpicking or gatekeeping, just checking to make sure people are who they say they are. Everyone’s experiences and words are their own. I’m not sure an AMA has been done with so many participants before, so we’ll see what happens!

Here’s who we are:

#**Why We’re Here**
[*by Ashley Lake*](https://twitter.com/_AshLake_)


We’re here today to go beyond the ad campaigns and celebrity PSAs to get into the real detail of the sex industry. For example, you’ve heard a lot about sex trafficking, something we all work hard to combat - we know how hard the job can be and no one should be forced into it! But a lot of myths and misconceptions about our industry end up hurting us *and* trafficking victims - we all know people who have been hurt or are no longer with us. It’s also possible for someone to be a survivor of abuse *and* a current sex worker - maybe one who loves their job, maybe one who hates it! But many of the loudest voices in the fight against trafficking are actually faith based organizations who believe the only way to help improve working conditions is to “rescue” sex workers through arrest.

Recently Congress passed a law titled (in the House and Senate) the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act and Stop Enabling Sex Trafficking Act. It sounds great on the surface - no one wants to stop sex trafficking more than sex workers - but the laws don’t actually do anything for trafficking victims at all! There’s no additional funding, no direct aid, no new studies, no task forces, not even more money for law enforcement - the only thing the law does is create additional crimes to do with websites “facilitating prostitution.” The [actual text of § 2421A](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1865/text) mentions “prostitution” 5 times and coercion or force (until now needed to define something as trafficking) zero times. Since the law hit, we’ve lost [valuable safety resources and sexual expression has suffered](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c1nqawo1QuiVlpA3bhS8xyDxzDDlRq6BoogAoc91OmU/edit) - Craigslist even took down their personal ads! 

Here on reddit we [lost forums about sex work](http://reason.com/blog/2018/03/22/reddit-bans-escort-subreddits) as well. While this may seem like a victory to some, the truth is - [supported by empirical studies](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/online-ads-keep-sex-workers-safer-this-bill-could-make-those-ads-illegal_us_5ab16105e4b0decad044d0c0) - taking down these sites doesn’t help people in the sex trade - voluntarily or victims. The internet has [made the sex trade safer](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/23/internet-making-sex-work-safer-report-finds).

[Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.org/en/qa-policy-to-protect-the-human-rights-of-sex-workers/), [the UN’s World Health Organization](http://www.who.int/hiv/topics/sex_work/en/), [ACLU](https://prostitution.procon.org/view.source.php?sourceID=003633), and [Freedom Network USA](https://freedomnetworkusa.org/freedom-network-usa-supports-amnesty-internationals-call-to-decriminalize-sex-work/) (the largest network of anti-trafficking experts in America) all believe decriminalizing consensual sex work is key to combating trafficking - it means we can come to police when we know someone is being abused without worrying about being [abused at the hands of police](https://reason.com/blog/2017/10/13/cops-are-harvey-weinstein-of-sex-work) ourselves.

**What Is LBRY?**

LBRY is a new, completely open-source protocol that allows creators to share digital content with anyone else while remaining strongly in control – for free or for profit.

If you had the LBRY plugin, you’d be able to click URLs like lbry://itsadisaster (to stream the film starring David Cross) or lbry://samhyde2070 (to see the great YouTube/Adult Swim star's epic TEDx troll).

LBRY can also be viewed and searched on it’s own: [here’s a screenshot](https://i.sli.mg/9hqMto.png) 

Unlike every other corporate owned network, LBRY is completely decentralized and controlled by the people who use it. Every computer connected to and running LBRY helps make the network stronger. But we use the power of encryption and the blockchain to keep everything safe and secure.

Looking for my son's heart. In Canada even though the donor and recipient want to meet you can't find each other. Help me find my greatest gift and AMA,23524,a9go6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/a9go6z/looking_for_my_sons_heart_in_canada_even_though/,922,1545788476.0,"Last September 2017 my son was declared brain dead and I decided to try to save the lives of others through this tragedy.  Through the gift of life network in 24 hours we found recipients for 4 of his organs. 

While this was a difficult time for me now and then, I knew my son would have wanted to find something good out of this terrible accident. Initially I thought I would be able to contact the recipients and find out who they were but I misunderstood and we were only able to anonymously write each other after 6 months and only if we both wanted.  

I wrote the heart recipient first as that seems to be easier to do.  While I also wrote the kidney and liver recipient only the heart recipient has replied.  We have now exchanged 3 letters. The latest thank you coming a few days ago with a picture of his heartbeat.  I had sent him my sons with the request he send his back so I could have a tattoo made of my sons heart into his heart. 

 Letters I might add that must be void of names and places that could possibly help us find each other. They are screened vigilantly even though we have both expressed the desire to meet.  This to me is sad. 

 Although it's been such a difficult year,   here is what I know.  The heart recipient is 54 years of age. ( as am I) I know through his letters he has 2 children one is a girl. I know his brother died of a similar heart condition 7 years ago. He seems quite religious  as he thanks God and ""my donor's mother"" a lot.  

We just passed a year recently and I sent him a happy rebirthday letter. He has taken up gardening ( my son loved to garden and he cried when I told him this because he has just started to take this up and his son asked him if his new heart was a gardener in a previous life.   Ok,  wait. Now I know he has a son and a daughter. 

 I am in Brampton. I think he is in the GTA (greater Toronto area ) because he talked about coming into pick up my letter which implies nearby. A heart transplant is a rare thing. Someone has to know someone who had one September 25th 2017 ?  I haven't been able to do Christmas.  Thank you for your help. Ask me anything..

"I am Tom Turcich, 687 days, 16 countries and 9600 miles into my dream of walking around the world. AMA!",23373,6pgo2n,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/6pgo2n/i_am_tom_turcich_687_days_16_countries_and_9600/,1849,1501023545.0,"**My short bio:** What's up Reddit?!

Over two years ago I left my home in New Jersey to embark on a five year, seven continent trek around the world.  In Texas I adopted a dog, [Savannah](https://www.instagram.com/p/BWr8vkuALwh/?taken-by=theworldwalk), and we’ve been walking together ever since.  I’ve been walking for 687 days and have covered 9600 miles over fifteen countries. Currently I’m in Dublin, about to take on Europe and North Africa.

My previous AMA was a year ago and I was in Macará, Ecuador.  From Ecuador I walked through desert for months (and nearly lost my mind), did ayahuasca in the Peruvian jungle, climbed to 15,000 feet to cross the Andes, and stumbled upon the Argentinian Carnival.  After South America I took a ship to Antarctica where I took a plunge in the icy waters and kayaked beside humpbacks.

Savannah was four months old when I adopted her.  When she was a [pup](https://www.instagram.com/p/7lZeLrFp7K/?taken-by=theworldwalk) I pushed her in my cart.  Now she’ll walk thirty miles a day and still be running around at night.  In Central and South America it was fairly easy crossing borders with her.  To get her into Europe we spent a month in New Jersey doing her paperwork (which is easier now than it used to be apparently).  I’ve spent nearly every minute of every day with her since adopting her.  She’s my best friend and a great watch dog at night.

As to why I'm walking around the world, I had a friend, Anne Marie, who died at seventeen. I'd never been close to someone who died before. Her death reordered my understanding of the world. I suddenly saw life as something fragile and fleeting. I needed to make the most of the short time I had - I wanted adventure and to see the world. When I discovered [Karl Bushby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Bushby) the idea of walking around stuck in my head. So from seventeen to twenty-six I kept The World Walk my aim. I went to college, worked, paid off loans, saved, then set off before I had too much responsibility. By twenty-six I had enough saved that if I lived frugally I could walk while still paying off my student loans for two years.

However, about a month before leaving, the owner of [Philadelphia Sign](http://www.philadelphiasign.com/) reached out to me. He knew Anne Marie and wanted to support my walk. Now, Philadelphia Sign gives me enough money to see this thing through and donates a dollar a mile to AnneMarie’s scholarship fund.
If you'd like to follow along I do my best to post photos daily and write a weekly blog post.

**About CERN and the LHC**

[CERN](http://cern.ch) is the European Laboratory for Particle Physics, located in Geneva, Switzerland. Its flagship accelerator is the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which has four main particle detectors: [ALICE](http://aliceinfo.cern.ch/Public/Welcome.html), [ATLAS](http://atlas.ch), [CMS](http://cern.ch/cms) and [LHCb](http://cern.ch/lhcb-public). Nearly three years ago, CMS and ATLAS announced the discovery of a new particle that we now know is a [Higgs boson](http://home.web.cern.ch/topics/higgs-boson). Scientists here are now [looking forward to physics research at unprecedented energies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMc6OCTxIEM&list=PLAk-9e5KQYEpm9HTFxBw44K9QAkbJTJ5X).

"I'm a backpacking ethnomusicologist traveling Indonesia researching and recording rare and endangered traditional music, then sharing it all for free online.",22989,8psvb2,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/8psvb2/im_a_backpacking_ethnomusicologist_traveling/,859,1528580683.0,"My name's Palmer Keen. I'm a guy who's obsessed with music in a corner of the world that most people never even think about, Indonesia. Indonesia is the fourth most populous country in the world and also perhaps the most musically diverse country on the planet, but so much of this music is unknown or unavailable outside the country. My mission is to share this stuff with the world.

For more than four years I've been traveling around Indonesia researching and recording dozens of Indonesian music styles and sharing it all for free on my website, [Aural Archipelago.](http://www.auralarchipelago.com) Without a formal background in ethnomusicology, I've figured it all out as I go: becoming fluent in Indonesian, learning how to do fieldwork, and making connections with musicians and communities across the thousands of islands in the archipelago. I travel with all my gear in a backpack, staying with musicians in their homes, going to remote villages that have never seen foreigners, and finding music that's never been heard outside of these islands. There have been lots of adventures along the way and so, so much great music. 

A few notes to answer FAQ:

How do I make money?/Is this my job?: This isn't my job. For most of the time I've been doing this I was supporting myself and the project by teaching English full time. My description may have been a bit misleading, I travel often but it is not a constant thing. This is a passion project, but I don't make a living from this. I receive donations on my site occasionally, but these are forwarded to musicians. I now also do occasional work as a fixer and guide for others looking for music in Indonesia.

How did you get into this field?: To be clear, I have no academic background in ethnomusicology. I studied the traditional music called gamelan as an extracurricular in university, then decided to move to Indonesia to teach English and learn more about the gamelan that I'd fallen in love with. Since then everything I know about ethnomusicology I've figured out along the way. It's a fascinating field for anyone interested in music, but for those who want to make it their career (again, this is not my career, just a passion project!), it has the same pitfalls of any other job in academia. 

Do you pay the musicians?/Aren't you exploiting them?: Yes, I always pay musicians a reasonable fee for performances that I commission. I'm not releasing whole albums of their music for free, just a track or two to get people interested, something the musicians are very much on board with. The idea is that rather than put this music on albums that won't be affordable for everyone (especially Indonesians themselves), the music is available online for everyone, especially Indonesians and people from these communities who couldn't afford a proper album. 

Ask me anything :)

"IamA Ex-Jehovah's Witness elder, now an activist - I run a website where I publish secret JW documents. AMA!",22968,4zzruz,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4zzruz/iama_exjehovahs_witness_elder_now_an_activist_i/,6708,1472426005.0,"**My short bio:** I come from Poland. I was basically raised as a Jehovah's Witness. My wife and her whole family was one as well. I was a congregation elder, which means I held a position of authority in the congregation. I delivered public talks, conducted public Bible studies, spent some time as a secretary (JWs produce a TON of paperwork!), basically ran the whole circus locally. We had aspiration for me to become a circuit overseer, which is the guy who goes from city to city and makes sure all wishes of the Governing Body are implemented in the congregations. On top of that, both me and my wife served as ""regular pioneers"" for few years, which meant we had to spend ~70 hours preaching every month. This is voluntary, normally JWs don't have any required quota for how many hours they have to report. But they have to do it every month to keep being ""active"".

Two years ago together with my wife we began to wake up from the indoctrination, and then proceeded to help friends and family as well. Unfortunately our families didn't respond well to that. Jehovah's Witnesses call people who leave their faith and put it in negative light ""apostates"". They are prohibited from talking, and even from saying ""hello"" to them, or from reading their blogs, etc. So... our family now refuses to acknowledge us. We have lost them, possibly forever...

We've decided to use our knowledge to help others - to try making people who are still in to see that they are being lied to. I've set up [a website](https://wtsarchive.com) where I publish confidential files that normally are available only to certain people - letters from the HQ to elders, convention videos, old books that are out of print because the doctrine has changed and more. I'm also an admin of polish Ex-JW forums with 500+ members registered (and growing quickly, 48 registered in this month alone). Most recently I've shot a video for the general public which aims to show their practices in a easy to swallow manner: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Hlb1b9SBA

And that's just about it. If that seems interesting to you, **feel free to ask ANYTHING**. I may only refuse to answer some personal details that could identify me, because I don't want to formally leave them just yet, as being inside helps me to help others. I will answer questions today for the next 5-6 hours, and if they are any left, then even tomorrow.

**Short summary about JWs**: Jehovah's Witnesses are an apocalyptic cult started 140 years ago by a guy named Charles Taze Russell. For all this time they have proclaimed that the end is coming soon™. They even set some exact years for this to happen: 1914, 1925, 1975 among others. Currently there are 8 million of them world-wide, over 1.2 million in the USA. While they may seem innocent, their practices hurt people in many different ways. They are hiding child abuse on a grand scale (in Australia alone a Royal Commission unearthed over 1800 cases of child abuse among JWs, none of which was reported to the authorities by them). They destroy families due to their shunning policy - when a member of your family is being disfellowshipped (for example because they slept with someone before getting married, were smoking, took blood in hospital or spoke against the organization). They prohibit blood transfusions which literally takes people's lives. Finally they mess up with your head, telling you that everyone in the outside world is wicked and deserves to die, while you can live forever given that you do exactly as they tell you to.

**My Proof:** [Here's a picture of me](http://imgur.com/uy0YgjC) holding a book that only elders are allowed to have - ""Pay Attention to Yourselves and to All the Flock"", and also an outline of a talk that was delivered on this year's conventions. If that's not enough, I can take photos of newest elders handbook, convention lapel badges or many other publications.

EDIT: More proof - [decades worth of elders-only correspondence](http://i.imgur.com/6RW7VWe.jpg).

UPDATE: Wow, this just exploded. Please bear with me as I try to keep up with all the questions!

UPDATE 2: Thanks for all the questions people, there were so many that unfortunately I couldn't answer them all, but my fellow Ex-JWs managed to answer a few. I will return here tomorrow and try to answer ones that were left unanswered. And even after the AMA ends I urge you to visit r/exjw, you will get even more answers there.

Neonicotinoid pesticides like sulfoxaflor, which are derived from nicotine, have been shown to [reduce bee colony growth](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/336/6079/351.abstract?sid=14fab10a-c2b6-42e3-9940-7cb9285d35a1) and impact [bee navigation and foraging](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/336/6079/348.abstract?sid=14fab10a-c2b6-42e3-9940-7cb9285d35a1). Last week, [the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled](http://earthjustice.org/sites/default/files/files/sulfoxaflor-opinion.pdf) that the EPA should not have approved sulfoxaflor without reliable studies on how it impacts honeybee colonies, meaning the pesticide can’t be used on any crops in the U.S. unless Dow Chemical provides the EPA with much stronger scientific evidence.

Hi Reddit!

Fricking excited to do my first AMA. I don’t want to go all cheesy on you but Reddit is where this journey started for me and how I got this -very- weird job. I owe you. 

So about two years ago I started building robots and posting them on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3KEoMzNz8eYnwBC34RaKCQ)  and /r/shittyrobots. Today I’m a full-time inventor of useless machines and a host of Adam Savage’s [Tested.com](https://www.tested.com). I’m also, more recently, the founder of my own shitty astronaut training program.

North Korean Defector Who is Sending Information to North Korea,22292,5gwqr9,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5gwqr9/north_korean_defector_who_is_sending_information/,2521,1481100242.0,"My name is Park Il Hwan and I am a North Korean defector who is working on the activist movement for ""information dissemination."" I settled in South Korea in 2001 and I majored in law at Korea University. My father gave me a dream. This was a difficult dream to bear while under the North Korean regime. He said, ""If you leave this wretched country of the Kims and go find your grandfather in the U.S., he'll at least educate you."" ""The dream of studying with blue-eyed friends"" was a thought that always made me happy. Enmeshed in this dream, I escaped North Korea all alone without a single relative. This was something my dad had said to my 15-year-old self after having a drink, but this seed of a ""dream"" became embedded deeply in my mind, and as the years went by, it grew so strongly that I couldn't help but bring it to action. I thought carefully about why I wanted this so desperately to risk my life. The words of my father that ""changed my consciousness"" was ""information about the outside world."" The genuine solution to the North Korean issue is the ""change of consciousness"" of the North Korean people. To resolve the issue of North Korean nuclear weapons, there may be different opinions between the Democrat and Republican parties, but despite the change in administration, ""information dissemination"" in North Korea is a movement that must continuously go on. When looking at issues of Muslim refugees or ISIS that show the appearances of clash of civilizations, the above can be said with even more conviction. In the end, even if a totalitarian regime is removed, if there is no ""change in consciousness"" of the people as a foundation, diplomatic approaches or military methods to remove a regime are not solutions for the root issue. The change that I experienced through the ""information dissemination"" that we do to send in USBs or SD cards to North Korea, thus the ""change of consciousness"" among the North Korean people, must be established first as a foundation. Please refer to the link below to find out more details about our ""information dissemination"" work. On Wednesday, December 7th from 10AM - 11AM KST (Tuesday, December 6th 8PM - 9PM EST), I'll be answering your questions. Thank you.

Nearly 70% of America's kids read below grade level. I am Dr. Michael Colvard and I teamed up a producer from The Simpsons to build a game to help. AMA!,22233,50axy9,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/50axy9/nearly_70_of_americas_kids_read_below_grade_level/,2321,1472590221.0,"**My short bio:** Hello, I am Dr. Michael Colvard, a practicing eye surgeon in Los Angeles. I was born in a small farming town in the South. Though my family didn't have much money, I was lucky enough to acquire strong reading skills which allowed me to do well in school and fulfill my goal of practicing medicine. 

I believe, as I'm sure we all do, that every child should be able to dream beyond their circumstances and, through education, rise to his or her highest level. A child's future should not be determined by the zip code they happen to be born into or who their parents are.

Unfortunately, this is not the case for many children in America today. The [National Assessment of Reading Progress study](http://www.nationsreportcard.gov/reading_math_2015/#reading?grade=4) shows year after year that roughly 66% of 4th grade kids read at a level described as ""below proficiency."" This means that these children lack even the most basic reading skills. Further, data shows that kids who fail to read proficiently by the 4th grade almost never catch up.

I am not an educator, but I've seen time and again that many of the best ideas in medicine come from disciplines outside the industry. I approached the challenge of teaching reading through the lens of the neurobiology of how the brain processes language. To paraphrase (and sanitize) Matt Damon in ""The Martian"", my team and I decided to science the heck out of this.

**Why are we doing such a bad job of teaching reading?**
Our kids aren't learning to read primarily because our teaching methods are antiquated and wrong. Ironically, the most common method is also the least effective. It is called **""whole word""** reading. **""Whole word""** teaches kids to see an entire word as a single symbol and memorize it. At first, kids are able to memorize many words quickly. Unfortunately, the human brain can only retain about 2000 symbols which children hit around the 3rd grade. This is why many kids seem advanced in early grades but face major challenges as they progress.


**The Phoneme Farm method**
I teamed up with top early reading specialists, animators, song writers and programmers to build Phoneme Farm. In Phoneme Farm **we start with sounds first**. We teach kids to recognize the individual sounds of language called phonemes (there are 40 in English). Then we teach them to associate these sounds with letters and words. This approach is far more easily understood and effective for kids. It is in use at 40 schools today and growing fast. You can download it free [here for iPad](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/professor-pup-s-phoneme-farm/id1085432161?mt=8) or [here for iPhones](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/professor-pup-s-phoneme-farm/id1085432161?mt=8) to try it for yourself.

**Why I'm here today**
I am here to help frustrated parents understand why their kids may be struggling with reading, and what they can do about it. I can answer questions about the biology of reading, the history of language, how written language is simply a code for spoken language, and how this understanding informs the way we must teach children to read.

And giving is far more valuable than receiving. To be able to make a difference in somebody less fortunate's life is the greatest gift of all.

My father was drafted into the Romanian Army (then allied with Nazi Germany) in 1942, eventually coming home after the Battle of Stalingrad, only to be drafted again in 1944 but this time by the Red Army after the Russians took the Romanian region of Basarabia. 

We were now part of the Soviet Union. I grew up in a house with my Mother and Grandparents. I had a total of 7 brothers and sisters, [3 of whom eventually succumbed to hunger and diseases](http://i.imgur.com/Y36pTR8.jpg) around 1946, when the Soviets started taking all our food to send back to Russia. My Grandpa also died of hunger when he refused to give up his horse. Back then we relied on roots and small rations of soups as everything was for the collective.

In 1956 I finished 7th grade in the local school. I wanted to study, but everything was far away, we had no roads and no chance to reach any other schools so I started learning how to sew from my neighbor in her improvised shop. This unfortunately didn't help our condition as I couldn't earn any money with my skills. 

Once Stalin died, a lot of deported men and women where allowed to go back to their homes, and in 1962 I met one of those men, who wanted us to marry. [We did](http://i.imgur.com/IUjsPAP.jpg), but I set a condition: I would only become his wife if I we moved to his village, Cuza-Voda, since they had a high-school and I could study 3 more years. 

Having finished high-school, I moved to the capital city of Moldova, Chisinau, to become a pharmacist while my husband studied in the Music Collegium. We eventually moved back Cuza-Voda, [had a daughter](http://i.imgur.com/4psvcLj.jpg) and lived through the Soviet Union, after which our country became the independent Republic of Moldova in 1991. It is indeed weird to see all these countries named in such a small region; now imagine having 3 different identities throughout your life: Romanian, Soviet and Moldovan.

"I am the guy whose before and after images went viral after hiking 2000 miles. A whole lot has happened since and I have more stories, a thing to give away, and a burning desire to answer your questions, so AMA!",21824,6s0m9q,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/6s0m9q/i_am_the_guy_whose_before_and_after_images_went/,1547,1502079020.0,"Two and a half years ago [these images](http://i.imgur.com/GjmTxm7.jpg) went viral thanks to [this thread on reddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2ja54e/i_just_hiked_over_2000_miles_from_georgia_to/) 

I posted them the same night I got home from hiking the Appalachian Trail, a 2000 mile footpath from Georgia to Maine. The journey took me 153 days and changed my life. Before I did that I was a consultant for a software company. When I tried to go back, it didn't work. 

For five months my alarm clock was birds. I felt the sun, wind and rain on my face every day. Switching back to right angles and deadlines gave me genuine panic attacks.

I spent the following 11 months exhausting my savings and racking up debt so I could go back into the woods and work it out on paper. I took a small tablet and bluetooth keyboard into the forest closest to home and lived by waterfalls and streams again, this time putting it down in a way that makes sense, not just to hikers.  

But... What I also wanted to do, was *entertain*. Too many hiking books are written diary style. *Day 42: 18 miles. Oatmeal again.* No one wants to read that. 

***[Where's the Next Shelter?](http://www.wheresthenextshelter.com/)*** is what I brought back from the woods. It's nonfiction but reads like a novel. I've been told it's funny which is good because I meant it to be.  Imagine how I'd feel otherwise. It's thought provoking, full of surprises, and most importantly, for the rest of August 6th, **[it's FREE](http://www.wheresthenextshelter.com/)**. 

By some miracle, enough people who weren't my mom liked it and now I get to hike and write full time. I live in the woods (literally, my house is in a forest now) and I get to work with the trail and all the wonderful people who surround it. 

I teach for REI, moderate /r/AppalachianTrail, sit on the board of the Appalachian Long Distance Hikers Association, I've recorded an[ audio book](http://www.wheresthenextshelter.com/), and have recently been [telling stories for NPR's The Moth](https://youtu.be/9OU430FXKYU). 

This is the happiest and busiest I've been since quitting my office job! One might even say I'm obsessed with the outdoors. If you're wondering how someone goes from being *kinda* normal to throwing it all away to go live outside, you're in luck. That's what my current book is about. 

***[Home is Forward](https://www.garysizer.com)*** tells the story of my comedic descent into madness. It starts in boot camp, the first time I ever slept in a tent and takes us through jungles, over tundra and on top of glaciers. It's even a bit of a love story, too. Gross. 

So thanks for looking. I've got tons of stories and plenty of opinions, and I'm ready to go. Whatcha got?

What's up ladies and gents. I'm Stefan and I have been teaching people to control their dreams using 'lucid dreaming' for about a year or so. 

I founded the website http://howtolucid.com (It's down right now because there's too much traffic going to it, check back in a day or two) and wrote a handful of books on the subject. Lucid dreaming is the ability to become 'aware' of the fact that you're dreaming WHILE you're in the dream. This means you can control it.

You can control anything in the dream.. What you do, where you go, how it feels etc...You can use it to remove fears from your mind, stop having nightmares, reconnect with lost relatives or friends, and much more. 

For proof that I'm actually Stefan, here's a Tweet sent from the HowToLucid company Twitter - https://twitter.com/howtolucid/status/768052997947592704

Also another proof, here is my author page (books I've written about lucid dreaming) - https://www.amazon.com/Stefan-Z/e/B01KACOB20/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1?qid=1471961461&sr=8-1

I lived as a child in Cuba for 7 years-we left when the revolution began. Our plane left Havana and the next plane was shot down. I then moved back to the states and ended up going to LSU, graduated medical school in 1950. My residency was at Charity Hospital in New Orleans. My first job was Crown Point in New Mexico, working with the Navahos for 9 months.

After that I went to Alaska, and I was supposed to work in Anchorage, but the Native Alaskan Hospital was not finished. So I went to Tanana, in the middle of Alaska, and ran the hospital as the only doctor. I had 18 villages, none connected by roads and so I had to go by float plane and dogsled. I was a dentist, surgeon, OB, psychiatrist (whatever was needed)... holding clinics every 5-6 weeks and seeing everybody in the village. 

I have delivered a baby in a plane, gone on rescue trips up the frozen Yukon on dogsled, had many babies named after me, and many more adventures!

I also wrote a book called ""From Dog Sleds to Float Planes"" which I sell mostly from home but there are copies on Amazon too!

**About the World Wide Web** | [Watch “A brief history of the Web”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSqZ_hJu9zA)

> Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist, invented the World Wide Web (WWW) in 1989, while working at CERN. The Web was originally conceived and developed to meet the demand for automated information-sharing between scientists in universities and institutes around the world.
> 
> The first website at CERN – and in the world – was dedicated to the World Wide Web project itself and was hosted on Berners-Lee's NeXT computer.
> 
> On 30 April 1993, CERN put the World Wide Web software in the public domain. Later, CERN made a release available with an open licence, a more sure way to maximise its dissemination. These actions allowed the Web to flourish.

YouTube is the most watched video platform in human history. Its algorithm-driven recommendation system played a role in driving some Brazilians toward far-right candidates and electing their new president, Jair Bolsonaro. Since taking office in January, he and his followers govern Brazil via YouTube, using the trolling and provocative tactics they honed during their campaigns to mobilize users in a kind of never-ending us-vs-them campaign.

I'm sitting here with my 95 year old german grandmother. [Proof](http://imgur.com/0kKY9tj).

Some pictures of her: http://imgur.com/a/QIHlo

She is a very active women but had a stroke a few months ago. Now she has difficulties to walk and use her right hand (and she loved to write).
Before her story gets lost I thought I document it and an AMA seems like a great way to give young people like me the opprtunity to ask questions.
Her experience is very valuable to me, and it would be sad if it just would get lost.

She was born in May 1920, is now 95 years old and lived all her life in a village in the beautiful Black Forest.
She went to board school from 6-14y/o and went to a college of housecraft afterwards, where she took afternoon lessons in office work. She learned shorthand and to write with a typewriter. She got her first job with 17 in a law and collection office. At this time she was also active in the [Bund deutscher Mädchen (BDM)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_German_Girls) and in a girl church group. Leaders from the BDM didn't support her role in the church group and wanted that she stops going there, but she refused and was
called ""stubborn"".

From 1939 to 1945 she worked at a company where the wife of the owner and her brother were half jews. But they were the only jews in the village and they didn't get imprisoned, because their company was important for the war. They manufactured fabrics for uniforms. In 1944 she got engaged with her first partner. But he had to go into the war. He was missing for 7 years, until she got notice that he died in the war at christmas eve, when Englishman attacked on the 24th december. Her father was also in the war in 1942 as a medic. He then got captured by Russian soldiers and was in war imprisonment for 3 1/2 years. When he came back he was wearing rags and was extremely underweight from starvation and work.

Her village was occupied by the French, or to be more exact Moroccans. They were not allowed to leave the house, but she did it anyway and almost got shot.

In 1955 she got engaged to my grandfather. His first wife died during the war in Düsseldorf because of bombing. When he was in the war, he was in russian war imprisonment and was later transfered to a French prison. He died in 2000 in a car accident.

If you are looking about a topic to ask, she is very proud of the jobs. She always worked and was not a stay-at-home mom.

**07:25:50 EDT | 13:25:50 CEST:** we just had lunch. We are now waiting for questions. She skips her after-lunch nap for you all.

**09:15:07 EDT | 15:15:07 CEST:** My oma has a great time. She wants to answer every question. We will make a short coffee break. We will be back in a few minutes.

**10:39:23 EDT | 16:39:23 CEST:** My grandmother can't comprehend how 3800 people like to hear about it. And that there are over 1000 comments.

**13:01:13 EDT | 19:01:13 CEST:** We are eating dinner really quick. We will be right back. Gosh... an AMA is really a lot of work!


**15:00:05 EDT | 21:00:05 CEST:** We decided to answer some `new` comments. But she is very tired now. After over 7 hours without her nap, she is very exhausted. We will answer some more questions tomorrow. Please upvote some unanswered questions :)

**07:15:31 EDT | 13:15:31 CEST:** We will answer some more questions now

**08:32:03 EDT | 14:32:03 CEST:** Now we have to drink coffee with relatives. We celebrate easter a little bit here. We will probably come back to a few questions later tonight.

Thank you very much for participating. She was very happy today.

We are the only white tablecloth restaurant in the country whose staff consists entirely of formerly incarcerated men and women in both the kitchen and the front of house.

Individuals are not only equipped with basic culinary skills, but are also assisted with finding employment, housing, basic medical care, clothing, job coaching and literacy programs. We have trained more than 166 students and only 1.2% have re-offended. We also teach the same course in prisons around the state of Ohio.

If you like the Muppets - it's a movie for anybody. It does have a few words that puts it into not suitable for children, but I don't think it would hurt any children. It's for children old enough to know that Big Bird isn't a real bird, just me.

But everybody has loved the movie. The music is particularly beautiful in the movie. And I urge you to see it, if you like what we do. It's really quite a love story in there, about somebody I love very much.

While we only intended to play a few small shows and have a couple laughs, the band's original demo and press photos went a bit viral, earning us 20k Facebook fans and 1 million bandcamp plays in less than 2 weeks. Since then, we've released 2 records, played multiple US and international shows and more recently, had our music video for ""White Wine Spritzer"" played during the credits of an actual episode of The Simpsons.

IamA guy who was falsely accused of molesting my stepdaughter by my ex wife after I asked for a divorce. I was arrested and convicted of a sex crime and sentenced to 15 years in prison. After 17 months of incarceration I was able to prove my innocence and out of prison. AMA!,20184,2dlqut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2dlqut/iama_guy_who_was_falsely_accused_of_molesting_my/,4349,1408102018.0,"Not too long ago in a state not too far away, but mostly forgotten, I was arrested, tried, and convicted of child molestation.  The charges were false, the proof nonexistent, but that didn't seem to matter to the Assistant DAs that were assigned to my case. 

The story starts a few years back:
It's very long and if it didn't happen to me, almost unbelievable story of lies, theft, overzealous county workers, and betrayal.  I swear it would make a great ""Lifetime"" movie...   

All of my troubles started after I found out my (now ex) wife was having ANOTHER affair and stealing money from my bank and credit accounts.  I confronted her and after a lot of argument I told her that I wanted a divorce and custody of my son.  The next day She starts laughing and saying that my stepdaughter said I had abused her (which was a lie) and that she would be calling the police.  
Because MS would have allowed me to sue for denial of affection, and that I had a very good case in which I could not only keep most of my assets (most of which I had long before I married the woman) but also likely get custody of my son and make her pay me child support, she played the trump card that so many do now a days.  She called the police and said I did things to my step daughter that I didn't do and got her to relay some of the information to the police as well (however almost none of it matched nor was it consistent, but the ADA didn't care)

Yeah, so my saga started off with my first attorney.  He seemed like a decent lawyer and all, but right after I gave him my last payment he tells me that he took a Federal Public defenders position and had to recuse himself from my case.  Yay!  However, he tells me not to worry because he hired a ""really good"" attorney (second attorney or Attorney #2) who had tried cases like mine many times and will do really well with my ""open and shut case"".  

Long story short, attorney #2 tells me not to worry and that he's going to hire experts to refute the claims made by my stepdaughter and my ex-wife and have several of my long term friends testify for me and against my ex in court.  I give #2 copious amounts of financial and phone records to show that my ex was cheating and having multiple affairs, I also give him copious amounts of text messages where my ex was sending me pictures of my stepdaughter (unsolicited BTW) and conversations showing that she obviously knows the allegations are false.  

Fast forward to the trial and the first day Attorney #2 tells the court that our expert is going to show up the next day and that I have several witnesses to testify on my behalf.  The prosecutor objects because she apparently never received warning that we would have an expert (she knew I had experts and witnesses because Attorney #2 told her in front of me well before the trial, but Attorney #2 never put it in writing).  Regardless the Judge says we can discuss the expert situation when they go over the guys experience before allowing him to testify as an expert. After the trial starts Attorney #2 essentially quits leaving the guy who was supposed to just ""help"" as second chair to try the case.  The only problem is that I never talked to this guy about the case and he was flying blind.  When we tried to enter my evidence the prosecutor objects because Attorney #2 never turned in any of my information during discovery.  So, in essence this guy never did any of his pre-trial work and we had no proof to back up any of my claims.  When the prosecution rests I know I'm in trouble because we couldn't refute any of the lies they were saying because I had no proof or evidence.  The next day when the defense is supposed to take the stand I find out that my expert never showed up, even though I had paid Attorney #2  for him, and that there wasn't going to be anyone other than myself to testify on my behalf.  FUN!

With no evidence on my side it was all a “he said she said” situation.  The prosecutor did well in making me out to be a bad guy because I made good money but wouldn't go see my son (even though she was the one who put a no contact order on me for most of the pretrial time) and that my ex wouldn't agree to the visitation since she had moved out of the state after the start of the whole mess.  She also made it out to sound like I never gave my ex money for support, which was a lie as I was giving her over $1200 a month and paying most of her bills to support her and my son, but I couldn't prove it because none of my financial records were allow in as evidence.  Anyhow, long story short, with no evidence, no witnesses, and no expert of my side it only took the Jury 4 hours to deliberate and find me guilty.  

After the trial I found out that Attorney #2 had never paid my ""expert"" and that was why the guy never showed up. So not only did he lie to me but also lied to the court saying that I had an expert, which he knew I didn't since he took my money but never paid the guy.

Once I found this out I immediately fired Attorney #2 and found two good attorneys who I nicknamed “The Wonder Twins”.  I had to essentially sell everything I owned and borrowed money from friends and family to pay ""The Wonder Twins"".  With their help we were able to place a motion for retrial.  This motion normally happens within a few weeks after trial but because the prosecutor knew that we had enough evidence to say my first trial wasn't fair after we had a 6 month continuance on our side they delayed the hearing for another year.  So, after 1.5 years I got back into court and was able to start proving  that Attorney #2 was infective.  However, we never finished the whole brief.  One reason was that even if the Judge were to grant me a new trial I would have to stay locked up for another year at minimum waiting for my new trial to start.  The prosecution wasn't about to admit that my ex wife fooled them so they kept offering me plea deals to stop everything from moving forward.  I denied them until they came to one that dropped the nasty sex charge and let me out immediately.  In essence I took a plea for a lesser charge with time served and they let me out.  So, yeah, I am a convicted felon now, but I don't have to register or do probation like I would have with the other charge and I get to avoid another trial.  (The felony is going to make finding a job a lot harder but again, I got to come home and get out of prison).  
I did find it very ironic that I had to lie under oath and say I committed a crime that I didn't do to keep the prosecution from pressing charges on another crime I didn't do.  
Next week I am pressing felony embezzlement charges on Attorney #2 and plan to push it through.  I have plenty of proof to show he lied to me and to the court about my expert along with many other things.  I also plan to do several bar complaints again him and I'm going to try the same with the ADA since she knowing lied during my trial and pressed the case forward after receiving proof that it was not true.  I seriously doubt my complaints about the ADAs will go anywhere.  I'm also going to start the long process of trying to get custody of my son (if he even turns out to be mine after a DNA test), which I haven't seen since he was 6 months old.

So, that's the very short version of everything.  I am leaving A LOT of stuff out since it's too much to put into this AMA.


TL;DR: My ex lied to the police to keep from losing custody and all the assets she had stolen from me in a divorce.  I got shammed by a crooked attorney who stole my money and didn't even do cross during my trial and ""forgot"" to submit any of my evidence.  I hire new lawyers, take it all back to court and I win to some extent.  Instead of spending 15 years mandatory time I got out in 17 months. I’m and ex-con but at least I don’t have to register as a sex offender.

Ok, after a lot of people asking I set up a Gofundme account to receive donations for my legal fees associated with my legal defense, to help prosecute the corrupt attorney who stole my money, and to seek custody of my son and possibly sue my ex wife.  Any left over money will be donated to charities who aid victims of child abuse.



Update #9
The vast majority of the people I have met in Mississippi are good honest people who get a fairly bad wrap in the media when it comes to their state.  I should not have tried to bash the whole state in my comments as I do have many friends here and it's a lovely place to live.  If it wasn't for my experience with the legal system I would be very happy here.  I apologize to all Mississippi residents, current, former or future for my harsh words and generalization of your state.  Please forgive me.  

Update #10

OK gang, I deleted my Gofundme account.  Anyone who donated should receive their money back.  Please contact Gofundme if you have not.

I didn't make the post for money.  I wrote the post because I hoped telling my side of the story would be therapeutic.  It's been fun and very frustrating at the same time, however once money was involved things moved to a whole new level.  Even though I could certainly use the extra cash I would much rather not deal with the BS surrounding it.
For those of you who did pledge money, I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your compassion.  

Update #11
Some clarification.  I stated earlier that I could have sued my ex for ""denial of affection"", that was incorrect.  It's call ""Alienation of Affection"".

We're ethical hackers who spent our spare time over a decade coming up with a hack that created a master key for hotel rooms around the world. Ask us anything!,19853,8ins5w,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/8ins5w/were_ethical_hackers_who_spent_our_spare_time/,1341,1526074487.0,"EDIT: Thank you for all the questions! It's 7:05PM in Finland and we are off for the weekend :).

Some people play football. Some people play golf. We like to solve mysteries. This is Tomi Tuominen, Practice Leader at F-Secure Cyber Security Service, and Timo Hirvonen, Senior Security Consultant at F-Secure. About a decade ago we were at an infosec conference in Berlin. We learned that a laptop of a fellow researcher was stolen from a locked hotel room while they were out. There were no signs of forced entry, not a single indication of unauthorized room access -- nothing physical and nothing in the software logs. The hotel staff simply refused to believe it happened. But we never forgot. We figured that it might be possible to exploit the software system and create a master key basically out of thin air. It took a decade of countless hours of our own time but last month we finally revealed our research, after working with the manufacturer to fix the vulnerability.  
 
Now, for the first time, we're here to answer all the questions we can without violating ethical agreements with manufacturers and customers about our day jobs hacking businesses for a living and our hobby of hacking hotels.

"IamA private tutor to the children of the lawyers, doctors, and executives of NYC. Basically, I get paid $140/hr to do science experiments with kids!",19843,69evqx,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/69evqx/iama_private_tutor_to_the_children_of_the_lawyers/,2335,1494022030.0,"**My short bio:** Hi reddit,

My last AMA on /r/entrepreneur got pretty popular, so I figured I'd do one here too!

I'm Shay Skobeleva, 25 years old, and I work as a private tutor for the children of the lawyers, doctors, and executives of NYC. 

I went to university for genetics, but became disillusioned with the field after going to medical school. I decided to leave medical school and start a private tutoring company, and I couldn't be happier! I get to work with kids of all ages, and use science experiments to teach them more interesting math and science concepts than they're getting in school. 

I also teach pretty much every other subject, and do test prep. Surprisingly, there's a huge demand in the fall for prep for the Gifted and Talented Kindergarten Entry exam here in NYC. That boils down to **training 4-year olds to take an 80 question test!** 

I usually work between 10-15 hours/week, and spend my spare writing books, doing art projects, and inventing things.


My latest e-book is a [sarcastic textbook on personal hygiene](https://www.amazon.com/Hygiene-Practice-Principle-Shay-Skobeleva-ebook/dp/B06ZZNN2W8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1494023457&sr=8-1&keywords=hygiene:+practice+and+principle&linkCode=ll1&tag=altiora20-20&linkId=ca9cfc0f0b50780f88cf1c39f235d9c6) that I wrote after having some exceptionally smelly hall-mates in college. It makes a great gag gift for siblings.

EDIT: Over 1,000 downloads! Thanks guys, and I hope you guys enjoy it! 

I also wrote a more serious premed guide, which you can see [here](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Into-Medical-School-Ultimate-ebook/dp/B00K87UJVU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1494023495&sr=8-7&keywords=getting+into+medical+school&linkCode=ll1&tag=altiora20-20&linkId=d78b78a87a2ce74595827eec2366929d).

Invention wise, I recently used my experience working on mosquito research at Caltech to invent this low-cost, DIY, [Portable Mosquito Netting design](http://www.zikashield.net) to try and help stop the spread of Zika Virus. 


**EDIT:** A lot of people are asking about how I feel about the disparity between the ability of my clients to afford this prep and the ability of the less wealthy. This is something that I actively aim to combat, by releasing free test prep resources on my website. This past year, I wrote a free 50-question practice test for the Gifted and Talented Exam, which is unheard of in the industry. Additionally, I wrote downloadable practice tests for around 1/3 of the cost of the competition, as well as a free book on how to effectively study with your kids at home. Those are available [here](http://www.altiora.NYC/publications). I'm actively writing more materials and producing videos to give away for free or low cost, more will come out in the next months!

So, Ask Me Anything!

My name is Jen Briney and I spend most of my time reading through the ridiculously long bills that are voted on in US Congress and watching fascinating Congressional hearings. I use my podcast to discuss and highlight corporate influence on the bills. **I've recorded [93 episodes](http://www.congressionaldish.com/) since 2012.**

Most Americans, if they pay attention to politics at all, only pay attention to the Presidential election. **I think that’s a huge mistake** because we voters have far more influence over our representation in Congress, as the Presidential candidates are largely chosen by political party insiders.

**My passion drives me** to inform Americans about what happens in Congress after the elections and prepare them for the effects legislation will have on their lives. I also want to inspire more Americans to vote and run for office.

**I look forward to any questions you have! AMA!!**

**EDIT:** Thank you for coming to Ask Me Anything today! After over 10 hours of answering questions, I need to get out of this chair but I really enjoyed talking to everyone. Thank you for making my first reddit experience a wonderful one. I’ll be back. Talk to you soon! Jen Briney

I tend to stay pretty active here on Reddit and on Twitter (@bdbrode), but I am excited to solicit questions directly – Reddit /AMA’s format is super cool.

I was hungry, hadn't eaten in 24hrs, was 48hrs from having my electricity shut off, a week from losing my apartment, and I had 0.33 in my bank account. The post blew up in a way I did not expect and I was able to pay my electric bill and buy food the next day. I reposted a few times asking for more money each time, and the number of customers continued to increase. I started getting reviews posted about my services and I quickly reached a point where scheduling became a nightmare and I was struggling to meet the demand without an organized system in place. I made the leap to buy a domain and build a website three days ago, and I raised my prices to $20 an hour. I've been booked solid the past four days and I'm equal parts excited and terrified.

I didn't submit to any big film festivals, I didn't shoot with Red or Alexa, and I didn't give up when a more experienced producer told me I would fail. Moreover, I broke just about every rule in the book, and disobeyed most of the traditional advice nuggets in the process. 

Feel free to ask me about working with Les Miles, Friday Night Lights' Brad Leland (Buddy Garrity), Parks and Rec's Jim O'Heir (Jerry Gergich), or any of the amazing actors involved. Moreover, feel free to ask about how I raised the money, how we found a distributor, and why I didn't submit to any big festivals.

I logged off right when some more vitriolic questions started to flow in, and my lack of reply didn't help. Luckily, the positive threads will be up top for those who are here for a learning experience, rather than to troll. That's thanks to the good people out there. Number two: lots of talk about IMDb rating and how it affects box office, and whether box office is overall profit or just theatrical profit. For those who don't know the different between the three, there's plenty. For those who do, feel free to fill in the blanks where I couldn't. Number three: Thank you to all of you who pitched in to help me answer questions and explain tougher concepts. Education is a community effort.

A few brief predictions for 2019:

* **Cheaper oil = cheaper fares.** Airline CEOs spent much of the first half of 2018 predicting (wishing?) that airfare will get more expensive, pointing to the rising price of oil. But with the price of oil down 40% in last 3 months of 2018, one of the main drivers of expensive flights is off the table.
* **Worldwide economic slowdown is bad in general but probably good for airfare.** Many economists are predicting slower economic growth in 2019 and 2020. When times are tight, discretionary spending like vacations are one of the first items on a family's budget chopping block. Lower demand for plane seats will force the airlines to cut fares in an attempt to woo those travelers back.
* **Hawaii flights are going to get even cheaper.** Southwest is set to imminently begin flying from the mainland US to Hawaii (and between Hawaiian islands). Other airlines like Alaska, United, and American have already been dropping their fares in anticipation, but I expect that trend to continue even more in 2019. Plus with free checked bags and free changes/cancellations, many flyers will find Southwest's Hawaii flights especially valuable.
* **Mistake fares will continue.** Mistake fares are when an airline or online travel agency like Expedia or Orbitz accidentally offers fares that are *significantly* lower than normal. For instance, the $130 nonstop roundtrip flight from NYC to Milan that jumpstarted my career in cheap flights. Though not common, they show no signs of abating and should give flyers more opportunities at rare deals in 2019.

**Hello Reddit!**
My name is Scott Kelly. I am a NASA astronaut who has been living aboard the International Space Station since March of last year, having just passed 300 days of my [**Year In Space**](http://www.nasa.gov/content/one-year-crew), an unprecedented mission that is a stepping stone to future missions to Mars and beyond. I am the first American to spend a whole year in space continuously. 

On this flight, my fourth spaceflight, I also became the record holder for total days in space and single longest mission. A year is a long time to live without the human contact of loved ones, fresh air and gravity, to name a few. While science is at the core of this groundbreaking spaceflight, it also has been a test of human endurance. 

Connections back on Earth are very important when isolated from the entire world for such a period of time, and I still have a way to go before I return to our planet. So, I look forward to connecting with you all back on spaceship Earth to talk about my experiences so far as I enter my countdown to when I will begin the riskiest part of this mission: coming home.

Since I'm a radiologist, I want to show you my proof of all this like doctors show other doctors cases. I've tried to remove the really technical words and replace them with words that everyone will understand. If you're a medical person and want to read it in its full, annoying doctor shorthand glory, check out my post in [/r/medicine](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/51o49k/32_yearold_previously_healthy_male_presents_with/). 

===============


**History of present illness:** The patient is a 32 year old male with a history vague and intermittent abdominal pain for the past two years. He has no other significant medical problems. Previously, the pain had been easily controlled with intermittent use of over the counter medications, but in the last couple of weeks had become acutely more painful and the pain became persistently present. On the day of presentation, the pain localized to the right lower quadrant which prompted the emergency room visit.

**Past medical/surgical history:** Well controlled high blood pressure. Prior sebaceous cyst and wisdom tooth removals.

**Meds/Allergies:** Lisinopril 20 mg daily (blood pressure med). No know drug allergies.

Other history non-contributory.

**Relevant labs:** Sedementation rate and C-reactive protein, both generalized markers of inflammation, are markedly elevated. Mild low blood counts with hemoglobin (basically, red blood cells) just below the normal cut-off. All other labs normal.

==========

Some brief information about radiology conventions: we diagnostic radiologists like to pretend we're real doctors, so we always ""look at the patient"" when reading studies. So basically it's like we're standing at the foot of the patient's bed and looking at them, in the same way that if you face someone and look to your left, you'll notice that's their right. So, functionally, left and right are reversed on our pictures. It starts to make sense after a while (but I now sometimes confuse left and right like a ~~kindergartner~~ 3-year-old. Thanks radiology!)

We also have 3 major planes of imaging: axial, coronal, and sagittal. A picture, as they say, is worth a thousand words, [so just look at this](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/e9/6d/aa/e96daae82cf277634d93f43fe0839638.jpg) to understand what I'm talking about below, if it doesn't make sense.

And so without further ado, here's some proof of my shit-tastic disease:

=============

**Initial CT Scan**

1. [Axial CT at the level of the liver](https://imgur.com/UiWFaAL): Right from the get-go, things are looking grossly abnormal. There's organized fluid over the liver dome, which suggests it's thicker than just some water in the belly. There's some ill-defined, hazy shmutz (technical term) along the bottom curve of the stomach which is changing the appearance of the normal intra-abdominal fat. We radiologists say, ""fat is your friend"" because it looks black on CT. It helps separate out different structures so we can see where exactly something is. When there's too much white stuff on the black stuff, it tells us something isn't quite right.

2. [Axial CT at the level of the kidneys](http://imgur.com/i1xMvKU): More belly fluid and possibly some enlarged/big lymph nodes along the major blood vessels. If you look just ""above"" the spine (it's really in front - think about those imaging planes), that's where the blood vessels run and, in general, the lymphatic system runs with the blood vessels. The lymphatic system is basically part of your immune system, so when lymph nodes get big, it means that your immune system is trying to fight something. So that's where we look for evidence of disease outside of the primary location it started. It's hard to see anything discreet/measurable because everything is kind of smushed together and covered with belly fluid, but there's a round, abnormal nodule near or in part of the small intestine.

3. [Axial CT upper pelvis](http://imgur.com/CGYs1Ft): The right colon is ""jacked up,"" which is an official medical description. In all seriousness, though, there is a grossly abnormal appearance to the right sided large bowel, the colon, with significant wall thickening. See that big ugly circle thing on the left side of the picture (the radiology right side)? That's not normal *at all.* The bowel wall should be very thin, smooth, and uniform. Also, there's too much white stuff on the black stuff again in the middle of the belly. Something about it just doesn't look right after you've seen a bunch of normal scans and know what it's supposed to look like.

4. [Axial CT mid-pelvis](http://imgur.com/WuqgxTj): Well, on the plus side, it's not appendicitis. That big arrow is pointing to a normal appendix. You may have to take my word for it, though. Again note the abnormal appearance of the colon.

5. [Axial CT lower pelvis](http://imgur.com/JbxT192): This picture is lower down in the pelvis. Those big white things on either side are the pelvis bones. All that uniform appearing dark-ish stuff that's the same color as what the circle is drawn around is fluid. In a man, pelvic free fluid is never normal and should prompt a search for the underlying cause. In a woman, it's normal to see a small amount of free fluid. It's related to the menstrual cycle. But even this is way too much pelvic fluid for a woman, too.


===============

One thing people, even other doctors, sometimes don't understand about radiology is that, we're not *directly* looking at jack squat. These pictures are just a really fancy density map of the body. The white parts were where a bunch of x-rays get absorbed. The black parts are where a bunch of x-rays can pass through the tissue without getting absorbed. Everything else is a shade of grey, and we can only tell you, really, about the relative differences in density. 

Sometimes, that means we can make the diagnosis with great confidence. Radiologists call those ""aunt minnies,"" because it's so obvious that even your Aunt Minnie can see the finding. But more often than not, things look the same. A lot of diseases from very different categories (i.e., malignancy/cancer versus inflammatory versus autoimmune versus vascular, etc.) can look the same. And so we, as radiologists, try to look at the pictures, evaluate them, and then say what it could be, preferably in order of probability. We call that the differential diagnosis. Other physicians do the exact same thing with people's stories and labs. We just do it from the pictures.

So hopefully that will drive home this point: When everybody (the ER, the GI doctors, the surgeons, and the radiologists) looked at the pictures, this was our differential diagnosis: (1) inflammatory bowel disease (things like Crohn's or ulcerative colitis) (2) inflammatory bowel disease (3) inflammatory bowel disease (4) something besides inflammatory bowel disease. That is how I would still read a case like this, quite frankly. And it made sense. Those things *fit* with my age and symptoms. I wasn't some old guy with a bunch of cancer risk factors. I was actually in okay shape, just overweight according to my BMI (probably just from my huge, arnold-style muscles, duh). I exercised a few times a week. I don't think that cancer was even on anybody's radar at the time.

So what do you do when they think there's something wrong in the colon? They shove a camera up your butt. I got to drink a gallon of what is basically salt water to clean it all out before they could take a look. That stuff is nasty. Anyway, the colonoscopy was... normal. So I thought I was good. We still had that nodule thing up in the small bowel near the stomach, but it's not all *that* rare for people to have benign tumors in their GI tract (meaning, the fact that they're there and that the grow is not normal, but they won't turn into cancer). No one could explain the right colon findings to my satisfaction, but hey - at least I didn't have Crohn's disease, right! Hooray!

Well, we still had that mass in or near the small bowel. They stuck another camera down my throat, through my stomach, into the small bowel. The camera also comes with an ultrasound probe on the end, too (nifty, right?), and so they looked at that thing really close up and were able to take samples of it with a small needle by using the ultrasound pictures to guide them. We sent that off to the lab for the pathologists (the experts in tissue, and the people who are the gold standard test for making any cancer diagnosis). 

They also thought the CT scan didn't give them enough information, so they decided to get an MRI of the belly too. Just as an aside, CAT scan is like nails on a chalkboard to a radiologist. They're ""computed tomography"" scans. ""See Tee scans."" When you say CAT scan, [this is what I think of](https://imgur.com/6ZXalUD). And so now you know. And that's half the battle, as those important childhood lessons learned from GI Joe remind us all.

Just a bit about our radiology tests, too. People think that x-rays are the worst, then CT is better than that, and then MRI is the best of all. I mean, kind of. Really, you use different modalities depending on what question you're trying to answer. X-rays are actually still the best first test for a suspected broken bone, for instance. As I said above, CT makes a density map of the body, and that's useful for a lot of things, actually, too many to list here. 

But MRI is a bit different. In an MRI, we have a really strong, always-on (it's a superconducting magnet) magnetic field. It turns out that when you put protons into this field, just-over-half of them will ""line up"" in the direction of the magnetic field (the other slightly-fewer-than-half face the other way). Once we get everybody ""facing the same way,"" we shoot a radio pulse into the protons. This basically knocks them over, and as they stand back up to face the way they were facing before, they send some radio wave energy back out, and we can listen for that. And the *really* neat trick is that protons stand back up at different rates depending on their environment, so a proton inside of a pathologic lesion is almost certainly going to ""look"" different than one in normal tissue. So it's a lot easier to tell apart tissues of *juuuuuuust* a little bit of difference. Radiologists call this ""contrast resolution."" 

Anyway, here's what my MRI looked like:

=======================

**Initial MRI**

1. [Axial fat-suppressed T2](http://imgur.com/F0n1jR4): Since we know what the fat signal is going to be (since we know how fast fat protons ""stand back up""), we can send a signal into the scanner at the right time that's the exact opposite of the fat signal, and they cancel each other out. This is called ""fat suppression."" T2-weighted images a basically ""fluid sensitive"" images. If it's really bright on T2, it's probably fluid. So this is just proving that the stuff around the liver is fluid. 

2. [Axial fat-suppressed T2](http://imgur.com/0dFkebi): The stuff in the pelvis is also fluid. Look how it fills the potential spaces on either side of the urinary bladder. This is bad news bears.

3. [Axial C+ fat-suppressed LAVA](http://imgur.com/5YoolTC): C+ means that these pictures were taken after they gave contrast. Contrast (as is probably obvious from the name) helps you differentiate between tissue types. It's generally related to the amount of blood flow to the lesion. Since tumors like to grow, and growing things need nutrients, tumors secrete proteins that tell your body to build new blood vessels to them. So, tumors usually light up after you give people contrast. There's an abnormal enhancing lesion along the lesser curvature of the stomach, helpfully demarcated by the measurement tool. Additionally, note the abnormal enhancement around the margin of the spleen along the lining of the abdominal cavity.

4. [Axial C+ fat-suppressed LAVA](http://imgur.com/AOZZsUt): This is what that small bowel nodule looks like on MRI. It's a bit easier to define the margins. It's still unclear whether this is inside or outside of the bowel, but it's definitely abnormal.

5. [Axial C+ fat-suppressed LAVA](http://imgur.com/y9G8qsl): Grossly abnormal thickening and enhancement of the right colon. Some of the enhancement along the surface of the abdominal cavity is normal, and some is abnormal. Trying to figure out the difference can be VERY tough on MRI. When you're not sure if it's normal or abnormal, the diffusion sequences can be very helpful. Self-respecting tumors will generally restrict diffusion, a concept I will explain presently. See below for more info.

6. [Axial C+ fat-suppressed LAVA](http://imgur.com/cqllFHh): Enhancing nodule or lymph node in the right pelvis. Again, some of the belly surface enhancement is probably abnormal, but it can be difficult to determine how much enhancement is too much.

7. [Coronal C+ fat-suppressed LAVA](http://imgur.com/5qEVMpU): Just another picture of the nodule near the stomach/upper small bowel. You can also see the right colon, and the low signal fluid around the liver and spleen.

8. [Axial diffusion weighted image](http://imgur.com/FBOVwRG): Okay, so what is diffusion. Well, normally, water molecules are free to move around in the extracellular space. When you have something that causes swelling (edema is the fancy word), there is not only more water present, but it's also usually jammed into the cells in the area, and therefore less able to move around. So when we send in those radio pulses and then listen for the echo, water that can't move keeps getting more and more energy, and so the signal is higher. Water that gets hit by the radiowave but then moves out of the spot we're listening to will have low signal. So it's helpful to identify true swelling/edema. This image is at the level of the right colon. All of the high signal in the right colon is abnormal, and we know it's not just T2 shine-through because the same area is also dark on the ADC map (T2 shine-through is bright on both).

9. [Axial ADC map](http://imgur.com/upjTXi1): Just to confirm the diffusion restriction. If you don't understand the whole DWI-ADC map relationship, that's okay. It doesn't really matter for the story.

Well, the biopsy results finally come back. The differential diagnosis for the way the stuff looked under the microscope is read by the pathologists as, ""florid mesothelial hyperplasia versus peritoneal mesothelioma."" I looked all of this crap up about 15 seconds after I got the phone call from the GI fellow with the results. I had never even heard of it, and I'm a freaking doctor. When you say, ""mesothelioma,"" everyone thinks (1) asbestos exposure and (2) it's a lung cancer (technically, it's a cancer of the lining of the lung, but that's semantics).

When taken in conjunction with the MRI findings, this is highly concerning for malignant peritoneal mesothelioma. But they still weren't 100% sure, so we had to stick some cameras in my belly to take a look. They did that and took a bunch of samples. They were also doing it to see how much disease was in there (I mean, look at those pictures. There's some really fucked up shit going on inside me). 

We didn't think I was a surgical candidate when all of this started. People who can't get the surgery and the cancer removed have an abysmal prognosis. Like, 6-18 months type of prognosis. Well fuck. 

They have a system to estimate the extent of disease, called the [peritoneal carcinomatosis index](http://www.surgicaloncology.com/gpmindic.htm). It's a scale that goes from 0 to 39, and the bigger the number the worse it is. Based on the MRI , my index was 31/39. Almost all of the published literature and studies on this shows that patients above a PCI of ~12-13 don't do well. The final tissue diagnosis is malignant peritoneal mesothelioma, epitheliod subtype. 

As luck would have it, there happens to be a team of oncologists where I'm training, both surgical and medical, that specializes in cancers that have spread to the abdominal surface. The team decided to try a two-step surgical approach, that was developed at Columbia in NYC, which has taken people with really bad disease and made their outcomes similar to those of people with lower PCIs. The general idea is this: get the worst of it out with a first debulking surgery. If there's anything there that's going to make the surgery really hard, or force the surgeon to remove an entire organ that they really kind of don't want to take out, they leave it. After the surgery, you do chemotherapy in the abdomen, and then later you go back in for a final surgery where the goal is to take out everything they see. With both of the surgeries, too, they do something called heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). The idea is that, you can physically remove the bulky disease you can see, but there are probably microscopic cancer cells you gotta kill too. That's what the HIPEC is supposed to do.

So, we go to surgery. They took out my spleen, distal pancreas, gallbladder, right and transverse portions of my colon, all of the omentum (stuff that covers the bowel), and a bunch of the lining along my diaphragms (the muscles that move your lungs) and throughout the belly. It took them 12 hours to do the first surgery and HIPEC. Obviously, this is a huge ordeal and I'm in the intensive care unit for the first few days after surgery and everything hurts like a motherfucker. I learned during that hospitalization that Dilaudid is my homie. I don't know how I would have tolerated the pain without a drug that's basically as powerful as heroin. Also, I'm pretty sure I know how it feels to do heroin, so, thanks for that too, cancer.

They used cisplatin for the HIPEC procedure, and that drug is well-known for being very effective, but also for having the potential to trash your kidneys. I still to this day don't know exactly how this happened, but instead of getting just a dose to the inside of my abdomen and a *tiny* bit absorbed by the rest of my body, I get a *fuckton* absorbed by the rest of my body, and it pissed off my kidneys somethin' *fierce,* as we say in the south.

I went into acute kidney failure. They hoped that the injury would hit the peak of its badness and then I'd start to get better and my kidneys will start working again. It doesn't happen. After 4 days of continually worsening renal function, they decide I need dialysis. So we go down to interventional radiology (aka, IR) and they put a [tunneled line exactly like this](https://www.healthqare.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/vascularaccess-300x275.jpg) into my chest and right sided neck vein. The medical term is a ""right internal jugular central venous catheter."" To translate from ""doctor"" to ""normal English speech,"" you need a big honkin' hose to be able to move enough blood to do dialysis. I ended up being in the hospital for about 10 days all together.

I figured I'd be on dialysis for a few days. Not a good event to have happen, obviously, but ultimately no big deal. Nope, it was way worse than that. I had to be dialized 5 days in a row in the hospital, and then we started doing it ""only"" three times a week. Even after I was discharged, I was on dialysis for two months until my kidneys recovered enough on their own that things like my electrolyte levels weren't getting out of whack anymore. You can die from fatal heart rhythms from having too much potassium in your body, for instance. 

Another fun complication I had with all of this was a big ass clot where the catheter was in my vein. This happened maybe 4 days after I was discharged. It shouldn't have been a surprise, really. When you start listing the risk factors for blood clots, I had almost all of them: cancer, recent surgery, immobility, indwelling foreign device. My right arm felt tight all day, and then I looked in the mirror and noticed that the right side of my face was swollen. That little spot behind your collar bone where the skin kinda dips down was completely gone. It was puffed out the other way, actually. When I went to the ER, it was such a slam dunk diagnosis that they didn't even bother doing anything except starting me on blood thinners.

When you have blood clots like that, you can't wait around for the oral blood thinners to kick in. You have to start people on blood thinners that work right away, most often heparin. Doctors call this ""bridging"" someone. The thing that sucks about heparin is that there's no one dose that's great for everyone. You have to give it to people and then check a lab value related to clotting times (the PTT), and adjust the rate of heparin accordingly until you get the person to ""their"" dose. So basically you gotta get stuck a lot so they can test your blood.

I already have a one in a million cancer, but I also found out that day that heparin doesn't work on me. They kept giving me more and more and checking the labs all the time and they didn't budge, so they had to use a newer, way more expensive drug, and I was going to be in the hospital being ""bridged"" to the oral blood thinner (warfarin aka Coumadin). You can't safely discharge people until the warfarin is at a therapeutic level, so once again I was sitting in the hospital just waiting. Waiting for one freaking number to be above 2. 

It took 6 days in the hospital to get there. The hospital is boring as fuck. The food sucks. You see your doctors for 3 minutes a day and then never again until the next day. They talk about you outside your room before they come in, and you can hear them. It was especially annoying for me, because I understood all the things they were talking about. Why wasn't I included in the discussion? I'm both the patient in question *and* a doctor.  

Though, you get demoted real fucking fast when you put on that hospital gown. If you have any kind of title you worked hard for, and are proud of - things like captain, reverend, colonel, doctor, professor - and prefer to be addressed by, well, get used to ""mister."" All of the sudden, I was a ""mister."" Nurse practitioners fresh out of school (I'm 9 years down the medical education rabbit hole at this point) with less clinical experience than a third year medical student were calling me ""mister."" It was then that I realized I had truly become ""the patient.""

But, time's arrow moved, as it does, ever forward, and I finally got out of the hospital. I wasn't out of the hospital (for the second time) for more than a day or two before the next fun complication reared its head. There was a spot in my surgical wound which had always been little firmer than the rest of the tissue. Something wasn't quite right about it, but it looked okay and I didn't have any symptoms. But, on that day, I noticed that my shirt was soaked, and something didn't smell particularly good. The dressing of the wound was also soaked. I took it off to look at the wound, and it was pretty clear that it was infected. 

We went *back* to the hospital. The surgery resident came and saw me. With big gross infected wounds like that, you can't just sew it back up. It will almost certainly get infected and form an abscess if you do that. No, open wounds have to heal by what doctors call ""secondary intention"" or, as I prefer to say, from the bottom up. You have to keep it open and let the tissue fill into the gap. But obviously you also want to clean it so it doesn't get infected again, so you shove wet gauze into it, let it try, then take it out and then repeat the process until it's healed. This is a ""wet-to-dry"" dressing, and every time you take it out, it removes some of the nasty crap from the wound and leaves only the good ""beefy red"" granulation tissue (what a delightful description, no?) .

When I say it was big and gross, it was. Actually, I'm a weird guy (duh, radiologist) so I took pictures of it as it healed. [This is what it looked like the day after we opened it up in the office](https://i.imgur.com/1hPeaxU.jpg). My only regret is that I forgot to include a banana for scale. But, that smaller hole down inside the big hole is actually an opening right into the abdominal cavity. I could have stuck my finger down through that thing and touched my own intestines. I didn't, because that seems gross and also like a pretty bad idea, but I *could* have. It took this bad-boy about a month to heal up.

Also, with the open wound on my belly, and the dialysis catheter dangling out of the right side of my chest, I basically couldn't take a shower. I would sit on the edge of the tub and wash the important bits (you know what I'm talking about) and try to keep everything else as dry as possible. I don't know about you, but a nice shower in the morning is one of those small pleasures in life (right up there with the pee shivers after holding it in forever). 

And sometimes, you don't appreciate things until they're gone. I sure as shit didn't appreciate things like, ""not being in pain all the time"" or ""not throwing up bile every day because you actually still have your gallbladder."" And, quite frankly, my previous good health. I took it as a given. I was only 32 when I was diagnosed. I'm not supposed to have any serious medical problems at that age. Certainly not something life-threatening. And *certainly* not something that's as likely, on a statistical level, as it is to [have a major earthquake on the Hayward fault within the next 50 minutes and other rare things that almost certainly won't happen](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/Real-World/million.html). This is not a go-to diagnosis. This is a, ""what the actual fuck"" diagnosis.

===============

I finally thought I was doing better. I felt better. It was 3 months out from the surgery, and my wound had finally closed and I was finally able to eat okay and get calories in me and gain weight. I lost about 25 lbs from this ordeal and to this day I still find it very difficult to eat more than a small meal and put on weight. The silver lining, and perhaps something people might envy, is that I can eat whatever the hell I want and still look pretty good. I eat a ton of garbage food now in an attempt to gain weight. My last 3 dinners have been domino's, taco bell, and wendy's, for example.  I'm scared I'm going to lose a bunch of weight again and look like nothing but skin and bones after the next surgery.

But the fun wasn't over yet! Remember how I said we were gonna do intra-abdominal chemo between surgeries? Well, we had started that at this point, and the way we were getting it into the belly was through what we call ""ports."" You may have heard about those before. They're usually used to have permanent, long term IV access in a safe way. They have a long tube that goes basically wherever you want it (vein, belly, whatever) connected to a hub or reservoir that they access with a needle, put in whatever med you're using, and then take the needle out. The reservoir is placed under the skin so they don't get infected (you access them with sterile technique). [1 picture == 1000 words](http://img.medicalexpo.com/images_me/photo-g/69647-9309172.jpg).

Anyway, we placed two, initially. What were the odds that both would fail? Well, as you may be picking up by now, I'm one lucky motherfucker, because the one that was on the left side just stopped working and really hurt when they would attempt to flush it out with saline. So we stopped using that one. On the right, the stitches holding the reservoir failed, and the port started moving under the skin. Actually, it started tilting forward and pressing out on the skin. It actually really hurt. 

One advantage I do have with all this is that I have better access to my doctors than the average bear. I have their work email addresses and pager numbers. So I got in touch and met up with my surgical oncologist. We both looked at it and agreed it needed to be revised, but it was a Friday evening when this took place. We planned on doing it early the next week. Instead, [it eroded through the skin the next day](http://i.imgur.com/lSndrhD.jpg). I got to enjoy that over the weekend.

And as you might imagine, once that happens it has to come out. And I had no access for the chemo I was supposed to get. So we went back to IR, took out both of the failed ports, and through something of a minor miracle, they were able to successfully place an intra-abdominal port in IR. All of us were skeptical it would work. One thing that happens after just about any belly surgery is that you get scar tissue in the belly. We call them adhesions. They prevent things from moving around as easily as they should, and can sometimes even cause bowel obstructions in people. One of the more common general surgery procedures, actually, is ""lysis of adhesions"" - they break up the adhesions from a prior surgery if they have to go back in for some reason. But the IR doc was able to sneak the catheter past all of that stuff and got it into position.

===========

And that's basically where we're at. The most recent port problem happened about a month ago. I had to pack that one, too, but it was a lot smaller than the big wound and healed up in about 3 weeks. This thing really knocked me on my ass at a really inopportune time in my life. My now-wife and I had just gotten engaged on New Year's Eve, and I was diagnosed in early March of this year. I actually asked her if she was sure she wanted to ""stay in the game"" with me, so to speak. I would have understood if the answer was no. Truly I would have. This is fucking up her life almost as much as mine, at this point. But, and this is why I locked that shit down ASAP, my wife is the most amazing person I know. She told me to stop being a ridiculous idiot and that our wedding date was already set, so I'd better get to planning. 

She is without question the love of my life.

Anyway, here are some fun stats you might not know about malignant peritoneal mesothelioma: it exists. The incidence is about one in a million. There are about 300 cases of this per year in the US. The average age of diagnosis is about 60. It's not as clearly related to asbestos exposure as the pleural variety. People with high PCIs generally don't do well, but that's often because they're not surgical candidates. The single most important factor for survival is the completeness of cytoreduction - if they can get all the disease out, people do better. You can go from a PCI of 39 to 0 with a good surgery.

The epitheliod subtype has the best outcomes (outside of an even more rare cystic variant which is almost always seen in women). There's also a sarcomatous variety and a mixed type, both of which do worse.

===============


I have to take the radiology boards in November and then we go right back to surgery after that. It's unclear if I get to keep my stomach; I'll find out what they had to do to get rid of all the disease only after I wake up in the ICU. The thing that scares me the most about the next surgery is the possibility of another severe kidney injury which would probably put me on permanent dialysis. I'm now chronic kidney disease stage III (V is dialysis dependent, so I'm a bit over halfway there!). But I don't really have any underlying risk factors that would continue to degrade my kidney function, so I could do okay for a long time like that without another huge insult. Again, only time will tell. Feeling out of control of your life is very frustrating and scary, particularly for people like doctors who all think we're in total control of everything in life. Protip: we're not. 

After the second surgery, I should be at a cytoreduction score of 0, meaning they got everything out. At least, that's the plan. After that, they want to do more chemo, but this time intravenous/system with a platinum based drug and pemetrexed, a derivative of methotrexate, and the only medicine FDA approved for mesothelioma. 

One of the most famous guys in this field, Dr. Sugarbaker (the one in DC, not MD Anderson) put a series of 29 patients on a protocol of cytoreductive surgery, early post-operative intra-abdominal chemo, and then 6 cycles of cisplatin + long term intra-abdominal alimta. They're projecting their 10 year survival in those patients to be as high as 73%. I'm going to push my team to go in the same direction, if they'll offer that therapy to me. 

It may sound stupidly optimistic, but I think I actually have a shot at a very good outcome. And I also think this has made me a better/more empathetic doctor. I understand now what patients go through. Little things matter to them/us. It's nice when people go out of their way to make sure your scan and your appointment are on the same day, for instance. It's even more important when you're talking to patients who drive 1-2 hours (or more) just to get to the hospital. They really appreciate stuff like that. 

I learned that I need to go out of my way to introduce myself to people *before* you do a procedure on them. In a training hospital, often, the lower level residents go do the pre-procedure paperwork and the upper level residents just operate or do cases all day. Someone you have never met, whose name you don't know, may be sticking their hand (or at least a wire) into your body while you're unconscious. I met the surgical oncology fellow, for instance, as I was counting backwards from 10 falling asleep from the anesthesia. You know, that monstrous, 12 hour beast of a case that this whole thing has been about. In my head, I went, ""Whatt thhhhhheeee fuuuuu [out]."" I will never do a case on someone who doesn't know my name, and whose hand haven't shaken (well, unless the patient doesn't want to shake my hand).

I went into radiology specifically to do interventional radiology, but now I'm absolutely chomping at the bit to get back into the clinical world. I want to drop TACE and Y-90 beads (procedures to treat cancer that has started in or spread to the liver) into all kinds of bad things for people so they can give cancer the big ""fuck you."" I want to actively do things to help patients, like, all the time now. Not that I was a complete dick before or anything, but after this kind of experience, you just ""get it.""

Lastly, it also taught me that there's no time like the present to start living your life. I got married to the love of my life a couple weeks ago and we just got back from a super-kickass honeymoon. I plan on continuing to do awesome things with the people who matter until I literally can't get out of bed. 

Fuck cancer, and ask me anything!

(And [now I will shamelessly plug my scuba diving footage from the aforementioned honeymoon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb3OASSR3pg), just like those professors who put the pictures they took on vacation in their powerpoints. I actually worked really hard on it, so please check it out my friends!)

"Hey man, I'm Tommy Chong, 1/2 of Cheech & Chong & 77-year-old actor, director, activist, musician, who also occasionally smokes a little bit of pot...AMA!",19033,3xvxn1,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3xvxn1/hey_man_im_tommy_chong_12_of_cheech_chong/,3750,1450850300.0,"Let me tell you guys first off that I’ve been the victim of a death hoax this week (see:http://imgur.com/pw97uga).   I want to let you know that this is actually me and not my stoned ghost (see:http://imgur.com/gpVpsZJ ).  I’m not actually dead!  Woohoo!!   

Cheech & Chong consist of myself and my comedy partner Cheech Marin.  We released albums, movies and toured the country in the ‘70s and ‘80s.  Our most famous movie without a doubt that people recognize us for to this day is “Up In Smoke.”  The reaction to “Up In Smoke” was incredible and it is a movie I am most proud of.  I directed Up In Smoke, Cheech & Chong’s Next Movie, Nice Dreams, Still Smoking, Far Out Man and The Corsican Brothers.  We have been credited as pioneers of the legalization of marijuana and the popularizers of cannabis in pop culture. 

Something you may not know about me is that I was also in a band signed to Motown prior to being part of Cheech & Chong and we had a hit record and even played with the Jackson 5 once before they were famous called Bobby Taylor & The Vancouvers.  

Recently I’ve been working in my shed a lot making pipes and art in my house in the Pacific Palisades in Los Angeles.  I have been out of jail for over a decade after being incarcerated in 2003 as part of Operation Pipe Dreams for the selling of bongs.  I was on Dancing With The Stars a year ago, which was really fun.  I made a web talk show over the summer and I'm going to be making more videos.  Cheech & I are still very good friends.  2015 and the near future is almost like the completion of this plot arc of a movie I've been playing a character in my entire life and I am now seeing the dream of full cannabis legalization, actually come true.  It's amazing and we have truly come a long way.

That being said, I want to make sure you know man that I am going to give you no filters here Reddit, you’re going to have to take my answers harsh and uncut.  Feel free to ask me anything, let’s start this AMA man.

I'm on social media on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook.  Instagram:  @heytommychong, Twitter: @tommychong, Facebook: you can figure it out.

Some background about me: I'm a 24 year old software developer in Research Triangle Park, NC. I founded Speak Together a year ago to build software to change the models citizens can use to reach out to their govt. 

last year I got involved in the fight to repeal NC HB2 (the notorious anti-transgender bathroom law that was passed here in North Carolina) and quickly became jaded by how difficult and inefficient it was to learn about the activities of the state legislature and communicate at all with my representatives. 

I found a few friends who had felt the same way as me, and we've been building software to try to make that process easier. One of them, violetnekos, is also on the ama.

At the time, I was in the middle of trying to fund a book I was writing and redditors contributed about 10% of that.  I’m not trying to sell the book, and I’m not even going to tell you where it is sold.  That’s not why I’m here.

The book is free to redditors:  [Edit 7: Links have been removed, but please feel free to PM me if you're late to this and didn't get to download it.]

Hi, this is Sean Evans and Chris Schonberger, host and creator (respectively) of the hit YouTube series Hot Ones, and we're back on Reddit to answer your spicy questions. 

The concept of our show is simple: We interview celebrities while making them eat a series of increasingly hot chicken wings. Through eight seasons and more than 160 episodes, we've had guests like [Gordon Ramsay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9DyHthJ6LA), [Scarlett Johansson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR5kfWXfxto), and [Ken Jeong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WQHDUYk310) take on the wings of death. 

You can catch new episodes on Thursdays, 11am ET on [First We Feast's YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPD_bxCRGpmmeQcbe2kpPaA)—the Season 9 premiere is coming May 23. We're here to answer YOUR hot questions! We won't be eating wings (we are eating pizza though).

 And if you're into the show, check out this subreddit /r/hotones (s/o [Alex](https://www.instagram.com/alexander.rockefeller/) for helping setup this AMA!)

EDIT: Chris and I are going to grab a couple of Old Fashioneds and settle in for this Raptors x Sixers game. Thanks so much for all the great questions - these things are always a lot of fun. Hot Ones returns May 23 and we have the S9 hot sauce reveal coming out next week. Upvote the other questions you want answered because we're going to hop in here tomorrow morning for an hour or so.

Two years ago I quit my job and started a business that I grew to 7-figures in revenue from my apartment. AMA!,18639,61n0f9,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/61n0f9/two_years_ago_i_quit_my_job_and_started_a/,2270,1490581085.0,"Hi Reddit! My name is Roger and in May of 2015, inspired by a trip to a grocery store in China, I decided to start an online business to sell international snacks! Treats delivers a box of snacks from a different country around the world each month straight to your door! The moment of epiphany occurred when I purchased a Choco Pie (it's a Korea chocolate coated marshmallow snack), a snack that loved as a kid, and I remembered thinking “It's a real shame most people from outside of Asia will never have a chance to try this.”

At this point in time I’d recently quit my job to pursue my dreams of starting a business, so when I got the idea I dove right in. I went to the local ethnic markets around me and bought all the snacks I could find in order to determine if I actually enjoyed eating snacks from other countries. To my relief I did! And with that, it was off to the races. Over a period of three months, from the living room of my apartment (and with about $5000 in savings), I built a website, found a warehouse, and laid the groundwork for the launch of the company. At the end of July 2015 the website was live and the company officially in business!

The business has since grown exponentially and it’s been an exhilarating experience throughout. During the first six months I felt like I was in a constant fight for survival - to build the company, launch it, and grow fast enough before I ran out of money. To maximize the amount of cash that could put in the business, I put all my personal expenses on my credit card, racking up thousands in debt. I also took on personal and business loans to keep the company afloat as it was growing. 

Throughout this entire process, I made a ton of mistakes and learned a lot of lessons, and I’d love to answer any questions you might have about my experiences, business, snacks, or anything! AMA 😃

A few years later, I got out of that business, and started up my own game company, which has a title on Kickstarter right now.

I truly love what this plant stands for and what it has the potential to do for humanity on a medicinal/agricultural/humanistic level. So I made it part of my mission to de-stigmatize this plant.  In my mind there’s only a few things that unite the world not matter what color/sex/race/religion/etc- Love Fear, Food and Music. So here I am, tryin to do some good in this world. 

Here’s some cool stuff I’ve been able to do over the years:

- Was called last minute and cooked on Viceland for Bong Apatite 
- cooked for famous people
- Cooked with Juicy J in my tiny ass apartment

- Was on CNN, Forbes, Fox News, The Guardian, Reuters, AFP, Fast Times, GQ, Elle Magazine, and many more talking about Cannabis
- I went cliff jumping and cracked my tooth 
- Speak at the National Restaurant Association annually
- Speak at ACF Chefs, Catersource, New England Food Expo, and more about Culinary Cannabis 
- u/here_comes_the_king shared my YouTube video once (I still have yet to cook for him)

Edit #2: 
I have to say, Reddit, It’s got me a little emotional to see how many people are thinking about others in this thread.  A lot of you really want to see something done for the people wrongfully incarcerated with non-violent marijuana charges, a lot want to see patients being helped, and a lot want to see education become more widely available.  I love this.  It’s why I jumped into this and left UCSC.  I knew that this plant would be able to help with these societal issues.  Systematic issues even.  

If I could just say one thing, it would be that I am trying so damn hard to do something positive.  I didn’t have big business experience prior to this endeavor, every day that my company grows, I am in a whole shitstorm of “idk what the fuck to do” and learning every step of the way. While trying to be an activist i still have to consider how to pay my bills, try and be normal and social, and see family. I am just one person and we have a very small team, but I can promise you this.  I am relentless in my efforts to make a more positive, healthier, open world. I hope you can understand that I don’t have all the answers, but I am working towards it all. 


So much love to all of you. 


I’ll be answering questions throughout the day still as my time permits, but I wanted to say THANK YOU for what has been an incredibly insightful and moving experience. 


Edit#3. TL;DR 
- We are not all about getting high, we believe in the plant is multifaceted in its uses. 

- We serve a 10 course menu with 10mgTHC over the course of the evening along with 6-8oz of wine to create a feeling of euphoria without being overwhelmed. 

- We believe that you should wait until your brain is more fully developed before using cannabis, this is highly debated and I can’t really give a year or age although it seems 18-25years is when the prefrontal cortex is fully developed (http://mentalhealthdaily.com/2015/02/18/at-what-age-is-the-brain-fully-developed/)

IamA Pharma company CEO whose drug just helped save the life of the 4th person in America to ever Survive the Brain Eating Amoeba- a 97% fatal disease. AMA!,18371,4zdc5a,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4zdc5a/iama_pharma_company_ceo_whose_drug_just_helped/,2469,1472083684.0,"**My short bio:** My name is Todd MacLaughlan and I am the CEO and founder of Profounda, Inc. an entrepreneurial private venture backed pharmaceutical company. I Have over 30 years’ experience in the Pharmaceutical Industry and have worked at larger companies such as Bayer, Novartis, Watson, Cardinal Health, and Allergan before starting my own pharmaceutical Company. Currently we have two Product ventures Impavido (miltefosine)- the drug I’m here to talk to you about, and Rhinase nasal products. If you have any questions about my experience ask away, but I'm sure you are more interested in the Brain Eating Amoeba, and I am interested in Spreading awareness so let me dive right into that!

Naegleria fowleri (commonly known as the “Brain eating Amoeba”) causes a brain infection called Primary Amebic Meningoencephalitis (PAM) that is almost always fatal (97%). In the United States only three people had ever survived PAM. Two of them were on Miltefosine, our newly acquired drug (It’s FDA indication is for the treatment of Leishmaniasis- a rare tropical disease). Sebastian Deleon marks the 4th survivor and the 3rd on our medication.

We work closely with Jeremy Lewis from the Kyle Cares Organization (http://www.kylelewisamoebaawareness.org/) and Steve Smelski of the Jordan Smelski Foundation for Amoeba Awareness Stephen (http://www.jordansmelskifoundation.org/). Please check them out and learn more!

Profounda has started a consignment program for Impavido (miltefosine) and hospitals. We offer Impavido to be stocked free of charge in any hospital, accepting payment only once the drug is used. We also offer to replace any expired drug at no charge. When minutes count, we want the drug on hand instead of sitting in a warehouse. In the past, the drug was kept on hand by the CDC in Atlanta and flown out when it was needed. In the case of Jordan Smelski who was a Patient in Orlando, it took 10 hours for the drug to reach him. He passed away 2 hours before the drug reached the hospital. We want to get this into as many Hospitals as we can across the country so that no one has to wait hours again for this lifesaving treatment. 

So far only 6 hospitals have taken us up on the offer.

Anyways, while I can go on and on, that’s already a lot of Information so please feel free to AMA!

My name is Eric Sanders (although I was originally called Ignaz Schwarz) and I was born in Vienna in 1919. 

As a Jew I escaped the Nazis and headed to London where I luckily arrived in 1938. I joined the British Army and eventually the SOE (Special Operations Executive). Since the end of the war I have written several plays and a script for the film 'Nasser' along with two autobiographies (one in German and the other in English) and have now turned my eye, at the wonderfully ripe age of 97, towards writing books.

I have just finished writing a two part book called Mazes (blurb here: https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71VR4-JXffL.jpg) and I will also be holding a book launch event at the BAFTA venue on Saturday 16th September, feel free to PM me if you are interested in attending!

The internet should remain open and equal for all. Sonic will continue to do everything it can to stand up for net neutrality, whether the regulations require it or not.

Suddenly, the conveyor belt started up and I went on a ride that changed my life forever.

I spent 16 days in the hospital where doctor's focused on placing a rod and screws into my left arm (which the rod and screws eventually became infected with MRSA and had to be removed out of the arm) and to apply skin grafts to areas where I had 3rd degree burns from the friction of the belt.

To date, I have had 12 surgeries with more in the future mostly to repair my left arm and 3rd degree burns from the friction of the belts.

The list of injuries include:

*Broken humerus 
*5 shattered ribs 
*3rd degree burns on right shoulder & left elbow 
*3 broken vertebrae 
*Collapsed lung 
*Nerve damage in left arm resulting in 4 month paralysis 
*PTSD
*Torn rotator cuff 
*Torn bicep tendon 
*Prominent arthritis in left shoulder

Here are some photos of the conveyor belt:

The one I was sitting on when it was turned on: https://i.imgur.com/4aGV5Y2.jpg

I was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in July of 2015, and classified Stage IV in October of that year. I underwent a distal pancratectomy and splenectomy followed by chemotherapy and radiation (with more chemo) over the following 18 months. I had no evidence of disease from January 2016 to April of 2018, when a recurrence was found on my liver. In September I had a liver resection and have been doing more chemo to try and wrap things up, and things seem to be going alright.

Through my journey I've tried adjunctive therapies which I feel were helpful with symptoms if nothing else. I've also worked hard to ease my fear of death and physical disability. I'm happy to talk about most anything! So please feel free to ask.

*Why? Are you raising money for anything? Any charity?*

* My motivation was the adventure. There was no cause associated. I wasn't raising awareness or money for anything. At first I felt a little guilty when people would ask me, but I learned to own it. I was doing it because it was there. To see if I could. Humans have an innate desire to explore and adventure and that's what I was tapping into more than anything. After I started thinking about it, I got worried that one day I'd regret it if I didn't do it. The idea of watching the country evolve ever slowly as I moved eastward at 3 mph, *that* excited me.

I was collegehumor.com's first writer, and last baseball season I was the senior comedy correspondent for Fox Sports. I have done a bunch of TV shows and just filmed a part in my second movie. And I'm the host of [Major League Podcast](http://www.MajorLeaguePodcast.com), where I ask professional baseball players uncomfortable questions like ""What's it like to be traded for a player to be named later?"".

I tour as much as I can, and I produce comedy shows around the states. [Here's free tickets](http://www.comedysupply.com). 

If you want to know what my comedy is like, I have [my latest special on YouTube for free.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9ByX-oJAM)

IamA Disabled Little Person who just moved into an apt of my own!!! Wooo! Let's have some fun. AMA!,17898,7yp3nr,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/7yp3nr/iama_disabled_little_person_who_just_moved_into/,1982,1519095801.0,"**My short bio:** I did an AMA 2 or 3 years ago which made it to the front page, because we just had fun with it. I was answering for 2 solid days and don't let my photo fool you with the size of my brass cojones, I am actually a little person. Sorry no banana for scale. I am diagnosed technically with rheumatoid arthritis which screwed up my joints pretty badly for many years before biologics like Enbrel went mainstream. I am 34 and got ""sick"" at 3, so in 1986. I am not touchy about answering anything health related or my condition or the occasional inevitable ""how big is your dick?"" questions. Lets have fun. 

Sorry about the quality of my photos, my phone is a potato.

https://imgur.com/a/Mc6p7 Short album of my apt and a hilarious shot of my with a stripper. I was laughing like a moron the entire time because of the awkwardness and ridiculousness of the situation, not because of her nakedness. The Strip club was actually super disappointing. Dark, very loud, most of it wasn't accessible, and the dancing was crap. I could dance better, and it crossed my mind actually getting up on stage. Ask for a ramp and there I am twerking my powerchair's ass off.

Now the problem why I moved on my own into an accessible apt was not only the accessibility which I never had before (I couldn't reach the sink, go outside on my own til I got this incredible powerchair a couple years ago, didn't have an accessible shower, or kitchen, etc) but also because of my parents, particularly my mother. A few years ago I started reading /r/raisedbynarcissists and after years of depression, isolation, tantrums, and a suicide attempt, I found that those stories read exactly like my life. So maybe the problem wasn't in me and I wasn't to blame. Next step was doing something about it. It took years of exercising my arms, anxiety chest pains, weed, months of bureaucracy, and fighting and loathing for me to find this place. Obviously I have a visiting aide, Deb, but the idea here is to do as much as I can on my own. Deb's a hoot though. I was afraid of getting someone with the outlook of a guard from Auschwitz. I was also lucky in that the installer guy agreed to make slight modifications to the apt for my safety, but I went balls deep with the expensive grab bars and touch sensitive Delta faucet (I'm sure you can imagine how much that cost). A few kind Redditors took pity and actually bought me a mechanical toothbrush and gummi bears. I can eat a pound of those when I'm stoned.

Now I will tell you a little bit about the apt. It isn't big, in fact it's quite small, the bedroom is about filled to the brim after the bed was installed. But it's 100% mine and to make it livable I have then, and now planned to make as much of it accessible or automatic as possible. They already have a remote control door which I actually was pleasantly surprised by, and motion sensors on trash and laundry rooms. But inside the apt I had ideas in my head too... Keep in mind I really can't modify the apt, nail things to walls or whatever, but they were kind enough to agree to install my mostly reasonable safety requests. For example I spent a lot of money on a touch sensor faucet. Sorry for the potato quality photo, but I cannot take good selfies with my tiny little Trex arms. I wanted to show the kitchen faucet here. Basically not only can I reach it (a first for me) but it's also very convenient in that you touch any metal part to turn it on/off. The soap dispense is motion sensitive too (though it leaves a lot to be desired as it sucks the soap back as much as it squirts out). The bathroom sink faucet will be motion sensitive and they installed safety for my toilet too  https://i.imgur.com/SlWNY25.jpg and what I lovingly call my Hello Kitty seat https://i.imgur.com/rt0TMce.jpg The trashcans will be motion sensitive and will close because I don't want to be staring at rubbish all day. A very kind Redditor has purchased an Alexa for me which is incredible because not only will I have something smarter than a cat to talk to, I can also ask it to call 911 if I fell on my head and I don't even need one of those emergency buttons. As far as lighting goes, I don't have good ideas. I know I can't nail things to walls, and those stand alone lights piss me off. To me they're like for old people. My crazy idea was to RGB the entire place with hidden Alexa controlled lightstrips. For one I can stick these under bed and have the first ever RGB bed in history (eat your heart out, Corsair), behind couch under my PC table without damaging walls. The wirelessness will be convenient and they will provide light as well as color if I want. This feels like the way to go, but so far I haven't been able to choose a good lightstrip system, and I really don't know how many I will need. Probably at least 4 or 5 strips but I will come up with a plan once I have everything else under control.

Now for the medical part if anyone has questions. I have rheumatoid arthritis since I was 3 as I said, which is autoimmune meaning my immune system is attacking my joints. Unfortunately in Russia in 1986 there wasn't really any way to fight this, most of the meds were had to be self-purchased somewhere. I had Gold from Japan which my grandmother bought. Yes these were used to treat inflammation way back when. I stayed though drastically decreased, the amount or prednisone I take daily all this time. As you can imagine prednisone comes with horrible side effects. Cataract, blood pressure, stomach ulcer, head aches, etc. I used to retain more water than three pregnant women. In about 1999-2000 I started having compression spinal fractures about once or more a month for about 2 years because my body had finally had enough and the osteoporosis is one of the major prednisone side effects. I lost a ton of weight and could eat or even sit up for that matter. I was in pretty much the worst pain you can imagine. Depression set in hard and is still around. Somehow I willed myself to sit up, start eating, and excersising to the limited way I can. Then out of the blue in 2009 I had what was later to be found a mass in my throat so I could barely swallow and even had trouble breathing. Thankfully I found an amazing surgeon in Jefferson, Dr. Boon, who worked his magic and brought me out of it. Got all the nasty out but it took a nightmarish week of precautions, feeding tube, and scoping my throat and two surgeries (was so pretty inside they went in again just for the hell of it.)

I later said I had enough. I got a powerchair, and got the fuck out of that nightmarish hole while the getting was good. I was lucky enough to find an apt and a good visiting aide. My eventual dream is a van like in that album which is a conversion with a ramp so you can sit in the front in your powerchair and drive it. But alas these things are not cheap. I'd be 300 by the time I could afford one. http://imgur.com/gallery/Fq22A

The surgery was now 3 weeks ago and I'm still in the hospital fighting my body against rejection of my new liver. The docs say this is common in younger people because their immune systems are stronger and my body is trying to get rid of this 'foreign object'. 

Im taking massive doses of steroids and immunosuppressants to get my body to accept the new organ but it's a long process. Been at it for 3 weeks now and while my body is coming around, I'll probably be here another week or so.

Keep me company! Ask me anything!

The 30 chapters of the deal were officially released a few months ago and it confirmed our fears that this agreement would have longstanding consequences for our digital rights, health, environment, and democracy.  


Although the signing ceremony was really just a formality—for the agreement to go into force, the countries involved still need to ratify the agreement. Each of the twelve TPP countries have differing procedures for doing this, but in the U.S., both houses of Congress needs to vote up or down on the agreement. Although the issues we will be discussing will impact everyone in the countries involved in the TPP, it's especially critical that people in the U.S. learn all they can about this secretive agreement and call on their representatives to vote no to its ratification. That's because the agreement cannot go into force without the United States' legislative approval. 


So we're here today to answer your questions about everything TPP—the secret negotiating process, our analysis of the provisions, and how this agreement is a corporate wish list for big multinational companies. We're here to share what we know about this agreement so you can help us stop it.

**EDIT** Lots of questions about my comment on the rights of workers to run for office.  I won't comment on my company policy but I can say I absolutely felt that I was going to get fired for running for office.  I voluntarily asked permission, and that took over one month.  I finally had enough and by the time it reached that point the wheels had been turning for my Congressional race.  I decided that I would rather stand for my belief than worry about my job.  I don't want special protection, or leave (though many companies do this).  I don't want a guaranteed job if I lose my seat.  I just don't believe you should be afraid to run for office in your free time because you could get fired. I absolutely felt that way.  In many states this is legal, and it does happen.  

You should not have to worry about serving your community.  You shouldn't have to ask for permission to **run** for office.  Holding office is a different story.   

****Ok that is a wrap***** Thank you so much! That was a blast!  One last example of corruption in politics before I go: 

https://imgur.com/a/BOYw3

This is an email to state delegates in Nevada.  Basically, you sign up to be a delegate, get super excited and then the party sends you an email with an invite and you ""pay"" for your ticket.  You **do not have to pay to vote** and trickery like this is why people hate politics.  Pay to play is terrible, people are tired of it.  

Also...Lots of debate on this in the thread but I stand firm.  You should not be afraid to lose your job if you want to run for office on your own time.  I will fight like hell to make that a nation law.

My personal background:

I’m a millennial father, Native Hawaiian, and third-term state legislator. Growing up, I saw self-serving politicians selling off the rights to our islands, and I knew that change needed to start at home. So at 23, I ran for the State House against a corporate Democrat and a tea-party millionaire incumbent in what was then a Republican district. They outspent me 10-to-1, but I had the people on my side. I won by a whopping 26 percentage points.

And I did it through small donations, organizing volunteers, and personally knocking on 15,000 doors. But getting elected is not enough. Progressives need to fight to create lasting change. During my six years in the legislature, we fought to pass marriage equality, raise the minimum wage, expand the world's largest marine monument, levy stricter gun control, regulate Super Pacs, increase taxes on billionaires and set the nation's first 100% renewable energy goal, and more. Now, I’m taking this energy and record to Congress.

My Congressional campaign is living out the values that mobilized America’s progressive base in 2016--championing Medicare-for-all, tuition-free college, living wages, the right to organize, strike, and bargain, aggressive climate action, a universal job guarantee, gender equity, LGBTQ+ rights, and an end to reckless wars abroad. And, I will do it without a single dollar of corporate PAC or lobbyist money. That’s how you know he’ll never sell out. My values can’t be bought.

Over 2500 small dollar donors have joined our campaign, but we're going to need a lot of help to compete with my corporate opponents. Let's prove that young progressives who think outside the box can bring the change we need.

About me:
I was born in a tiny hamlet in the woods of Poland. My stepfather was the village blacksmith and I learned by observing him. When I was 15, I left the village and went to the nearest city to seek a better life.
I found work as a helper at various smithing shops and finished my high school, then the university. Faced with little job opportunities beyond McDonald's, I decided to start a swordmaking operation of my own.

My company, [AudentiaGuild](http://www.audentia.eu), makes highly embellished swords, armour and other metalwork.

I'm 26 now. Took me some time getting there! 

I also teach sword moves on YouTube - some of you might know me as [The Sword's Path](http://youtube.com/TheSwordsPathChannel). My background as a fencer is mainly in HEMA, but I also trained kendo, kenjutsu and sport fencing.

I've done two AmAs here explaining my face transplant and how happy I am to have been given a second chance at a more normal life, rather than looking like Freddy Kruger the rest of my life.

[2nd one]
(https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4oo6nq/iama_face_transplant_recipient_ama/)

Now comes the negative side of it. While I mentioned before that The Department of Defense covered the cost of the surgery itself and the aftercare at the hospital it was performed at, it was never brought to my attention that any aftercare at any other hospital, was my responsibility. I find it quite hilarious that they would drop a few million into my face, just to put me into thousands of dollars in medical debt later. 

I recently went into rejection in my home state and that's when I found out the harsh reality of it all as seen here 
[Hospital Bill]
(http://imgur.com/w8Ac2sF)

I guess I better start looking into selling one of my testicles, I hear those go for a nice price and I don't need them anyway since medical debt has me by the balls anyway and it will only get worse. 

Ask away at disgruntled face transplant recipient who now feels like a bonafide Guinea Pig to the US Gov.  

$7,000+ may not seem like a lot, but when you were under the impression that everything was going to be covered, it came as quite a shock. Plus it will only get higher as I need labs drawn every month, biopsies taken throughout the year, not to mention rejection of the face typically happens once a year for many face transplant recipients. 

Also here is a website that a lot of my doctors contributed to explaining what facial organ rejection is and also a pic of me in stage 3

EDIT: WHY is the DOD covering face transplants? 

They are covering all face and extremity transplants, most the people in the programs at the various hospitals are civilians. I'm one of the few veterans in the program. I still would have gotten the transplant had I not served. 

These types of surgeries are still experimental, we are pioneering a better future for soldiers and even civilians who may happen to get disfigured or lose a limb, why shouldn't the DoD fully fund their project and the patients involved healthcare when it comes to the experimental surgery. I have personal insurance for all the other bullshit life can throw at me. But I am also taking all the initial risks this new type of procedure has to offer, hopefuly making them safer for the people who may need them one day. You act like I an so ungrateful, yet you have no clue what was discussed in the initial stages. 

Some of you are speaking out of your asses like you know anything about the face and extremity transplant program. 

EDIT #2 I'm not sure why people can't grasp the concept that others and myself are taking all the risks and there are many of them, up to and including death to help medical science and basically pinoneering an amazing procedure. You would think they'd want to keep their investemnts healthy, not mention it's still an experimental surgery. 

I'm nit asking them for free healthcare, but I was expecting them to take care of costs associated to the face transplant. I have insurance to take care of everything else.

And $7k is barely the tip of the iceberg http://fifth.imgur.com/all/  and it will continue to grow.

I have a PhD in human development and a MS in marriage and family therapy. I am also an approved supervisor and a clinical lecturer of psychology at a local university.

My clinical specialty includes working with all types of anxiety, with couples, and with clients who play video games. I also write academically about video gaming's impact on individuals and relationships.

I'm passionate about de-stigmatizing therapy, and about challenging assumptions about therapists. Therapists should be approachable and relatable - after all, we are people too!

**Feel free to ask me anything about therapy, finding resources, mental health, video gaming, or whatever else is on your mind! The views expressed in this AmA are my own and do not represent anything other than my own experience.**

Relatedly - I recently combined my love of video games with my desire to help people find a starting point for accessing mental health resources and support by hosting a Twitch channel titled *\[Game\] Sessions with a Therapist.* Though I cannot ethically provide therapy services on my stream channel, I can (and do) answer general questions, provide general guidance, help find resources, as well as talk about all sorts of things from anxiety to depression to relationship health and more. My goal is to build a community where people can feel supported by me and other viewers, and where they can chat in a space that's more accessible and relatable.

I stream nightly at 11:30pm CDT but also at other random times during the week if I get the time. **If you've ever wanted the opportunity to talk to a therapist in a more casual environment, stop by - I'd love to chat with you!**

Twitch channel: [twitch.tv/drmicklive](https://twitch.tv/drmicklive)

Twitter: [@drmicklive](https://twitter.com/drmicklive)

edit: WOW. This blew up and I am SO grateful that so many are open to talking about this. I'm doing my best to answer questions as fast as I can! Stop by the stream - I'm live right now answering questions verbally as well!

edit 2: this has been absolutely incredible. Seriously. I want to get to every single one of you but you would not believe how swamped my inbox is! be patient with me please! And if you'd like to ask me directly, stop by the stream this evening and every evening at 11:30pm central time! This thread proves that mental health is worth talking about, that it matters, and that having a community and open forum for it is desired and needed!!!

**A final edit: as you can imagine, my inbox is still swamped. It'll take forever for me to respond to each message, so I am going to make this edit to answer a few common-thread questions I've received:**

1. **How do I find a therapist?:** Referrals from friends and family or people you trust are a great start. If those are not available I suggest a resource such as [psychologytoday.com](https://psychologytoday.com), which can help you narrow your search. If you are looking for affordable counseling, check if there are any nearby universities with sliding scale clinics where you could see a student (btw, there's some preliminary research that suggests there is little variance in outcomes from working with students versus seasoned clinicians). Sliding scale, for those who do not know, is when a therapist adjust their fee based on your gross or net income. Some therapists keep a ""pro bono"" or sliding scale case on their caseload, so it never hurts to ask. Also, many therapists are willing to set up brief, free consultations prior to treatment to see if it will be a good fit on both ends.
2. **How do I get over \[x\] or handle my \[x\]?** This is obviously a case-by-case basis. If you do not currently see a therapist, I would encourage you to seek one out who can properly assess and work with you/tailor therapy to fit your needs. There is no one-size-fits-all treatment for anxiety, depression, etc. It takes work, and can be a difficult, yet worthwhile journey that is made easier through the support of a mental health professional. There is NO shame in seeking out a therapist - it is a sign of strength, courage, and vulnerability.
3. **How do I convince \[x\] to go to therapy?**: At the end of the day, unless you're a parent responsible for a minor, you cannot ""force"" a person into therapy. However, I encourage everyone experiencing this issue to take time to listen to the potential shame and vulnerability around the suggestion. Suggesting therapy to a person often brings these feelings up, and they are worthy of listening to. Be supportive, warm, and compassionate, and hear their concerns. That might invite a more effective conversation :)
4. **How do I know if my video gaming is a real problem?** If you believe that it is, I encourage you to find a therapist who indicates that they have familiarity or interest in video gaming/ working with clients who play them. They can do a full assessment for something like Gaming Disorder. Quantity is not part of the criteria for a diagnosis such as that. If you're interested in reading more about my perspective, check out this Op-Ed I wrote for the Chicago Tribune: [**http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/commentary/ct-perspec-videogames-disorder-gamers-mental-health-world-health-organization-0629-story.html**](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/commentary/ct-perspec-videogames-disorder-gamers-mental-health-world-health-organization-0629-story.html)
5. **Am I doing this to promote my stream more than talk about mental health?** No. My Twitch channel is the platform that I can share this information through, though. The response has showed me that it's a group of people who have been wanting the space. I'm truly thankful for all of my followers and subscribers, but it's something I would be doing anyway. I truly am passionate about helping people break down their barriers to seeking the help of a therapist. It's something every one of us could use, whether healthy, struggling, or having an experience anywhere in-between.
6. **How do I know which therapist is right for me?** If you are seeking family or couple therapy (or poly therapy for the poly folks out there), a marriage/couple & family therapist is my recommendation. If you're interested in medication, seek out a reputable psychiatrist. You can also seek out social workers, clinical psychologists, or mental health counselors - they all exist to help!
7. **Where can I get a list of Dr. Mick's and others' writings about video gaming?** I don't have my writings aggregated - however, if you join my Twitch channel's Discord channel, I have a thread with my writings as well as other mental health resources. It's also a wonderful community ripe with incredible discussions. Google Scholar is also an excellent resource - make sure you look at the impact factors of journals you find video game/mental health info in - the higher the number, the more reputable.
8. **How do I become a therapist?** In the United States, graduate school is the way to go. Before determining which path, sit down and be honest with yourself about what modality (individual,couple,families) you are interested in working with, what kinds of issues (severe mental illness, psychosis, depression, anxiety, etc.) and in what contexts (agencies, private practice, schools, etc.) because that will dictate which mental health profession is right for you. If you go the MFT route, make sure you attend a COAMFTE-accredited school! There are also online options you can look into if you'd like to learn from home. And there is no age requirement, min or max - plenty of people change careers to become therapists!

Unfortunately, I cannot respond to inquiries for specific therapeutic advice or guidance, as I am bound by an ethical code and state licensure protocols. I will say, that based on the questions I've received, the need for more mental health care, de-stigmatization, and accessibility is totally necessary and will hopefully be welcomed in the coming months and years. De-stigmatizing therapy starts with all of us - if a person is struggling, be compassionate. Avoid playing into the notion that therapy is for the weak. It's for the strong. Many amazing therapists are out there ready and willing to help. And, if you don't feel a connection with your therapist, shop around! It should feel like the right fit.

I'm still working my way through my inbox, and will respond to those who I can over the coming days. If you'd like to ask me directly, join me and an amazingly supportive community at my stream - I'm on (pretty much) every night!

Thank you all for showing how much this matters. Let's keep the conversation going!!",2018-09-29 08:51:30

IamA 31 year old female with Hydrocephalus. I have had 19 brain surgeries so far and have a valve in my head that controls the flow rate of my spinal fluid. AMA!,17318,6t9s78,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/6t9s78/iama_31_year_old_female_with_hydrocephalus_i_have/,1651,1502588428.0,"**My short bio:** 

I was born with a condition called Hydrocephalus (commonly known as ""water on the brain"") where spinal fluid  builds up in the ventricles of the brain. I have a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) programmable shunt to re-route the excess fluid to organ tissue in my abdomen to be reabsorbed naturally. The ""programmable"" part is a valve in my head (outside of my skull, but under the skin) that can change the flow rate of my spinal fluid using magnets and without invasive surgery. However, my valve is stuck so the next time something goes wrong, I will need surgery again.

I have had this since birth and, due to complications, I have had 19 brain surgeries to date. There will likely be more in the future, but so far I have been surgery free for 5 years. 

I wanted to do this AMA to raise awareness for Hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus is a common birth defect, but hardly is talked about and does not get the funding for research that it truly needs. 1 in 500 to 1 in 1000 births result in Hydrocephalus; that's as common as down syndrome. Despite being a condition that has been acknowledged since 2500 BC, there was no treatment until 1952 AD. People often died of untreated hydrocephalus. Very few advancements have been made since the 1950s.

If you want to find out more, either ask me here or check out the [Hydrocephalus Association](http://www.hydroassoc.org/); it is a great resource.

**My proof:**
Proof was submitted privately, but [here's a picture I will share of my shunt being adjusted!](http://imgur.com/QhzjhxT)

Edit 2: This blew up so much! Thank you all for your questions. I'm going to try to keep answering them all but I definitely need a break.

And to answer a couple repeated questions, no, [this](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BiNE0HQV_mo/maxresdefault.jpg) is not what the valve looks like and I'm not a spokesperson for Valve. It looks like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DCtgRkrF40) and it sits just outside of my skull and under the skin.

Edit 4: I just want to remind everyone that I'm not a medical professional; just a professional patient. Please keep in mind that my answers are about *my* experiences and should not be taken over the advice of your neurosurgeon. 

To those of you asking about drinking water: When your brain is in distress, your body begins to dump sodium to protect it. If your sodium levels get too low, it's life threatening. To combat that, often doctors will prescribe salt pills and limit water intake. However, if your shunt is working fine, your brain isn't in distress and it's a moot point. Do not alter your water intake because of something you saw here, follow your neurosurgeon's advice. For me, I just hate the taste.

Thank you, everyone, for your responses.",2017-08-13 09:40:28

My name is Sae Han Sol Chung, and I am a 26 years old Korean. Got out of conscription in late January, and currently I'm a freelancer.

I climbed Kilimanjaro via 6-days Lemosho route from February 20th-25th. 20th was day 1. I had climbed many mountains in Korea, and also climbed Mt. Fuji last July. I wasn't obese at that time but after sustaining an ankle injury and resting for 3 months, I became quite badly out of shape. I believe my weight during the trip was around 96kg (211 pounds). 

I just wrote this and attached a single photo of myself along with a completion certificate to show that you can climb Kilimanjaro even if you are obese.

Feel free to ask me anything!

I'm Charlie and last night I was taking part in a night dive off the coast of Bali when I was interrupted by a 7.0 earthquake that occurred on Lombok, the nearest island to Bali. 

After the dive we drove to high ground due to the Indonesian government announcing a tsunami warning which was eventually removed after 90 minutes in the hills. 

The earthquake has resulted it around 100 deaths (and rising) and mass evacuation of the area near it. Just google 'Lombok Earthquake' if you want to read more about it.

1. How do you think a comedian's role has changed in the US society? your take on Trump clearly shows that you're rather some kind of a political force than a commentator or comedian otherwise you wouldn't try to intervene like you did with that episode and others (the Government Surveillance episode and many more). And don't get that wrong I think it's badly needed in today's mass media democratic societies.

2. How come that you care so much about the problems of the US democratic system and society? why does one get the notion that you care so passionately about this country that isn't your home country/ is your home country (only) by choice as if it were your home country? 

3. what was it like to meet Edward Snowden? was there anything special about him?

4. how long do you plan to keep Last Week Tonight running, would you like to do anything else like a daily show, stand-up or something like that?

5. do you refer to yourself rather being a US citizen than a citizen of the UK?

**Public Contact Information:**  https://twitter.com/iamjohnoliver (thanks to wspaniel)

**Questions from the comments**/**edit**

1.	Can we expect you to pressure Hillary/ Bernie in a similar way like you did with Trump? 
2.	Typically how long does it take to prepare the long segment in each episode? Obviously some take much longer than others (looking at you Our Lady of Perpetual Exemption) but what about episodes such as Donald Drumpf or Net Neutrality?
3.	How many people go into choosing the long segments?
4.	Do you frequently get mail about what the next big crisis in America is?
5.	Is LWT compensated (directly or indirectly) by or for any of the bits on companies/products that you discuss on your show? eg: Bud Lite Lime.
6.	Do you stick so strongly to your claims of ""comedy"" and ""satire"" in the face of accusations of being (or being similar to) a journalist because if you were a journalist you would be bound by a very different set of rules and standards that would restrict your ability to deliver your message?
7.	What keeps you up at night?
8.	Do you feel your show's placement on HBO limits its audience, or enhances it?
9.	Most entertainment has been trending toward shorter and shorter forms, and yet it's your longer-form bits that tend to go viral. Why do you think that is?
10.	How often does Time Warner choose the direction/tone of your show's content?
11.	What benefits do you receive from creating content that are directly in line with Time Warner's political interests?
12.	Do you find any of your reporting to be anything other than ""Gotcha Journalism""?

We are a senior Mueller reporter and former federal investigators who worked on some of the biggest cases since Watergate. Ask us anything.,16973,b5byl7,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/b5byl7/we_are_a_senior_mueller_reporter_and_former/,3148,1553556030.0,"Robert Mueller’s nearly two-year old investigation has finished, and President Donald Trump is celebrating a [partial victory](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/24/mueller-report-takeaways-1234097): no Russia collusion, but questions on obstruction. It’s a big moment, one which represents a significant mile-marker for the White House while adding more fuel onto the already heated congressional debate over whether to impeach the president.

While the special counsel’s work is done, the road ahead still remains unclear.

Let’s help break down where we are in a conversation with three investigators who worked under people who have been in Mueller’s shoes before: Ken Starr, Patrick Fitzgerald and Lawrence Walsh. Their experiences span three-plus decades of recent American history, giving them a unique perspective on what Mueller just completed.

More about us:

**Darren Samuelsohn** is a senior POLITICO reporter originally assigned to the “shenanigans” beat during the 2016 presidential campaign as Democrats scrambled to deal with the hackings later attributed to Russia. He’s been following the Mueller investigation from the beginning.

**Julie Myers Wood** was an Associate Independent Counsel who worked on both the Whitewater and Lewinsky investigations, and was one of writers of the Starr Report submitted to Congress. She has more than 24 years of experience in the public and private sector working on regulatory and enforcement issues from many perspectives, including as compliance consultant, defense counsel, government investigator, federal prosecutor, and Independent Monitor. She’s currently the CEO at Guidepost Solutions, a leading global investigations, compliance, and security firm.

**Randall Samborn** was the spokesman for the Special Counsel investigation of the leak of Valerie Plame’s identity and the resulting prosecution of I. Lewis “Scooter” Libby. He’s a former Assistant U.S. Attorney and Public Information Officer at the United States Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Illinois (Chicago; 1995-2015). Currently, he has his own communications consulting firm, Randall A. Samborn & Associates LLC.

**John Q. Barrett** was Associate Counsel in the Office of Iran-Contra Independent Counsel Lawrence E. Walsh from 1988-1992. Barrett worked there on various criminal investigations, prosecutions, and legal matters, including cases against Oliver L. North, John M. Poindexter, Elliott Abrams, and Caspar W. Weinberger, as liaison to intelligence agencies on national security matters, and on Independent Counsel Walsh’s final report to the court that appointed him. From 1994-1995, Barrett was Counselor to Inspector General Michael R. Bromwich in the U.S. Department of Justice. Currently he’s a law professor at St. John’s University in New York City, where he teaches Constitutional Law, Criminal Procedure, and Legal History.

"I'm Phil Mosby. Almost 2 years ago I quit my comfy web dev job so I could live out of my van and shoot astro-landscape photos full time. This last July, thanks in large part to Reddit, I was able to hang one of my pieces at the James Webb Space Telescope Mission Ops Center.

&#x200B;

In January of 2017 I took the plunge and quit my comfy, corporate front-end web-dev job to attempt to live out my dream of shooting landscape / astro-landscape photos and making & selling prints full time. I had saved up enough money to get me through the first few months, and I already had the large format printer and a (very small and slowly growing) ""following"" for my photography, but I knew I wouldn't be able to survive long with the rent I was paying, so I decided I would live out of [my van](https://i.imgur.com/8Tsjl4o.jpg) as long as necessary in order to make the dream (and the finances) work.

&#x200B;

Proof: [https://i.imgur.com/PCpusQ9.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/PCpusQ9.jpg)

&#x200B;

I share a [shop space](https://www.reddit.com/r/raining/comments/8n9li9/working_in_the_print_shop_with_the_garage_door/) (glorified garage) with two other artists, without which this would not have been feasible. It has not been easy, but after almost two years I am still going strong, my business is growing, and I've had some amazing successes such as hanging one of my [hexagon shaped pieces](https://i.imgur.com/Y85vLPy.jpg) in the [entry way to the James Webb Space Telescope Mission Operations Center in Baltimore, Maryland](https://imgur.com/a/GSOtioc). It still amazes me every single day that I get to do this for a living, and although I have a long way to go to be as financially secure as I was with the corporate job, **I have never once, not even on the hardest of days, regretted the decision to pursue this path.**

&#x200B;

In addition to the normal photography and print making, you might also recognize my name from my ""[Glowing Night](https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/comments/8y1iyj/dimming_the_lights_in_the_shop/)"" collection of prints which are pretty popular on Reddit. These are astro-landscape photos printed on canvas and then meticulously ""[glow painted](https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/comments/9c79x7/dropping_dots_my_friend_scott_glowpainting_one_of/)"" to create pieces of art that are beautiful even after dark.

&#x200B;

As an ex web-developer / designer, I also coded every bit of my [website](http://www.phil.camera/?iama) from scratch, including special features like my Auction page which took me several weeks worth of programming, but which has turned into a large part of my income and has allowed me to grow my following and ship my art all around the world!

&#x200B;

Using all of my skills to build a business based on something I love to do is incredibly satisfying.  Knowing that people from around the world are using software I wrote to purchase art that I  [made by hand](https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/comments/8zwat4/fasthands_makin_stuff_two_days_of_work_distilled/) ... it's a special feeling and an incredible honor to be able to share my art with others and make a living doing so.

&#x200B;

Ask me anything about astro-landscape photography, the trip to NASA, quitting the day job, plans for the future, chasing dreams, living in a van, printing & selling art, or whatever's on your mind. I'll be here until about Noon Pacific time. Thanks Reddit, I wouldn't be here without you!

&#x200B;

EDIT: Hey guys and gals, this has been a boat load of fun but I've got to get back to work for a bit. Please feel free to keep firing the questions and I'll answer as many as I can later this evening. Thanks again Reddit, I love you.

&#x200B;

PS: No, not related to Bill Cosby. No, you can't run in my lobby. And yes, this is classic Schmosby right here.

&#x200B;

Edit 2 - 9/6/2018: Just one more edit. I want to say thank you so much for the Reddit Gold to the two of you who sent it my way! I was up late last night trying to reply to as many comments as possible, and I'll get through even more of them today, and thank you to all the commentors as well. If I don't reply to your specific question by the end of the day today it probably means that it was answered multiple times elsewhere in the thread, so poke around a bit, or feel free to shoot me a pm once my inbox cools off.

&#x200B;

**Regarding photo gear:** A LOT of people have been asking about gear, and I've mostly avoided getting too deep into specific camera / lens / tracker / tripod models, and that is deliberate. ANY modern, full-frame DSLR can take decent astro landscape photos, and while purchasing a more expensive camera body can allow you to take cleaner photos at higher ISO, the best astro-landscape photos are going to rely more on technique than just a good sensor. I personally use an equatorial tracking mount (iOptron's line is fantastic and pretty affordable, but there are others out there as well) to enable very long exposures at low ISO and thus low noise (remember that noise is also caused by long exposure, not just ISO, so this must be kept to a limit also and your sensor quality does play a part), but there's another popular technique that involves taking several almost identical images and then using software to ""stack"" them and greatly reduce noise and increase detail. Check out [http://deepskystacker.free.fr/](http://deepskystacker.free.fr/) for more info on that process.

&#x200B;

That being said, when you're first starting out who cares about a little noise, the magic is just pointing your camera at a dark sky and then seeing the amazing color and light that is actually hidden up there in plain site!  Google the ""Rule of 500"" for a very basic primer of how to shoot the night sky with your existing gear. You will likely have very noisy images, but again, in the beginning, who cares they'll still be cool and it's great practice!

&#x200B;

If you're just getting into astro landscape photography, it's much easier to start with a wide lens (with near infinite DOF), and I'll recommend the budget friendly Samyang 14mm as a great starter lens. They make it for both Canon and Nikon (I believe it also comes under the Rokinon brand but it is the exact same lens.)

&#x200B;

A solid tripod is important, and if you get into using a star tracker you'll want to make sure you purchase a tripod that can hold upwards of 15 - 20 lbs comfortably.

&#x200B;

That's all I have to say about that. Thanks again for reading, everyone. Have a great day, and get out there and shoot tonight while the moon is dark!!",2018-09-06 08:57:29

Dr. Cindy Fast holds a Ph.D. and Master’s degree in Psychology specialising in Learning and Behaviour and Behavioural Neuroscience from UCLA. Cindy has more than ten years of experience conducting behavioural research with a variety of species including rats, mice, pigeons, hermit crabs, and horses. 

In September Cindy moved from the US to take on her new role at APOPO. Dr. Fast plans to use her knowledge and expertise to optimize training and performance of the HeroRATs.

**My Proof:** [Dr. Cindy Fast with Jones the HeroRAT.](https://twitter.com/HeroRATs/status/806466952931713025) 

**About APOPO:** APOPO is a non-profit that trains rats to save lives. Based in Tanzania, the organisation has pioneered the development of scent detection rats, nicknamed HeroRATs. 

APOPO's landmine detection rats have helped sniff out more than 100,000 mines helping to free nearly one million people from the threat of explosives. 

APOPO's tuberculosis detection rats have safely sniffed more than 350,000 sputum samples identifying 10,000 additional cases of TB that were missed by clinics. 

APOPO website - https://www.apopo.org/en/

Adopt or gift a HeroRAT - https://support.apopo.org/en/adopt

Donate - https://support.apopo.org/en/donate

Dr. Fast will begin answering questions at 12pm EST. 

EDIT - It's late night in Tanzania and Dr Fast has had to retire for the evening. Our Fundraising Manager, Robin Toal, will take over from here on out but will need to report back on any particularly tricky questions. Big thanks for all your questions, it's been a blast!

EDIT 2 - It's time to say goodnight (UK here). I'll pop back in the morning and will ask Dr Fast to answer a selection of the questions we didn't get to tonight. Thanks for your questions and if you're looking for a holiday gift you can't go wrong with a HeroRAT adoption. ",2016-12-08 08:31:04

Welcome Back!,16705,3c0hcz,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3c0hcz/welcome_back/,4221,1435973101.0,"You may have noticed that /r/IAmA was recently set to ""private"" for a short period of time. A full explanation can be found [here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3bw39q/why_has_riama_been_set_to_private/), but the gist of it is that Victoria was unexpectedly let go from Reddit and the admins did not have a good alternative to help conduct AMAs. As a result, our current system will no longer be feasible. 

Chooter (Victoria) was let go as an admin by /u/kn0thing.  She was a pillar of the AMA community and responsible for nearly all of reddit's positive press.  She helped not only IAMA grow, but reddit as a whole.  reddit's culture would not be what it is today without Victoria's efforts over the last several years.

We have taken the day to try to understand how Reddit will seek to replace Victoria, and have unfortunately come to the conclusion that they do not have a plan that we can put our trust in. The admins have refused to provide essential information about arranging and scheduling AMAs with their new 'team.' This does not bode well for future communication between us, and we cannot be sure that everything is being arranged honestly and in accordance with our rules. The information we have requested is essential to ensure that money is not changing hands at any point in the procedure which is necessary for /r/IAmA to remain equal and egalitarian. As a result, we will no longer be working with the admins to put together AMAs. Anyone seeking to schedule an AMA can simply message the moderators or email us at AMAVerify@gmail.com, and we'd be happy to assist and help prepare them for the AMA in any way. We will also be making some future changes to our requirements to cope with Victoria's absence. Most of these will be behind-the-scenes tweaks to how we help arrange AMAs beforehand, but if there are any rule changes we will let you all know in a sticky post.

---

We'd like to take this moment to thank Victoria for all of her work on thousands of AMAs. Her cheerfulness, attitude, work ethic, and so many other attributes made her the perfect person for this job. We mods truly feel that she is irreplaceable. Thanks for everything, /u/Chooter, and we wish you the best of luck going forward.

Thank you all for your patience during this debacle (and for the hundreds of messages of support!), and we hope to have many interesting AMAs for you all in the future. Please let us know if you have any questions in the comments below! Additionally, a former admin has asked to do an AMA about his experiences with Reddit, and you can ask him questions about the inner workings of the site as soon as his AMA goes live [here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3c0idl/i_am_dacvak_former_reddit_employee_and_leukemia/).

Edit July 5, 2015 - Alexis Ohanian (/u/kn0thing) has been working with us over the weekend to institute new protocols for how reddit, inc. will work with the mods of communities looking to hosts AMAs (including, but limited to r/IAmA). The goal is to create a much more 'hands off' system regarding the scheduling and facilitation of AMAs. He has described the team of existing admins in charge of funneling AMAs to the right mods for scheduling in the interim. This team will be replaced by a full time employee in the future.

He has also described the new team in charge facilitating AMAs and some of their broader objectives concerning integrating talent as consistent posters rather than one off occurrences. This more relates to the site as a whole rather than how /r/IamA functions day to day.  While we're still unhappy with how this transition occurred, it would be unfair for us not to publicly recognize the recent efforts on the part of the site administration to 'make it right'.",2015-07-04 09:25:01

You can find the first AMA [HERE](https://amp.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/apxlfk/im_ethan_an_18_year_old_who_made_national/)

My first AMA was addressing how my story blew up, and the strange place I was in with the news cycle placing attention on myself and my family. That’s a completely different situation than this senate hearing, and I figured we could address some of your questions in this post. So send them my way and I’ll try to answer as many as I can! 

Also, [HERES](https://imgur.com/gallery/7gNLS4p) a picture from the testimony in my very dapper suit.

Edit: for those that don’t know what this is all about, I made a Reddit post a few months ago that blew up. From there, larger and larger articles and stories were written about me and my family. Eventually I spoke before congress on the importance of vaccines and the dangers of misinformation. You can find the full committee hearing [HERE](https://www.help.senate.gov/hearings/vaccines-save-lives-what-is-driving-preventable-disease-outbreaks) some examples of the coverage of the committee include

Edit 2: I’m going to bed, and tomorrow I’ll try to answer some more questions as I go through them! 

Edit 3: thanks for an awesome AMA Reddit! I’m 99% sure this is my last AMA, just because this story will probably die down from here.

We have been actively developing this version of the game, implementing quality of life and content updates which are approved by over 75% of the community. In fact, we are just about to release our first ever quest - **Monkey Madness II** - a sequel to a quest line started over 11 years ago.

We are a bit of an anomaly in the games industry, and the concept of Old School RuneScape can often boggle the minds of onlookers, so we wanted to answer any questions you may have.

It has been almost two years since my last AMA, and I think with all I've had happen in the past little while it would be nice to take some time to come back and chat. The previous AMAs can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1s4l7v/i_am_col_chris_hadfield_retired_astronaut/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1dhovl/hi_from_orbit_reddit_i_helped_canada_unveil_its/). If I'm unable to get to your question today, there's a chance that you'll be able to find my responses there.
 
Before our conversation, I’d like to highlight three things that I've been up to recently, as they might be of interest to you.

The first is [Generator](http://www.generatorevent.com/) ([fb event](https://www.facebook.com/events/712627588883618/)). Happening on the 28th (in 5 days) at Toronto's historic Massey Hall, it is a blend of comedy, science and music in the style of Brian Cox and Robin Ince's yearly event at the Hammersmith Apollo in London. The intent is to create a space for incredible, esoteric ideas and performers to reach a mainstream audience. For example, Marshall Jones' slam poem [Touchscreen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFX2LrNE3VI) is undeniably fascinating, but through an uncommon medium that makes seeing it inaccessible. I want Toronto to have a platform where performers can meet a large audience more interested in their message than their medium. It isn’t a show that is easy to describe, but I think it will be one that is memorable. While I wouldn't call it a charity event in the way that term is often used, the proceeds from the show will be going to local non-profits that are making definitive, positive change. If you're in the area, we'd love to have you there. The more people come out, the stronger we can make it in the future. I'm really looking forward to it.
 
The second is my recent album, [Space Sessions: Songs From a Tin Can](http://chrishadfield.ca/music/), of which I am immensely proud. The vocals and guitar were recorded in my sleeping pod on station, and then later mixed with a complement of talented artists here on Earth. The final music video of the album, from the song Beyond the Terra, will be released in the coming days. My proceeds from the album will be going to support youth music education in Canada.

The third is my upcoming animated science-comedy series, ""It's Not Rocket Science"", which will be a released on YouTube and is aimed at changing the talking points on a number of contentious public views of scientific concepts. For example, encouraging vaccination by explaining smallpox, not vaccines, or explaining climate change via the Aral Sea, rather than CO2. While it is still in production, we have set up a [Patreon account](https://www.patreon.com/notrocketscience?ty=h) to provide background updates to how things are progressing with the talented group making it a reality, as well as helping to cover the costs of keeping it free to view.
 
With that said - ask me anything!",2015-10-24 10:31:45

We also fight [ag-gag legislation](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/01/opinion/no-more-exposes-in-north-carolina.html?mcubz=0), which criminalizes whistleblowers and investigators who document animal abuse in factory farms.

Lastly, I helped launch [New Crop Capital](http://www.newcropcapital.com) and [The Good Food Institute](http://www.gfi.org), two entities focused on advancing [“clean meat”](http://www.cleanmeat.com) (meat grown in cell culture) and better plant-based foods.

My name is Meagan Allen, I'm a volunteer with an NGO called Exponential Education in Ghana and I'm here now with some of our students from Ejisu Model Junior Secondary School, Frank, Dzifa, Faustina, Janet, and Aba. Ask us Anything!


Here in Ghana, the education system has many challenges, including an over-reliance on rote learning, lack of funding and resources in general, and under/poorly-trained teachers.


To help counter these challenges, Exponential Education runs various after-school programs, ranging from our flagship Peer-to-Peer Math and English tutoring program, to our Girls Leadership, Empowerment, and Action (LEAP) program, to our Level Up Village (LUV) classes, which focus on Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math (STEAM).


At Ejisu Model JHS we currently run a [LUV Global Doctors Anatomy](http://www.levelupvillage.com/global-doctors-anatomy/) class. The students meet once a week after school to learn about human body systems in a hands-on and interactive way. Through this class, they use scalpels and forceps to dissect and learn, something they would not have the opportunity to do in a regular Ghanaian classroom. We are also running a [Global Inventors](http://www.levelupvillage.com/global-inventors/) class, where they get to learn about 3D printing! The kids are also partnered with a school in another country that they exchange videos with to learn about each other's culture, while also sharing observations about their hands-on classes. 


If you'd like to help support our organization and important programs like these, please visit our donations page [here](http://www.exponentialeducationprogram.org/donate). A small amount can go a long way and any contribution would be greatly appreciated! None of our American staff take salaries and field staff like myself take small living stipends. All of your donations will go towards supporting our programs here on the ground.



I'd also be happy to send donors a thank-you card from the kids, Ghanaian chocolate, locally produced fabrics and crafts, etc. Just PM me your details so we can work out shipping.



If you are interested in learning about our other programs, check out our past AMAs and our various social media:

UPDATE 11/26 5:36 GMT: The kids and Ms. Elsie had to go home for chores and dinner. I will continue to answer remaining questions, but am about to travel from my office to home (dinner time), so I'll get to them soon!

**Edit** Yeah, you know what? I wanna say - I want to thank you for being FRIENDS. Because fans, they know your successes.

But friends know your failures.

So I want to thank the people who've read my book, the people who follow me on Twitter, the people who just discovered me, and just want to let you know that I'm no different than any other person out there. I hope I can encourage you to go for your dream, no matter what it is, and if you can look at me and be inspired, I want to inspire me.

I love you all. You are talking to the most thankful man in Hollywood. Thank you so much. ",2015-01-30 13:21:20

Some of you may recall [my last AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5dfesh/i_am_a_uk_cheap_flight_hacker_here_to_help_you/), shortly after I started my little project: Jack’s Flight Club (and that’s ‘flight’ not ‘fight’ …not to be confused with United Airlines’ new seating class). 

You can check it out here if you like: [Jack's Flight Club](https://www.jacksflightclub.co.uk/) 

We're nothing fancy… we basically send our members a note when flights to amazing places go really, reeeeaaaally cheap (like round-trip from UK to Hawaii at £289 cheap) and tell them where to book them before they are all gone. 


In the last 5 months we’ve grown from a tiny membership newsletter of mostly my friends to over 75,000 members and, in the meantime, have saved travellers a ridiculous £500,000 on airfare - which I’m very proud of!


We’ve had stories of members getting to finally see their far-away family, get engaged, go on honeymoons, find new love, and visit places they never thought they could afford. It’s been a VERY hectic 5 months since the last one and I’ve decided to come back and host another AMA to answer any questions about our journey, cheap travel, and offer any advice I can for your next trip! 


**My Proof:** [That guy](http://observer.com/2016/11/7-tips-from-a-flight-hacker-whos-flown-to-43-countries-for-barely-any-money/)

So...ask me anything!

I’ll do my best to stick around after and answer them all - much more caffeinated and prepared this time around!



**EDIT** hey guys, the site is getting hug of death!! (not to mention my inbox) Try refreshing a few times and it should load if you are keen to check it out.

**EDIT 4.5 hrs in** Thanks for the gold strangers!! My back is killing me, and I'm going to grab a quick bite and stretch, but will be back in 10 min. I'll try to keep this going for a couple more hours at least. Sorry if I don't get to your questions until after that however - I don't think my keyboard has ever taken such a beating!!

**EDIT** Ok I'm back. BRING IT!!!

**EDIT** HUG OF DEATH ALERT! You guys seem to have brought me down.

**EDIT** OK guys I'm wrapping this one up now, thanks so much for all your questions and positive feedback. Been awesome chatting to all of you and catching up with existing JFC members too! I'll do my best go through and answer as many outstanding questions as possible over the next few days and get back to those that have emailed. Thanks again it's been loads of fun :) ",2017-04-13 01:01:05
My daughter died from Zellweger Syndrome. My wife and I are here to answer your questions about our experience and our non-profit Lily's List.

In conjuction with Giving Tuesday my wife and I have decided to hold our second AMA. Our daughter Lily was born with a rare genetic condition called Zellweger Syndrome. The condition left her blind, mentally retarded, and epileptic. My wife and I became fulltime caregivers for almost five months until Lily ultimately passed.

https://www.lilyslist.org/

In Lily's honor my wife and I founded a Non-profit organization named ""Lily's List"". Our mission is to assist parents and caregivers as they transition home from the hospital. We accomplish this by providing small items that insurance often won't pay for. Our ""love boxes"" make the caregiver's day a little bit more organized and hopefully easier. Below are only a few of the items we include: 


* Specialized surge protector for the numerous monitors and medical equipment


* A whiteboard for tracking medications, seizures, and emergency data


* A wall organizer for random medical equipment 


* Cord wraps for easy transportation

Taylor and I are happy to answer any questions regarding our experience or Lily's List. **No question is off limits. Please do not hold back.**

Edit: Taylor and I are going to sleep now but please continue to ask questions. We will get back at them tomorrow. :) Thank you everyone for your support!",2018-11-27 11:47:38

I started as a novice reporter in a local daily and a decade later I was running one of the most popular news websites in Russia as a senior editor at a major news agency. Now I work for an upstart non-profit newsroom http://www.codastory.com as the managing editor of their Russian-language website http://www.codaru.com and contribute reports and op-eds as a freelancer to a variety of national Russian and international news outlets. 

I also founded a website called The Noodle Remover ('to hang noodles on someone's ears' means to lie, to BS someone in Russian) where I debunk false narratives in Russian news media and run epic crowdsourced, crowdfunded investigations about corruption in Russia and other similar subjects. Here's a story about it: https://globalvoices.org/2015/11/03/one-mans-revenge-against-russian-propaganda/. 

Ask me questions about press freedom in Russia (ranked 148 out of 180 by Reporters Without Borders https://rsf.org/en/ranking), what it's like working as a journalist there (it's bad, but not quite as bad as Turkey and some other places and I don't expect to be chopped up in pieces whenever I'm visiting a Russian embassy abroad), why Pravda isn't a ""leading Russian newspaper"" (it's not a newspaper and by no means 'leading') and generally about how Russia works. 

Fun fact: I was fired by Vladimir Putin's executive order (okay, not just I: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-25309139). I've also just returned from a 9 weeks trip around the United States where I visited various American newsrooms as part of a fellowship for international media professionals, so I can talk about my impressions of the U.S. as well.

My name is Chas Allen and I’m an author, public speaker, entrepreneur and life coach, but most famously I’m know for my role in the Transylvania Book Heist. When I was 19, myself and three others attempted to steal first edition books and paintings valued at over twelve million dollars, from the Transylvania University library. Among the items stolen were John James Audubon’s “Birds of American Collection” and Charles Darwin’s “On the Origin of Species.” We were eventually caught and were sentenced to seven years in federal prison.
 
In jail, I found myself at rock bottom and made the choice to turn my life around. In my new book “Evolution: Becoming a Criminal” I depict how my upbringing and personal struggles led me to my involvement in the criminal act, and the growth and development that transpired once heading to prison and being released. The story of my youth has also been turned into a major motion picture.  “American Animals,” written and directed by Bart Layton stars Evan Peters, Barry Keoghan, Jared Abrahamson, and Blake Jenner. The film was released on June 1.
