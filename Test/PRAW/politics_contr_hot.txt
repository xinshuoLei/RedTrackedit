Saturday Morning Political Cartoon Thread,159,dk5m00,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/dk5m00/saturday_morning_political_cartoon_thread/,200,1571529555.0,"It's Saturday, folks. Let's all kick back with a cup of coffee and share some cartoons!

Feel free to share political cartoons in this thread. Besides our usual civility policy, there are three rules to follow:

1. **Every top-level comment must contain a political cartoon.** This means no text-only top-level comments.
2. **It must be an _original cartoon_**. This means no photographs, no edited cartoons, no memes and no image macros. OC is allowed, as is animation. 
3. **Each top-level comment should only have a maximum of 3 cartoons.** 

That's all. Enjoy your weekend!",159

White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said Trump would not profit from use of the property and defended the decision, which comes as the president faces ongoing criticism and congressional investigations over his finances and potential conflicts-of-interest.

I'm a 27 year-old Brazilian-American immigrant, Stanford engineer, and social justice advocate. I'm running for Congress because our system is broken, and I believe a new generation of bold leadership can fix it.

We have seen the result of trusting the current political establishment to guide us into the future. Since Nancy Pelosi took office in 1989, [inequality](https://www.epi.org/productivity-pay-gap/) has risen along with [the sea levels](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/08/01/magazine/climate-change-losing-earth.html). The amount of money spent on political campaigns [has skyrocketed](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/12/07/as-more-money-flows-into-campaigns-americans-worry-about-its-influence/). Our schools are [more segregated](https://www.vox.com/2018/3/5/17080218/school-segregation-getting-worse-data). Incarceration [has increased](https://sentencingproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Trends-in-US-Corrections.pdf) upwards of 500%. An entire generation became [the first in history](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/07/revealed-30-year-economic-betrayal-dragging-down-generation-y-income) to be poorer than their parents.

We need people in government who embrace new ideas to solve old problems. I'm a champion of the Green New Deal, Medicare-for-All, and Universal Basic Income. I'm also hoping to bring informed, practical, and future-savvy tech regulation to the forefront of politics in Washington. One of my the areas I'm most passionate about is using emerging technology to enable a more participatory political system.

Let's build the future I know we are capable of. Ask Me Anything!
