Do not spend a SINGLE CENT on micro transactions until shaders become unlimited use. #MakeFashionGreatAgain,44044,6yi1yg,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/6yi1yg/do_not_spend_a_single_cent_on_micro_transactions/,2793,1504756376.0,"I recognize that we are one day into D2's life span, but this is one issue that doesn't need to be further understood. The fact of the matter is, shaders being one time use is a deliberate decision to make an aspect of the game worse, for the sake of profit. I can easily break down why there is no good reason for shaders to be one time use, and why the original system was infinitely better.

1. Frequent consumable drops are not an improvement over rarer permanent rewards.

Getting a stockpile of shaders doesn't beat just having a collection you can use at will, even if the shader drops were so frequent that you never ran out of the ones you want. At that point, why even have them be consumable? Because you're supposed to run out, get impatient, and just start dumping money into eververse so you CAN have a stockpile. 

2. You're going to be collecting armor and weapons in this game, and you're going to need a shader for each and every piece. 

So you did the raid, congratulations! You get one raid shader. Cool! You have dozens and dozens of pieces of gear, and you wanna make most of that gear represent what you achieved. Too bad, you'll have to run the raid possibly hundreds of times to do that. If you decide you like the way a new shader looks on a piece of raid shader gear, kiss that particular raid shader goodbye. 

3. Min-maxers and collectors will basically never use shaders until they have absolutely perfect gear, if they run the risk of losing those shaders every time they find something better.

If you find a piece of equipment you really like, you'll probably wanna throw a snazzy shader on there right? Or do you? Because you might find something better. You never know. Better just hold onto that shader for basically forever because you're constantly in a cycle of finding better gear. It's Destiny. Swapping gear happens every 5 minutes. 

4. Making something that used to be fun, simple recoloring of gear, into a commitment is not a good change.

People like to customize their characters. Some people (myself included) like to do so frequently, and experiment with different looks. If you're burning through shaders, you can't tinker with your appearance at will. 



IN SUMMARY: No one really cares how mad any of us get about the shader situation, but people notice when they aren't making money. I recognize only a small portion of Destiny's player base follows this sub, but the more people we can convince to boycott this micro-transaction BS until something this gets resolved, the better for the long term health of D2.  Micro transactions for cosmetics are usually harmless, but we had a better system in the first game. Plain and simple. This was a choice, and it was not a choice made with the enjoyment of the game in mind. 

Edit: first gold off of a Destiny rant I threw up on my break... thanks stranger!

Edit numero dos: I didn't think this post was gonna get nearly as big as it actually has... and I'm aware of the light media coverage it's getting, so I wanted to take this as an opportunity to say thanks to everyone that shared their opinions with me and the rest of the playerbase. I just wanted to add, I am not against micro-transactions entirely. I don't like them, but I do believe there is a healthy way to implement them into Destiny 2, and the way they're currently being handled isn't it. My main issue here is that shaders did not need this change. They were one of the only things Destiny 1 did really well right out of the gate. I'm a year 1 veteran Destiny player, and I absolutely love Destiny 2 so far. Bungie, you killed it. Thank you. That being said, this a really good chance to make a show of good faith to your community. Just let us keep the shaders we collect. It was a great system to begin with, and I think this community is pretty unanimously unhappy with the new system, aside from the individual shader placement on gear. It feels predatory and it has a lot of people worried about what other ""one step forward, two steps back"" kind of changes may be in the future. We really aren't asking for much here. Bungie plz. I'll let everyone else crucify you for the rest of the micro transaction nonsense that's slowly being pushed, I just want my pretty colors back first.

Also I'm aware that the bullet points are all ones... painfully aware... 


Final Edit now that we've gotten a response: Damn. Well boys and girls it seems the new system is here to stay. I'm not happy about it, but hopefully we are all just as whiny and melodramatic as we're being made out to be, and shaders will end up being in ridiculous surplus (which will basically make them like they were in D1.) At the end of the day, Destiny 2 is a fantastic game outside of this one annoying issue. Grinding out raid shaders is going to suck, and purchased shaders still being a one time use seems pretty damn unfair. That being said, if this much uproar isn't going to change anything, I guess we'll just have to deal with it. So many aspects of the game are great, I can forgive this one. Still not going to spend a single penny on micro-transactions though.",2017-09-07 11:52:56

When we first launched our partnership with Activision in 2010, the gaming industry was in a pretty different place. As an independent studio setting out to build a brand new experience, we wanted a partner willing to take a big leap of faith with us. We had a vision for Destiny that we believed in, but to launch a game of that magnitude, we needed the support of an established publishing partner.


With Activision, we created something special. To date, Destiny has delivered a combination of over 50 million games and expansions to players all around the world. More importantly, we’ve also witnessed a remarkable community – tens of millions of Guardians strong – rise up and embrace Destiny, to play together, to make and share memories, and even to do truly great things that reach far beyond the game we share, to deliver a positive impact on people’s everyday lives.


We have enjoyed a successful eight-year run and would like to thank Activision for their partnership on Destiny. Looking ahead, we’re excited to announce plans for Activision to transfer publishing rights for Destiny to Bungie. With our remarkable Destiny community, we are ready to publish on our own, while Activision will increase their focus on owned IP projects.


The planned transition process is already underway in its early stages, with Bungie and Activision both committed to making sure the handoff is as seamless as possible.


With Forsaken, we’ve learned, and listened, and leaned in to what we believe our players want from a great Destiny experience. Rest assured there is more of that on the way. We’ll continue to deliver on the existing Destiny roadmap, and we’re looking forward to releasing more seasonal experiences in the coming months, as well as surprising our community with some exciting announcements about what lies beyond.


Thank you so much for your continued support. Our success is owed in no small part to the incredible community of players who have graced our worlds with light and life. We know self-publishing won’t be easy; there’s still much for us to learn as we grow as an independent, global studio, but we see unbounded opportunities and potential in Destiny. We know that new adventures await us all on new worlds filled with mystery, adventure, and hope. We hope you’ll join us there.


See you starside.

"Bungie, Save your IP.

The storyline a steaming pile. If you do not act promptly and with absolute, utter, privacy-invading transparency, you will lose any pull the Destiny IP ever had and the Bungie name will forever be a verb that denotes the tremendous prolapsing asspull of these past months that will be your legacy.**
____________________

So what is the ""Realm Reborn Treatment""?

See this three-part documentary about the life, death, and rebirth of an online MMO: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs0yQKI7Yw4

But for those who don't have two hours to burn, let me explain.

For those who are not familiar, Final Fantasy XIV when it was initially released (1.0) was an absolutely horrible game. Recognizing this somewhere down the line, Square-Enix brought in a new director and producer by the name of Naoki Yoshida.

He came in and basically said, listen. **We're going to remake this from the ground up. Meanwhile, we release DLC at no charge to the player while we continue to build up 2.0.**

Eventually, they released 2.0, and now FFXIV is now one of the best MMOs in the world, having released two expansions loaded with content up to your eyeballs, with a VAST cast of memorable and engaging characters and an engaging storyline.

For Destiny 1, the ""Treatment"" could arguably be called The Taken King.

But in a game like Destiny 2, where the foundation was so painstakingly laid in its predecessor then thrown away for no perceptible reason, this is simply not acceptable.

This is not just about the survival of Destiny 2, but the survival of the Destiny IP and the Bungie name. Your failures are on display for the whole gaming community to see.

Bungie, you have to make a decision. Be a shell of your former glory and become the eternal laughingstock of game studios, or approach this aggressively and openly.

I don't give a good god damn whether it's Activision or Bungie itself at the wheels. As far as I'm concerned, a shit game was delivered for the second time and they both need to answer for it.

Do or die, Bungie. Fix it or burn out of existence.

_____________

Edit: There are those who are saying that FFXIV 1.0 is incomparable to D2 in its current form. I am copying and pasting a reply to one such post from earlier:
> 
> I would actually concur. FFXIV 1.0 had core playability issues that D2 doesn't have.
> 
> D2's foundation as a game, as a title, however, are deeply flawed, and nothing short of an actual reboot to those gameplay mechanisms, economy and narrative will serve the game better. While the engine itself doesn't need to be changed, there are so many foundational problems to be addressed it might just be a Mini Realm Reborn Treatment.
> 
> If we allow Bungie to just say, ""Oh, we'll do better with the following expansions,"" then what did the years with D1 even mean?
> 
> It is my opinion, after seeing all that I've seen so far, that we need to be very harsh with Bungie and company if we meant to get what the game needs to thrive and be the MMO-FPS powerhouse that it wants to be.
> 
> Unrealistic? Perhaps. But with what I've been feeling from the community, people are less willing to put up with Bungie's antics. If this continues, no one will see Bungie as reputable anymore and will decline to even look their way when they put out another Destiny title until it's been thoroughly vetted by the press.
> 
> If Bungie cannot win back the population of their largest franchise to date (I think, not sure), it will be a huge blow to the health of the studio, and ultimately to the game that we are all so passionate about and so desperate to want to succeed.
> 
> If this change is to succeed, it must come from within Bungie. Even though there's contracts and the like with Activision, if someone can find a way through this, it has to be Bungie.
> 
> I hope I have clarified my views on the matter.

Edit2: Obligatory thanks for the gold, but I don't think I deserve it. I didn't even think this post would even gain traction, much less earn me gold. 

There are those out there who have described my post as dramatic- I would have to humbly agree. Theatrical and inflammatory, but I do believe the idea of the post still stands.

Another post further down from /u/ThatBlessedOne ([link here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/7j1cdm/bungie_save_your_ip_run_the_realm_reborn/dr319gt/)) mentioned the humanity of the people behind the game, and while it's important to at times forcefully nudge people down the right path, we shouldn't ever forsake the people behind the game, whose talents I'm sure are being suppressed by some other force higher up in the ladder. I hope you get to make the game you want to, soon.

Hey everyone,


With Destiny 2’s console and PC launches behind us, we want to take some time to talk with you about Destiny 2 – specifically where it’s at today, and where it’s going. Our team has been reading feedback and working on updates to improve the game. We’ve also been reading some tough criticism about our lack of communication, and we agree we need to be more open. 

Going forward, Destiny 2’s post-launch game systems, features, and updates are being designed specifically to focus on and support players who want Destiny to be their hobby – the game they return to, and a game where friendships are made. We want Destiny to be a game that fits into your life, providing you with reasons to log in and play with your friends, clans, and families. We want Destiny to be a world you want to be a part of.

A month ago, we published a list of improvements on the blog. Today, we’re going to revisit that list and update its status, and share some of the work the team is readying for December, January, and beyond.

We know it’s frustrating when there isn’t enough of a dialog with the development team. You have our commitment that we’re going to do a better job going forward.

>- Luke Smith & Chris Barrett

**Upcoming Updates Overview**

We previously published [a list of upcoming Destiny 2 improvements](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/46427) we want to deliver. Some of these updates will be introduced on December 5 and December 12. Others will land in the New Year.


- New systems and rewards to give our most engaged players additional, optional pursuits, including:


 - A new Weapon Tier: Masterworks, which will feature stat trackers, random, re-rollable stat bonuses, unique item tooltips, and item details screens (see the December Update Details section below for more info)
 - Improved vendor rewards, adding ways for people to purchase items directly with their Legendary Shards and Tokens (see the December Update Details section below for more info)
 - Adding Armor Ornaments that grant visual permutations of armor as players complete specific Challenges (see the December Update Details section below for more info)


- Better incentives for players who complete challenging Prestige activities


 - We’re targeting a January update to provide better incentives to complete Prestige activities


- Better rewards and replay value for Strikes, Adventures, and Lost Sectors


 - In December, we will be introducing a Heroic Strikes playlist and more generous Strike rewards
 - Rewards for Adventures and Lost Sectors are still on our radar, but will not be delivered for our December updates


- Private matches for the Crucible


 - Still targeting early 2018 and expect to have better insight into exact timing in the New Year
 - We are also moving Ranked PVP to the top of our priority list for next year to support the competitive community


- Crucible tuning like adjusted Supremacy scoring and better spawning rules


 - In December, we will introduce additional updates and bug-fixes intended to improve these areas of the Crucible


- Better incentives for completing Crucible matches (and penalties for quitting competitive games)


 - A ""Quitter Penalty"" system is currently in development, and you can expect an update on the deployment of this system in the New Year


- Continued improvements to Iron Banner and Faction Rallies, including uniqueness of rewards


 - The next Iron Banner and Faction Rally will introduce improvements in both these areas (see the December Update Details section below for more info)


- Changes to make the mod economy more interesting and impactful


 - The Gunsmith will have some updates to how Mods are acquired (see the December Update Details section below for more info)

 - Players will be able to spend Tokens and Legendary Shards on Vendor inventory (see the December Update Details section below for more info)
 - Xur will have new items, as well (see the December Update Details section below for more info)


- An emote interface that allows players to equip Salty, Spicy Ramen, Six Shooter, and Flip Out all at the same time


 - Emote interface improvements are still on the list, and you can expect an update on the development of this system in the New Year

We will continue to revisit and update this list in the weeks and months ahead to keep you up to speed on what we’re working on. Below, you’ll find more specific detail about each of the features and updates you can expect to land in December.


----

**December Update Details**

There are four key areas we’re targeting for improvements in December. Some of these updates will arrive with the **December 5** update, and some additional updates will be included in a patch that will be deployed the following week on **December 12**.

Both updates combined include improvements set against the following goals:

- **Deepen Rewards** for advanced players

- **Provide More Player Control** over obtaining rewards

- **Make Shards Useful** by adding things to use them for

- **Provide General Quality** fixes wherever possible


The following changes are the first steps towards achieving these goals, with more planned for our next release in January. Here is a preview of impending changes to Destiny 2. Each category is marked with a forecast delivery date.

**Masterworks**

[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/104815/11282017_Masterwork_Tooltip.gif)


- **[DEC 12]** Legendary Weapons will drop as or be upgraded to become **Masterworks** versions


 - Masterworks will have a few advantages over the baseline Legendary weapon:

  - Track and display the number of kills with that weapon (with choice between total count or Crucible-only count)
  - Generate orbs for you and your allies on multi-kills
  - Add weapon stat bonuses that are selected randomly from a small pool and are re-rollable
 - Masterworks drop from any source of Legendary weapons for characters above 250 Power

  - Unwanted Masterworks can be dismantled into materials that can upgrade an existing Legendary Weapon into a Masterwork
  - Raid and Trials of the Nine Weapons will have a very high chance to be Masterworks
 - We have future plans to extend Masterworks to other gear and expose your kill counts in more places (e.g. Crucible kill screen)

**Armor Ornaments**
[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/104815/11282017_Iron_Banner.jpg)


- **[DEC 5]** Armor Ornaments will be added to some existing Armor sets for more visual customization without losing your Shaders or Mods


 - These ornaments will be unlocked by completing objectives specific to each set, and are permanently unlocked account-wide, just like Exotic Weapon ornaments
 - They will be applied to the base pieces that you may already have collected, and can now unlock on Vendors if not
 - In Season 2, the following sets have ornaments unlocked in their respective activities:

  - Vanguard Faction Armor
  - Crucible Faction Armor
  - Trials of the Nine Armor
  - Iron Banner Armor
  - Dead Orbit Armor
  - Future War Cult Armor
  - New Monarchy Armor
  - Eater of Worlds Raid Lair Armor

[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/104815/11282017_Crucible.jpg)


- **[DEC 12]** Faction Armor and Weapons will be unlocked for purchase for Legendary Shards and Faction Tokens on most Faction Vendors


 - All five Armor Slots will always be present, and Weapons will rotate weekly on Factions that have them
 - Slots will be unlocked by claiming Reward Engrams from the respective Faction
 - You will get credit for engrams you may have already claimed since launch

[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/104815/11282017_Xur.jpg)


- **[DEC 12]** Xur has some new offerings for players collecting Exotics:


 - Every week, you’ll be able to acquire one of the new Fated Engrams using Legendary Shards that will decrypt as Exotics that aren’t already in your collection
 - A simpler Three of Coins that boosts Exotic drop rates from any source for 4 hours

  - No obscure stacking mechanics or need to re-apply before every boss
  - These cost Legendary Shards and you can have as many as you like

**General Investment**
[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/104815/11282017_Gunsmith.jpg)


- **[DEC 5]** Banshee has some updates on the Weapon and Armor Mod front:


 - For players wanting to clear some Mod inventory space, Rare quality Mods will dismantle into Gunsmith Materials and have a chance to produce Legendary quality Mod Components
 - For players chasing specific Legendary Mods (including Legendary Kinetic Mods), Banshee will offer a selection of specific Legendary Mods for direct purchase, with a selection that will rotate daily and cost Legendary Shards and Mod Components


- **[DEC 5]** For players chasing a world Legendary or looking for Masterworks, Master Rahool will sell some of his rumored hoard of Legendary Engrams for Legendary Shards



- **[DEC 12]** Commander Zavala and Lord Shaxx will sell Gift consumables for Legendary Shards that can be used during a Strike or Crucible Match that will serve the following functions:


 - Grant bonus rewards to everyone in that activity upon completion, friend or foe alike
 - Award anything from Faction Tokens to a round of Exotics for everyone in the match


- **[DEC 12]** Exploit safeguards on Chests and Resource Nodes are greatly relaxed and players should encounter them less frequently


 - Even if they do, drop rates for Tokens is only reduced to 30% instead of 0%, and Glimmer will be unaffected
 - We want to associate a visual indicator with this in a future update, but we weren’t able to pull that off in this update (but we hear you!)


- **[DEC 12]** Vendors will now beckon you to hand in your Reputation Tokens only when you’re carrying enough to earn a Reward Engram



- **[DEC 5]** Changes affecting Reputation Tokens:


 - Daily Challenges will have Reputation Token awards increased across the board
 - Cayde’s Treasure Chests still offer variable rewards, but now guarantee (at minimum) a payout of destination appropriate Reputation Tokens
 - Strikes will drop a larger number of Vanguard Reputation Tokens
 - Common quality Destination Resource Tokens will have their drop rates increased to 100%, and values per Token increased as well (by 50% for common quality Tokens and 250% for rare quality Tokens)
 - On the balance, Reputation required per Reward Engram will increase for Destination Factions (+37%) and Gunsmith (+50%)
 - Leviathan Raid Tokens will be redeemed at Benedict immediately upon obtaining a Token, instead of requiring a full clear before unlocking

With the launch of Curse of Osiris, and the beginning of Season 2, you can expect to see a full suite of patch notes that will document all of the changes outlined above, as well as additional gameplay and sandbox tuning changes the team is making to improve Destiny 2. We’ll also soon be providing pre-load and launch day details, as well as a roadmap for our Season 2 content, which includes The Dawning in mid-December.


----

**XP Mechanics**

Last weekend, we disabled a scaling mechanism that adjusted XP gains up and down without reflecting those adjustments in the UI. Our intention was to keep slower-paced activities as rewarding as high intensity grinding without confusing variations in displayed XP values, but the silent nature of the mechanic betrayed the expectation of transparency that you have for Destiny 2.

We were able to disable the system with a server-side change, but a new solution is now needed to rebalance XP in Destiny 2. We have begun that work, and will continue to provide updates to you about timelines and specifics. The values coded into our website API are being updated today (and may already have been as you read this post) to reflect the removal of this scaling mechanism. In a future update, we intend to link these internal and display-only values together for greater consistency, and to ensure that when changes are made they are accurately reflected everywhere we report them.

We already see that the newly adjusted 160K XP per level value means that leveling is too slow for some activities, and we have begun the process of collecting data and recalibrating XP earn rates to improve them as quickly as possible.

XP boosts, including both consumable items and passive bonuses like the Well Rested 300% bonus, were always applied after this system and never resulted in early slowing of XP. They should be unchanged by the disabling of this system and will continue to provide their stated increase in XP gain.

Expect to see a lot of conversation from our team on this front, as XP rewards are updated and brought back in-line with player expectations.


----

**The Future**

Going forward, we plan to continue this dialog as openly and frequently as possible. This will be an ongoing process, but one that we are committed to.

This week we’ll be publishing a new episode of the Bungie Podcast where we will sound off on the current state of Destiny 2, how we think about our communication challenges, and what it takes to update the game in the wild. You’ll be able to listen on both Apple and Android devices. 

Thank you for playing, for being passionate about the Destiny 2 experience, and for working with us as we look to continuously improve our game and studio communication.

I told him the picture is from the perspective of the moon and the ball over the earth is the traveler.

Just one day  later he called me and said come over here and take a look at the work of art.
„Do you like it?“ I Said yes its awsome and so fast? Wow!

I tried to upload this in community - creations on Bungie.net but it dosen‘t work... the site does not want to upload it.

Edit 2: This post is about how I would like content removed if Bungie decides to remove it, not how large the game is on my hard drive. The reason for the removal could be anything, not necessarily hard drive space.

Say if it was Mercury we could run a bunch of missions into the Infinite Forest to destabilize the Vex operation, followed by one big assault on the Almighty which we then use to rip out the Vex central computer and hurl it into the sun.

Objectives could work like the community challenge did. After a certain number of kills, nightfalls, and strikes the final mission becomes available.

It would make the war against the Darkness feel a little more like a war if there were occasional big operations instead of just a bunch of commando strikes. Plus I think our Guardian deserves their own Twilight Gap or Six Fronts.",2019-09-30 08:58:11

Before that, each faction received a new sparrow and ghost shell. Before that, Heroic Strikes returned to Destiny 2. 

Right now, Destiny 2 is in a regressed state from Destiny 1. The minor improvements in the sequel are vastly overshadowed by the disappointments and missing features from the previous game. 

Bungie has expressed that they are listening to our feedback and are going to fix many issues with the game, issues that were created by the regression of Destiny 1 features/mechanics, things like 6v6 PvP, Exotic Quests, and the balance shifting for Eververse items towards in game progression and activity rewards and away from Bright Engrams. 

These are not fixes that are deserving of hype or praise. They are simply Bungie reselling us features we had in the previous game a second time and calling it ""new"". These are not new. Destiny 2 is not a new game in a new franchise. It is a SEQUEL. It should have included every feature from the previous game, and expanded upon them. I cannot think of a single successful sequel that didn't do this. Many see Destiny 2 as a brand new game, when it isn't. It is a continuation of the Destiny franchise. There is no excuse for removing features, only to return them to the game.

Now instead of that they are doing the opposite. Nerf everything and make us feel weak. I*f they want us to use new/different stuff, then make new strong gear or instead buff old stuff. This is so fucking absurd and I cannot believe the disconnect between Bungie and the community. This is NOT a good first look for Bungie without Activision.*

&#x200B;

Also, these nerfs wont make content harder for the people who are wanting more challenging content--it will just make it slower and more frustrating. Many of us want content that is more demanding on a players skill, strategic ability, precision and problem solving, and these changes do nothing to make that happen. There are numerous design changes that could be implemented to make endgame content challenging, and trying to use these changes as a way to do that is lazy and unimaginative. Trying to act like these changes are the result of a listening dev team that is trying to make the game harder for the hardcore community is unbelievably pathetic, and frustrating. Sorry for venting, its just that some people seemed to get the impression that I want everything to be easy in the game when thats not the case, so I thought I should give my thoughts

I was finished all my powerful engrams, and felt bored.

So, as a ""Kinderguardian Teacher,"" I did as I always do. Booted up Trostland, and looked for new players to help. I helped out a few, but none of them seemed special.

Then, I met HIM.

I sent him my usual message; ""Greetings Guardian! I see you're new here! Would you like some help? etc...""

He said ""Yes please"" and asked how we could group up. I explained how to invite another player, and we got to playing around Trostland.

He invited me to a party, and instantly, I knew this kid wasn't your average kid. He spoke very monotone, and had a stutter to his voice. Me, being a mute, I had to talk through text chat, but he said it was okay.

He introduced himself.

We talked for a while, and eventually, he told me that he was born with Asperger's, ADD, and ADHD, and that he's also adopted, and his adoptive parents  went through a divorce just a few weeks ago.

That's quite a rough combo.

After a bit of chatting, I asked him where his next story mission was. He said there was nowhere else to go, because he only had the trial version of D2, because I couldn't afford the full game. He had just gotten his PS4 for Christmas. 

So, I decided to make this kid's Christmas and New Year's a bit better.

I told him, ""Sit tight about thirty minutes, okay?"" He said okay, and I left for the nearest corner store.

I started a jog.

I made it to the store, and purchased two 50$ PSN cards. I made my way back, and sent him a message to ask if he was still online. He was.

I got back, and prepared a huge message.

""From the bottom of my heart, I wish you a merry Christmas, and a Happy New Year. I hope that your life gets better, because it always will.

Here's my Christmas gift to you. Two 50$ PSN cards. You can use this to buy the complete edition of Destiny 2.

(Code one)

(Code two)""

After reading the message, he broke out into tears. He had never experienced anyone doing something like this before. I told him that the world isn't all that bad, and that there's some genuinely nice people out there. He thanked me.

Now, there was an issue at first. Playstation doesn't allow you to use currencies that aren't from your account's country. So.. I had to make a compromise.

I created a new account for him, under my country. 

I made him a Dredgen.

He loved the name. I went on a spiel about all the lore surrounding the name Dredgen, and he loved the sound of the story. (I've seriously gotta send him he entire story, I think he'll love it.)

I loaded the codes onto the account, and purchased the Complete edition of D2, and 500 silver, since there was leftover money.

Then, I customized the account with a custom profile picture, cover image, and bio.

After I was finished, I sent him the info for the account. He hopped on, and created a new character. It wasn't a big deal to him that he was losing his old save, since he only had one character, and they were at level 5.

I wondered what else I could do for him.

Ah! I put us into the refer a friend program, and also into my clan, so he'd get EVEN more stuff.

He thanked me, multiple times. I told him it was no problem, but he had to promise me one thing; whenever he sees someone in need, he needs to go out of his way to help them. Pay it forwards.

He agreed, and we played for a little while before he had to go to bed.

I said goodnight, and then we parted ways.

I intend on playing with him a lot. I've made a great new friend.

I empathized with him. I've lived a rough family life, too, and know how it can make you feel. But it always gets better. You just need to see it so.

Thank you for reading, Guardians. Happy New Year.

Edit; I don't mean for this post to come off as bragging. I'm just trying to share the story of a troubled kid who needed some love in his life.

> Destiny 2 keeps making the same mistakes as Destiny 1.
> From its September debut until now, Destiny 2 has managed some sort of quantum trick: it’s simultaneously superior to its predecessor in a hundred obvious and subtle ways, while also repeating almost every one of the first game’s launch-year failings, sometimes to the letter. It’s understandable that Bungie would want to cut away the many bandage-like auxiliary systems they added to Destiny over three years. They’d want to do that in order to launch a game with a sturdier foundation, something they can build on in new and exciting ways over the years to come. It’s less understandable why they would still fail to communicate with their players to the degree they have, or why the game would still hide crucial systems and calculations, forcing players to figure out for themselves that the XP system is invisibly throttling them, or a new exotic buff item isn’t working as intended.
> 
> Personally speaking, I like Destiny 2. I appreciate the numerous ways Bungie has managed to improve the game over the last few weeks. Despite a rough winter, I’m still optimistic that it’ll become a better and better game over the months and years to come. But it’s remarkable how closely the sequel’s meta-narrative has matched the narrative of the first game, up to and including the disappointing winter expansion and Bungie’s continual unforced communication errors. It was exhausting the first time around, and it’s incalculably more so to do it all over again.

______________________

Hey there, Guardians. This is not meant to be a stab at Bungie nor negative in any way. I see the potential in the areas where I feel Destiny 2 lacks, and I would like to try and express that potential. Sorry in advance for the long post. [HERE](https://i.imgur.com/OJ4jsiK.jpg) is an instant link to the image.

It is blatantly obvious that Destiny 2 has taken a huge step in terms of making level-based vendors a primary feature in the game. Whether it is a PvE or PvP activity, there is a vendor associated with it along with their corresponding tokens. These tokens are thrown at us left and right no matter what we do. Twenty tokens later we are rewarded with an engram, we hope for the best and the cycle continues. Level up a vendor enough and these engram contents begin to mean nothing. Lets actually take a look at the definition of vendor,

**vendor** - a person or company offering something for sale, especially a trader in the street.


So are those rank-up engrams ""for sale?"" I only ask this because most of the vendors you rank up are not necessarily selling anything else. Unless you count a strip of uncommon gear that becomes irrelevant past 200 power or the option to re-buy a quest item. Many, such as Zavala, Ikora, Rahool, and Saladin do not even have one item for sale: 
>*Sorry, there are no items available here. Please check back during a future visit to see if there is any new inventory.* 

Unfortunately, this is a big step back from the first game in the franchise. 

I am aware that a few vendors do have items for sale such as Cayde and Tess. However, they are not necessarily the same as the kind you rank up (actually, the Gunsmith is a big exception to this with his mod services). Which brings me to my next point. The API shows that vendor/faction ranks are tracked. It is fascinating to me how these cumulative ranks are no longer shown and no longer serve any purpose.

This is where ideas begin buzzing around in my head. So I got permission from our boy Devrim to do a complete rank-based mockup and overhaul of his vendor inventory. Each and every item will be explained below the image link. Below the item descriptions will be some final notes on the idea. Much of it is very conceptual with the goal of expanding the game in numerous ways. Anyway, lets do this:

_______________
###[VENDOR REWORK - DEVRIM KAY (IMAGE)](https://i.imgur.com/OJ4jsiK.jpg)
_______________

**RANK 5**

* *Dead Zone Bark* - On the off chance anyone wants this shader. Cost: 1000 glimmer.

* *Dead Zone Foliage* - See above.

* *(New) EDZ Emblem* - I used an old EDZ emblem as an example here. However, it'd be nice to have one as a symbol of hitting rank 5 (free).

* *Random EDZ Mods* - Purchase these for one random armor or weapon mod with an EDZ-related perk. Example: chest mod that provides extra grenade damage in the EDZ or class item mod that give additional loot from EDZ public events. Cost: 2000 glimmer, 3 dusklight shards.
_______________

**RANK 10**

* *EDZ Ship* - A gorgeous EDZ ship with some nice lore and a transmat effect tied in. Cost: 15000 glimmer

* *Some new class item* - Used the wildwood cloak as an example. However it'd be nice to get a nice EDZ class item. This will ideally have EDZ-based perks on it to help with continuing to rank up. Cost: 7500 glimmer, 10 dusklight shards

* *Rank 10 Emblem* - Ideally another nice new emblem to show you like the EDZ enough to hit rank 10. Or an emote, who knows.

* *Devrim's Gift* - A sniper (maybe his No Land Beyond?) that can be purchased from Devrim as a reward for hitting rank 10. This sniper will have unique perks specific to the EDZ. Example: Stacking headshot bonus while killing Fallen in EDZ. Cost: 7500 glimmer, 10 legendary shards (or maybe a little questline?)
_______________

**RANK 15**

* *EDZ Sparrow* - A nifty sparrow that has additional perks when being used in the EDZ.

* *Legendary Shaders* - Get one of two random legendary EDZ shaders. Ideally looking better than the uncommon ones. Cost: 5000 glimmer, 5 dusklight shards.

* *Heroic Sector Keys* - Refer to my previous concept, [HEROIC SECTORS](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/72okc0/heroic_sectors_a_fleshed_out_mockup_and_idea_of/), to understand what these would be. Only 3 per week can be purchased. Cost: 10000 glimmer, 5 legendary shards.

* *Random EDZ Mods (legendary)* - Presumably same as the aforementioned rare mods except with +5 power. Or maybe some very unique mods, who knows. Cost: 5000 glimmer, 10 dusklight shards
_______________

**RANK 20** 

* *Mystic EDZ Engrams* - Decode one of these for one piece of Mystic EDZ gear (armor or weapon). The mystic EDZ gear has very specific and unique perks that help a guardian who is playing in the EDZ. Full set and weapons are synergistic. Cost: 25000 glimmer, 10 legendary shards, 25 dusklight shards. (Or perhaps a less hefty price and a weekly cap)

* *Random EDZ Aura* - Get one random aura that has an EDZ buff and a related effect. Example: aura that increases agility and jump height in the EDZ for a 30 minutes. Cooldown on use is 1 hour. Cost: 20000 glimmer, 10 legendary shards. NOTE: Auras are so underutilized have have a lot of potential!

* *Mystic EDZ Shell* - A ghost shell much better than the uncommon version that gives significant EDZ-based perks. Cost: 7500 glimmer, 5 legendary shards
_______________

**RANK 25**

* *Exotic Quest* - Exotic quest is unlocked. Times are happy.

* *Exotic Emblem* - Perhaps animated? One final reward to show your dedication to the EDZ.
________________________

**RESOURCES**

* *Dusklight Extractor* - A handy tool that can be purchased and consumed to increase chances of harvesting additional dusklight for 30 minutes. Cooldown is also 30 minutes. Cost: 3000 glimmer.

* *EDZ Fortune Coin* - Consume this to increase chances of special rewards from public events and lost/heroic sectors for 30 minutes. Cooldown is 1 hour. Cost: 7500 glimmer. 

* *MIDA Mini Tool* - Had to find some place for it.

**Final Notes and Thoughts**

So I just wanted to remind that this is completely conceptual. I am in no way saying that this idea is perfect. I am aware that the prices of the items or the level scaling I used may be unbalanced. It is impossible to know without testing. My ultimate goal was to create an in-depth reason to grind out vendors in the endgame. The rework I created for Devrim can in theory apply to any vendor, not just the planetary ones. 

Not only this, I wanted to emphasize the idea of making one's time in an activity or patrol area dynamic, evolving over time. This is through the many perks/mods on the ""EDZ"" gear awarded over time. The more time you spend in the EDZ, the more powerful you'll end up becoming on there because of the gear set. If this was applied to multiple vendors, it would give players a reason to dynamically switch around their gear and perks. Nightfall on Io this week? Then put on some of that special Io gear you earned for some extra perks. This can make flashpoints all the more enjoyable too

There are some other minor things I tried to improve upon such as the usage of dusklight shards as a currency instead of reputation fuel.

I didn't want to impose too much on Bungie's system, so this was created with the assumption that the rank-up engrams/tokens would remain the same.

Replace the rewards and vendor items I used with your own ideas. This one of so many possibilities on how vendors, the most apparent part of our game, could be improved. Any feedback is appreciated. I enjoy doing these mockups, so as long as it is well received, I may end up doing more. Oh and if you enjoyed this, please check out the my [HEROIC SECTORS](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/72okc0/heroic_sectors_a_fleshed_out_mockup_and_idea_of/) concept.

D2 is a good case study of why there was never a World of Warcraft 2.,12358,77ehnm,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/77ehnm/d2_is_a_good_case_study_of_why_there_was_never_a/,2410,1508449795.0,"You've cut players off from all of the wonderful content that was introduced in D1 for no real perceivable (to the player) benefit or reason.  All the raids and strikes from D1 should be available to the D2 player base.  

This really should have just been an expansion onto an ever improving Destiny experience.  Look at WoW.  No other MMORPG can compete based solely on the vast amount of content alone.  So many supposed ""WoW killers"" have come and gone.  Why?  Because they can't match the content and polish that took YEARS to develop in WoW.  

With Destiny 2, you cut everyone off from the content and QoL improvements of D1.  This is absurd.  It won't be hard to create a Destiny killer if you continue to reboot every few years and amputate it from previous content.

I suggest Bungie finds a way to (at the very least) bring in all the D1 raids, strikes and crucible modes into D2 if they want true longevity.  

**Update**  Thanks to everyone for being civil.  I never thought this post would blow up like this (for me this is blowing up at least).  I know that it's not a 1 for 1 comparison but there are definite parallels to be drawn and I think the vast majority of you got my point.  And just to clarify, I really enjoy Destiny 2.  For PC holdouts, you'll definitely get your money's worth.  I don't want to scare you away.  ",2017-10-20 05:49:55

> ""How is this a 'new direction' or 'new foundation' for a game that has been out for years, I am tired of it.""

> ""Destiny has been out for 5 years and they still can't get it right."" 

> ""I am tired of giving them second chances.""

> ""I had to wait to log in on release day! WTF Bungie!""

> ""This is rediculous, Bungie clearly has no idea what they are doing.""

> ""Same shit, different day.""

And if you try to respond to any of it with any amount of praise, you get called a sheep. Guess what, I am not a sheep. I am just not blinded by my petty rage and have sat through this entire godforsaken journey with Bungie. I have watched them struggle. I have watched them get chewed out into the ground, and I was sometimes the one doing the chewing. I have given them praise where praise was due and I gave and accepted criticisms for the game all while the fair-weather on and off players bitched from the sidelines.

Watching as a studio dropped their AAA publisher, migrated all of their data on PC to a completely different platform, coordinated and implemented cross-save, and then began acting independently unlike every other dev who gets in bed with the devil and makes a shit game, yeah. It is a new foundation. It is a completely new start. The amount of content and QoL improvements made in this expansion alone are massively impressive on not only a technical but a consumer experience scale. I am not ""forgiving them"" or handing out baseless empathy/pity - I am standing up for what a kick ass fucking job they did making **my experience** absolutely awesome.

Bungie separating from Activision and saying fuck you to their money and their support studios that were there to push the publisher's agenda was the biggest disrupt in gaming since Kojima left Konami and went independent. If you don't understand the scale of what they went through and put into their absolute passion project **just to make us, the player, happy...** then the artistry in gaming is completely lost on you and you need a reality check.

There is a difference between being an asshole and giving negative criticism, and there is a difference between being a sheep and giving positive criticism. Look at the reality of what just happened for this game and choose if you are going to be an asshole, a sheep, or a critic.

**Final Word:** Post got pretty crazy and I can't enjoy Destiny while keeping up with everyone, but thanks everyone for your responses, good or bad. Apologies if I didn't finish our conversation, debate, circle jerk, or pissing match but it is just getting hard to track down responses. Going to close with some general responses:

* No I do not think Bungie cares about me, Joe, personally, but I do think they care about me as one of the many players who participate in their work.

* No I am not providing PR for Bungie, nor do I work for Bungie. I'm a 30 year old dad who works in infrastructure and security at a conglomerate that just purchased the company I have worked for, for 8 years. I know what buyouts, acquisitions, and investors mean to businesses and an employee’s outlook on the future. It’s fucking scary. If u/cozmo23 or u/dmg04 need to confirm that for you, I will leave that to them.

* Yes I have criticized this game many, many times before and I have another post about there being no Y1 armor in the world loot pool on the front page of this sub right now. I am not afraid to criticize art, it's why it exists. Video games, to me, are a combination of computers, programming, and art.

Love this community, even the parts I don't generally care for, and it's obvious I love this game. [The dark horse rides toward the light](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aV4x5DsES9w), be there to defend it.",2019-10-04 10:09:50

My career was in high-tech and I have played video games since the time of Pong and Pac Woman!   I loved the original Doom and Quake, but stopped playing video games quite a few years ago (might have had something to do with raising my son)...  


I did try Fallout -- a few of them -- and while I enjoyed them I didn't like them half has much as D2.  I really enjoy this game!     


I have avoided Gambit and Crucible though -- cause I absolutely stink at PVP.    I guess my reflexes aren't what they once were!

Edited to add that my son introduced me to Reddit, too.  He's very good to me!",2019-06-25 13:15:12

A machine used to simulate everything.  USE IT PLEASE.  A fire team of 3 runs through the Infinite Forest and kills enemies to fill up a progress bar.  Once that progress bar fills up to 100%, we get teleported to a random boss encounter.  These bosses could be any Strike boss we've encountered so far in the games history...

Aksor/Nixis, Valus Ta’aurc, Psion Flayers, Hive Abomination / Phogoth, Alak-hul, Sepiks Perfected, Taniks, Undying Mind, SABRE-2, Malok, Theosyion, Sekrion, Bond Brothers, Omnigul, Kovik and his Ogre Abomination, Protheon (Destiny 2), Brakion (Destiny 2), Savathun's Song Shrieker (Destiny 2), Thaviks (Destiny 2), Bracus Zahn (Destiny 2), Grask (Destiny 2)...

Teleport us to the start of those boss encounters in the corresponding strike.  When we take them down...give us the loot 'splosion.  This would be an INCREDIBLE PvE GOLDMINE OF CONTENT.  Yes, it is Diablo 3's Rift system more or less, but put your own spin on it with the Infinite Forest Daemons to unlock the next level of the Forest, Heroic Modifiers or something of the sort. 

EDIT:  Thanks for the upvotes guys!  There's so many different things they could come up with surrounding the Infinite Forest...I just thought that something like this could really go a LOOONG way towards giving us reasons to play.  Perhaps with the upcoming expanded masterworks and mod system, they could tie some sort of material into completing this activity that we can use towards making mods or masterworks items...

EDIT # 2: HOLY CRAP guys...8 hours of sleep and 8 hours of work later and this exploded!  Thanks so much for looking and contributing to the suggestion/discussion...we need Bungie to look at things like this.

For those of you that offered relationship advise, I really appreciate it and am happy to see that our community is so willing to help out a fellow guardian if they feel they are in need of guidance. And for those who finished reading my post and saw that I already made my decision, my hats off to you for getting to join in with me on a funny way to handle a serious situation.

Now I know a lot of people are curious as to what happened and what I decided to do. Well I'm here to bring some closure to the story. I ended up deciding to do both Iron banner and Trials. I got 2 of my characters up to rank 5 in Iron Banana and got some sweet distant stars. Then had some rough compotation in trials and only made it to 7 all weekend. It was a pretty emotionally devastating weekend to say the least. Trials and I have always had a love hate relationship which I don't think will ever change.

Well I hope that cleared a few things up for people and brought them some much needed closure! Good luck out there guardians and happy hunting!

Summary:

**CoO in General** 

CoO meets the requirements on some levels by adding in new story missions and new locations. But it also gates players out of older systems and generally makes it impossible to continue playing the game without buying the expansion, and with that it feels a little bit like a subscription service: if you want to play Destiny 2 in any genuine way, you sort of have to buy the expansion. But that's old hat. Destiny 2 represented a major push towards making money off of micro-transactions, something which sat at the periphery but didn't really bother me in the original release. With Curse of Osiris, however, I'm starting to feel it creep into the rest of the game and poison my experience.

...

**Comsetics**

Cosmetics in the original Destiny were a key part of player progression even if they didn't effect gameplay -- I spent dozens of hours questing after that ship from King's Fall not because it would make my player stronger but because I wanted it: it was proof of where I had been and what I had done. When I equipped that creepy glowing shader everyone knew I had gotten it from Crota's End.  Destiny has been a collection game from the start, but chasing a big, shiny collection just doesn't feel as rewarding when so many of the elements of that collection are purchased with real money.

For me, locking the ships behind Eververse have had the opposite of the intended effect: I just go with the the old, busted ship you get in the campaign because it's the only ship in the game with any connection to my character's story.

I was optimistic about Eververse when it first landed. Bungie mostly used it as a way to sell emotes, which were unavailable through any other sort of play in the original Destiny. Emotes were fun and weird, straddling the line between game and reality: they felt like the perfect deployment of the inevitably fourth wall-breaking micro-transaction system. Things crept forward, however, into all the myriad places where we see them today. And it's begun to really cut into those core gameplay loops of progression and collection that can make the game so satisfying when deployed well. New content should always mean new loot, but I want the $20 I paid at the gate to cover the lion's share of that new loot.

A small clan of deaf gamers just beat Calus for the first time. How awesome is that?,11079,78wvb8,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/78wvb8/a_small_clan_of_deaf_gamers_just_beat_calus_for/,575,1509065480.0,"Background: One of the guys was in our clan, and is still in Discord chat with us and plays with us. However, after joining our clan he founded an all-deaf clan called [DESTINYERRORALWAYSFAMOUS \[DEAF\]](https://www.bungie.net/en/ClanV2?groupId=2101613). It's a small clan (only 11 members), but they're all deaf and they use Glide to communicate with each other. 

Now, as I mentioned these people aren't just doing random activities in Destiny that require little to no communication (e.g. public events, strikes, story missions, etc). No, these guys actually raid together. Think about that: Destiny raids require a fair bit of communication to pull off. Imagine trying to beat Oryx (which they did after 3 months of trying), but not being able to use your voice. Who's taken? Oh, the guy that used the dance emote. 

Imagine trying to beat Calus, but not being able to tell people which sign is on his forehead. How do you get around that? Well, the answer is using Glide and quickly putting in a message saying which sign is there. The home guy responsible for punching bubbles would have to pay close attention to the texting of any A (Axe), S (Sun), D (Dog), and C (Chalice) from the away team. If the home guy sees A, D, and C, he would punch S bubble and has to stay alive for next round of texting. Can you imagine doing Calus like that? I sure can't, but these guys are owning it.

So, fellow guardians, let's all raise our salt shakers to a truly hardcore group of deaf guardians who are not letting their lack of hearing keep them from enjoying all of the content that Destiny has to offer. CanHazChzbrger and your deaf clan, you truly are an inspiration!

edit: Great to see such positivity here! FYI, one of the guys in the clan posted and it sounds like [they'll be attempting it again tonight and streaming it on mixer](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/78wvb8/a_small_clan_of_deaf_gamers_just_beat_calus_for/doxlbrh/)!

Any stance other than 'We do not allow DDOS strategies in our game' is completely unacceptable.

"After 86 Gambit matches, I figured out the Malfeasance boss spawn. Here's how you can get on my level",10872,9krhhi,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/9krhhi/after_86_gambit_matches_i_figured_out_the/,1012,1538522126.0,"I figured out how to force the spawn through skill and practice. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to get on my level, and get the boss to spawn for you:

Step 1) Kill countless high-value targets and the non-glowing yellow bars that spawn in the subsequent 3 or more waves, to no effect.

Step 2) Play more than 86 matches or less than 86 matches.

Step 3) Around match 50, leave your PS4 and stress-eat a yogurt in the kitchen while you're AFK 1v4 against a clan wondering why matchmaking didn't bother putting 3 other guys on your team for, like, the 20th time. Explain the Gambit mechanics to your cat while she freaks out because she can't tell the difference between a yogurt cup and a can of cat food.

Step 4) Lose count of how many matches you've played, and notice you somehow have a level 34 guy on your team versus a clanned 4-stack. Notice another guy on your team is seemingly jumping into the lava on purpose each time he gets 10-15 motes. Know that this will be the Malfeasance spawn, so sit up straight and frantically search for special and heavy ammo that you can't find anywhere.

Step 5) When the Malfeasance spawns for the first time like you knew it would, don't even try because it's essentially 2v4 and you only have primary ammo. Invade over and over out of spite and somehow constantly get team-wipes with your Go Figure, even though you never got them once before. Shoot primary ammo at the Malfeasance boss because you have to pass the time while the other team gets their Exotic quest because they have 4 players and you have a level 34 guy and can't even see the lava-jumper on the map when you look for him. Keep shooting primary ammo at the boss with just one other guy.

Step 6) Hear the re-skinned Servitor's shriek/explosion noises and see that, somehow, you got the Malfeasance quest.

Step 7) Be the best player in all of Destiny because your dedication and skill spawned the boss through challenging-but-rewarding mechanics on which you were able to make direct, tangible progress.

Other things I've skilled my way into in Destiny and Destiny 2:

* Dropping my first Black Hammer after 68 Crota kills
* Getting the Ghost Ghost from Eververse loot boxes after paying $25
* Getting the last piece of gear I needed to hit level 30 from Vault of Glass, long after the Dark Below released and level 30 wasn't the cap anymore
* Never even getting close to the Imago Loop Fatebringer roll after running the strike literally over 100 times
* Not getting my first Exotic this expansion until I was 575, and it was an Armamentarium that was somehow lower light than my current chest piece
* Dropping more snipers with Hip Fire Grip than Edge Transits (I kept track of it)
* Waiting 5-6 hours (actually) for the Taken Blight to spawn for the first time on Io so I could do the Whisper quest that I skipped when I was burnt out during Warmind

Follow this guide, and you too can get the Malfeasance boss to spawn through practice, skill, and having your time respected.",2018-10-03 07:15:26

[https://imgur.com/mB7yp67](https://imgur.com/mB7yp67)

&#x200B;

I've seen for a while the noticeable impact that the reddit community has on Bungie, and the changes they make to Destiny.

In the hopes to fix some of the (few) things that have bugged me since Forsaken came out, I spent some of my free time from the last couple of days  thinking about some changes to Xûr that would (hopefully) fix how boring of a vendor he is right now, while at the same time help with some other issues like the Masterwork core economy and Exotic drop chances. I also created some mock ups for you guys so you get an idea of how I visualize it.

**I know**  Bungie addressed these concerns in this week's TWAB, this is just the way *I see* it would be easier for them to (help) fix them all at once.

***Disclaimer:***

*- I'm NOT a Game Developer, but I do go to school for Game Development & Design. The guys at Bungie are* ***professionals*** *of the industry, and I'm not pretending to know more than them by suggesting any of these changes. But I do understand better than most players what it takes to develop a video game and why Bungie do the things the way they do. I used my knowledge to address multiple concerns of the community while thinking of a simple/fast way that Bungie could implement very quickly.*

\&#x200B;

So let's start with some Goals, the way Bungie does it:

# Goals

* **Make Xûr a much more interesting vendor.**
* **Give players something exciting to look forward to every weekend.**
* **Give players more ways to earn Masterwork Cores.**
* **Create an incentive for players to use different Exotic Weapons.**
* **Create a guaranteed (Hard) way to earn an Exotic engram every week, with a High chance of rewarding a new Exotic.**
* **Give invested players with a surplus of Masterwork cores a new way to spend them.**

# Plan [\[CHECK EXAMPLE\]](https://imgur.com/mB7yp67)

**4 New Weekly Bounties offered by Xûr**

* 3 Bounties that reward Masterwork cores (6 total, but only 3 offered every week)
* 1 Bounty that rewards an Exotic (2 or 3 total, but only 1 offered every week)

**3 New Consumables offered by Xûr (Can only buy 1 per character \[or account\] and only 2 offered every week)**

* Consumable to ease the grind of Nightfall specific Loot.
* Consumable to ease the grind of Exotic Catalysts and Masterwork Cores in Strikes and Crucible matches.
* Consumable to increase the chance to get “Curated” Masterwork Rolls.

# BOUNTIES [\[CHECK EXAMPLE 1\]](https://imgur.com/qGhWIMp) [\[CHECK EXAMPLE 2\]](https://imgur.com/zPAiVxm)

**EXOTIC BOUNTIES (1 per character, per week)** [\[CHECK EXAMPLE\]](https://imgur.com/qGhWIMp)

1. **Master Cryptographer (Cost: 50,000 Glimmer)**
   1. Accumulate 150 Points by acquiring Engrams in the wild. Rare Engrams count for 1, Legendary Engrams for 3 and Exotic Engrams for 10.
      1. *Rewards: (Powerful) Exotic Gear*

Info: Has a 50% chance of giving you an Exotic you do not have.

*Bounty Expires in 7 days.*

2.  **Never Tired (Cost: 50,000 Glimmer)**

1. Accumulate 150,000 XP by completing activities. XP from Bounties don’t count. All XP bonuses and multipliers are disable for this bounty.
   1. *Rewards: (Powerful) Exotic Gear*

Info: Has a 50% chance of giving you an Exotic you do not have.

*Bounty Expires in 7 days.*

**For this bounty, XP would be calculated the following way:**

&#x200B;

|Activity Completed|XP Rewarded|
|:-|:-|
|Public Event|1,000|
|Heroic Public Event|1,500|
|Crucible Match (W/L)|(2,000/1,000)|
|Competitive Crucible Match (W/L)|(3,000/1,500)|
|Adventure|2,000|
|Heroic Adventure|3,000|
|Strike|5,000|
|Gambit Match|5,000|
|Nightfall|7,500|
|Raid Encounter|10,000|

XP rewarded is based on length and difficulty of the activity. In perspective, you would have to complete 150 public events, OR 15 Raid Encounters; to complete the Exotic Bounty. Does it sound fair for an Exotic?

&#x200B;

**MASTERWORK BOUNTIES (3 per character, per week)** [\[CHECK EXAMPLE\]](https://imgur.com/zPAiVxm)

# Consumables [\[CHECK EXAMPLE\]](https://imgur.com/kUswzdF)

1. **Uncharged Skeleton Key \[2.0\] (Cost: 25 Masterwork Cores)** [\[CHECK EXAMPLE\]](https://imgur.com/kUswzdF)

*Description: Once fully charged, it can be consumed to get a Nightfall specific reward on the next Nightfall completion.*

**What does it do?**

1. Needs to be charged by accumulating 500,000 points on different Nightfall strikes.
2. If used to get a Nightfall exclusive weapon, the weapon has a high chance (50%) to come fully Masterworked.
3. This item goes in the *Pursuits* tab. Can only hold 1 at a time.

*Because of its cost (25 MW cores), it should be a consumable aimed for invested players who are struggling to get the drop they want. The idea here is to make it similar to the cache key from Escalation Protocol, but with a much more demanding way to charge. Players can only hold 1 at a time per character. And it's High chance for a “curated” roll should make it an interesting purchase for players who already have all Nightfall exclusive drops.*

&#x200B;

**2. Seeker’s Atlas (Cost: 25 Masterwork Cores)**

*Description: A map for Guardians looking for the most hidden treasures of the system.*

**What does it do?**

1. After consuming, every Strike/Crucible match completion has a 10% chance to reward Masterwork Cores (bundles of 2-5) or an Exotic Catalyst (50/50 with the MW cores bundle).
2. Staying in the Strike/Crucible Playlist increases the chance by 2% after every match.
3. After completing 20 Strikes/Crucible matches in a row, the chance is capped at 50%.
4. Can hold a Max of 5 in your consumables inventory.
5. The effect lasts for 8 hours.
   1. *Which is considered a* *long* *play session*

*This consumable is aimed for players that want to invest their time in the strike/crucible playlist and be rewarded for their streak (like we could in Destiny 1). For a moderate cost, players can increase their chance of getting those extremely rare Exotic catalysts that drop only from strikes or the crucible. If they already have all of the catalysts, then this would be a way to farm Masterwork cores. Remember that with this consumable, it is a 10% chance of getting either MW cores or the Exotic Catalyst (50/50), so the actual chance for the Catalyst is 5%, and after 5 strikes it is 10% . I know for some this might seem either too potent or not potent enough for the cost, but the idea is to keep things rare, while allowing players that can invest their time, to make their farm less stressful.*

*On a side note*\*, even without this consumable, a Strike playlist streak should increase the amount of tokens, planetary materials and Glimmer rewarded. Just saying.\*

**3. Baryon Clover (Cost: 20 Masterwork Cores)**

*Description: An extremely rare species that can be found in the most energy filled places of the Dreaming City. Awokens lucky enough to find one of these treat them as lucky charms.*

**What does it do?**

1. After consuming, players have an increased chance to find fully Masterworked weapons (curated rolls) on the activities that drop them.
2. The chance is actually double of what it is, depending on the activity.
3. The effect lasts for 4 hours or until the player gets one dropped.

*I’m not 100% sure if there is a need to increase the chance for “curated” rolls to drop. I’ve gotten 4 of them so far, 3 from the Raid and 1 from the Dreaming City. But I might’ve been lucky.*

*Regardless, this would be another consumable offered by Xûr so players that have the resources (MW cores) and want to somehow increase their farming chances, then this would be an available option.*

# Answers to Possible FAQs

* Why not include Bounties and XP multipliers for the ""Never Tired"" Exotic Bounty?
   * Because that would ""force"" players to save all of their bounties and the *Well Rested* buff until they get the Bounty from Xûr. Basically what happened in Destiny 1 with the Nightfall buff, which Bungie ended up taking away.
* Why XP and acquiring Engrams for the Exotic bounties and not a more specific task?
   * Because these are the 2 things that players get just by playing the game without noticing at any activity. The exact amount of engrams and XP should be tuned by Bungie because they know better than anyone what is ""too much"" or ""too easy"" for the general player base.
* Why 50% for a new Exotic and not 100%?
   * It would make it a guarantee way to get ALL Exotics. That would be too good. The kind of good that we *think* we want, but we really don't.
* Why all of the Masterwork bounties require to use specific Exotics?
   * This is made on purpose. Even when we have a meta for PvE (Whisper and Sleeper) and PvP (Ace, Chaperone, etc..), the idea is to incentivize players to use different guns from the Exotic arsenal, even if its just for a couple of hours to complete these bounties.
* What if I don't own the Exotic I need for the bounty?
   * You skip it, and wait for next week.
* Should all of the bounties cost only Glimmer? and why that much?
   * The exact amount, again, should be tuned by Bungie. This is just my best guess of what seems *fair* for the reward. Maybe add some Legendary marks to the cost.
* Why are these consumables so expensive?
   * They are endgame items, aimed for invested players that have spare MW cores and want to greatly reduce the stress of some grinds. (I'm really, really, really tired of running 100k-200k Nightfalls and not getting anything..)
* What about the conditions of the consumables, aren't some of them too generous?
   * Those are my best *fair* guesses, exact values should be tuned by Bungie. But I'd always rather have them be really expensive, but useful.. Than cheap and basically useless or unnoticeable.

"On Power, Balance, and Commitment Issues.",10604,757x6s,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/757x6s/on_power_balance_and_commitment_issues/,2162,1507569381.0,"This is going to be a text wall, so get comfortable and grab a drink if you're prepared to blow 30 minutes obsessing over Destiny. These are my thoughts, nothing more.

**1. Power level.**

Power level is not a good thing at all. Light level was sloppy in Destiny 1, and they preserved problems from Destiny 1 while introducing new ones. 

Destiny 1 light levels made it possible to under-level but not to over-level, which makes it feel like your character never gets more powerful. You get ""less weak,"" but never ""stronger."" This is also true in Destiny 2. Power level isn't used as a requirement for equipping new weaponry, so gear strength and power level also aren't related. You also don't gain more health or deal more damage. Power level does nothing.

And on top of this, you now can level to 305 through patrolling and just doing public events. Being max level in Destiny 1 during most of its expansions meant you had completed a good amount of the endgame content - but now, ""endgame"" content is trivialized by design - it's not an important part of the road to the strongest character. High level content is far less ""worthwhile"" as a result.

On top of that issue, you don't need 305 *for* anything. As of next Tuesday, level 300 will be useful for the prestige raid and the prestige nightfall. We already know that the Prestigious Nightfall does not give you unique loot (the aura does not count, sorry), and the prestigious raid is looking to follow a relatively similar suit.

So to summarize, you can get 305 *from* anything, you don't need it *for* anything, and it doesn't *do* anything. It's too easy to level, yet simultaneously not worth it to even try anyway. It's clumsily tacked on to the game.

**And that is a problem.**

The one thing that power level manages to do is spin a narrative that there's more to do after level 20. The mere existence of power level suggests that an endgame exists in which getting your power to the maximum level is valuable. Why would power level exist if you didn't need it for something? Why is it the most prominently displayed number on your emblem?

But by the end of the story you're level 210ish, and there are a grand total of 4 activities that require a higher level: Trials, raids, nightfalls, and the quest exotics - the loot from these activities is not enough of a strength-game-changer to feel like a meaningful payoff for leveling. Feel free to tell me otherwise with a good example.

So in short, power level gives the impression that there will be an endgame, but the current setup of the game does not deliver on that impression. 

I believe this is the critical reason that so many players on reddit are disappointed with the current state of affairs. Power level, the single most RPGish element in Destiny 2, is shallow to the point of total hollowness. Power level encourages you to keep leveling like you're building to a greater goal, but there isn't a payoff.

**Solutions?**

Option 1: Depth.

Games like Skyrim and Dark Souls succeed massively as RPGs even though they are very different. Both allow you access to new abilities and weapons as you level up. Your character gains more health, can use heavier and harder hitting weapons, your fireball spell graduates to a full-on meteor, you can wear stronger armor (cough), new quest activities become available, and there might even be completion awards. The effect combines to make you *feel* strong and more accomplished because you *are* stronger and more accomplished.

Destiny 2 uses levels are minimum requirements for activities instead and I don't think that's wrong, but it does need more depth than that. Why don't we get more health as we level up? Why don't we get more damage with higher attack guns? Why can't we overlevel for *any* activities? Why don't great guns require high power levels, and why aren't there great guns anyway - or at least, why isn't endgame gear *clearly* better than ""I've almost finished the campaign"" gear? Why don't we unlock better abilities past level 12?

Aside from addressing all of these questions with satisfying answers, the fundamental question that needs to be asked at Bungie's studio is ""why does power level exist?"" As far as I can tell the only thing it ""adds"" to the game right now is gameplay hour padding.

Option 2: Shallowness.

Many seem to think Bungie wants to cater to the casuals, and maybe they are right, so here's suggestion #2: *embrace shallowness*. Cut power level out of the equation entirely! If we hit level 20 and gained access to every endgame activity, power level would no longer be a needless distraction that gives nagging suggestions of the endgame, which is severely underdeveloped. We wouldn't *expect* more.

This is not a satirical suggestion. Simplifying mechanics that don't add to a feeling of completeness or otherwise polish the experience of playing is a reasonable way to address them.

**2. Balance.**

Balance, on its own, is not a valuable thing. Pong is a flawlessly balanced game, how many people consider pong a masterpiece of gaming? If, in order to achieve balance, you have to sacrifice creativity and diversity and uniqueness, then balance is not worth achieving, and all it will do is suck the soul out of your game.

As a second example, how do you *really* balance snipers? They can be fired at an enemy from so far away that the enemy can't fire back. They are, by design, a weapon with the specific goal of *imbalance* in mind. Do you really use a sniper with the hope that you're going to have a ""fair fight"" with someone? No, you're trying to knock their face off before they can fire back. Just about everyone loves sniping and just about everyone hates getting sniped. Point being: imbalance  can be fun - you just have to ensure counter-play exists.

Let's go over a few key areas balance is not so great.

*Crucible.*

All abilities and guns had to be proportionally toned down so that each of the archetypes and subclasses couldn't have too much advantage over the others. This results in, *IN MY OPINION*, stale gameplay that by and far does not create opportunities for exciting moments.

There's no killstreaks like call of duty, there's no rankings like overwatch, there's no custom games like halo, what is the point? Why tune things so much to balance crucible and not justify it somehow?

If you really want balance in the crucible, why doesn't Shaxx just give us a choice of permissible weapon loadouts in competitive?

The big question on this one: would you rather have people complain something is unfair or that it is *boring*?

I don't want to further address this, so I'll just end on my take, which is that imbalance in favor of chaos (6v6, faster movement, stronger guns) is more in tune with the whole immortal-space-magic theme that makes Destiny unique. Alternatively, balance with the goal of really making people compete with rankings would be ok too. But neither? Why?

Either the gameplay or the loot needs to be rewarding, and neither is all that special.

*Loot.*

Good god, I want to cry for the loot. The loot pool was made shallow to the extent of maybe 100 legendary guns when Destiny 1 could have literally 182,000 variants of the same gun. This would probably be excusable if it felt like each gun was a work of art, but it feels like a handful of drops from Destiny 1 were taken at random and chosen to be the ""fixed"" Destiny 2 roll. 

As an example, why on Earth did The Old Fasioned get Kill Clip... when Drop Mag is one of the perk choices? In order to activate Kill Clip nicely I have to reload, which then drops ammo if my timing doesn't happen to be good? It's the opposite of synergy. Why are the two perk choices on Call to Serve ""Extended Mag"" and ""Appended Mag""? Redundant perks? Seriously? Why is Nameless Midnight seen as top tier by sole virtue of having explosive rounds, and more importantly, why is loot so wimpy that seeing Nameless Midnight that way isn't wrong??

Basically, we got a lot of mediocre rolls as our fixed versions of guns with no chance at anything better. The loot in Destiny 2 feels watered down so much that I'm starting to think it might just be water. 

This is also a massive hit to replay value - yesterday I did my milestones for the week, dismantled the repeat gear I got from that, turned in the tokens I got from doing them, dismantled the repeat gear I got *from that*, then turned in the gunsmith parts I got from all that and *dismantled the repeats I got from that.* At the end of the day, I had managed to start back at square 1 - my factions didn't rank up (since that's not a thing anymore), and my gear wasn't better (since after about 200 hours I've gotten everything at least once). 

**Amassing loot and dismantling it felt like I was just making a mess in my inventory for the satisfaction of cleaning it up. I have not once in my years of experience with Destiny had such a strong feeling that I had wasted my time.**

By comparison, while Destiny 1's loot wasn't all amazing, I would say the average D1 roll was comparable to most of the D2 fixed rolls, so we have only a perceived loss of strength (the new kinetic/energy/power weapon system doesn't help). 

The worst part of it though is that there is absolutely 0 *hope* for better gear. There's no reason to check your second Nameless Midnight for outlaw, no chance of your Blue Shift having cluster bombs, not the remotest possibility that your Dire Promise will get the range perk it so desperately needs. *Hope* is gone from the loot-earning process, and when hope walks out the door, excitement follows out right behind it. 

Giving up those good feelings for the sake of balance in a game where loot is such an important motivator is a choice I can not understand... it's not like crucible is ranked, so what does balance even achieve anyway? Genuine question.

*Exotics.*

Exotics are underwhelming and could use almost across-the-board buffs. When you consider exotics from the perspective of balance, guns like The Last Word and Icebreaker stand out as unbalanced. Meanwhile, MIDA is a pretty balanced gun, but it's not very exciting. This explains why we still have MIDA, but do not have The Last Word or Icebreaker.

So to illustrate the point I'm making, consider The Last Word: a handcannon you pulled out with a quick twirl around your trigger finger and fired at unmatched speed by fanning the hammer with near perfect hip fire accuracy. How do you think it would go if someone suggested bringing a gun like The Last Word into Destiny 2? What do you think they would do to make it ""balanced""? Do you think it would compete with Last Hope, or Uriel's Gift?

And what about Icebreaker? A sniper with infinite, regenerating ammo that caused combustion upon enemy kills. Good luck finding a way to ""balance"" that.

Point being: balance inherently requires shooting down certain strong weapon ideas. I do not think that is worth it at all.

**Solutions?**

Option A: Stop making balance the central focus of the game. **Nobody is going to look back in 8 years and say ""Destiny 2 was so balanced, it was amazing,"" but people very well might think back on the rocket launcher that exploded into a wolf-pack of tiny homing rockets and obliterated nearly everything in the game.**

Reintroduce randomized rolls but control for it better. Create a list of perks and their values from weak, ok, strong, and incredible. Give them appropriate rarities (25%,50%,20%,5% as an example) and then find an appropriate pace to reduce luck levels as playtime increases so you have some level of diminishing returns. Reward players in a way that respects their dedication, but doesn't put them on a totally different level.

Reintroduce reforging alongside random perks such that you combine two weapons into one, choosing which perks from both you want and scrapping the rest, so god rolls are possible to **work towards.** Critically here, godrolls would become unique to the individual and feel like a progressive endeavor rather than a slot machine. Someone could log on and work on making their perfect Mannanan SR4. This system would make repeat drops of many kinds valuable, and players would finally have some customization that isn't purely cosmetic.

Make the mod system more robust. Attribute / Perk / Power mods. Weapons drop with 3 blank mod slots so it could be perk/perk/perk or power/power/attribute etc., and then make certain perks and attributes drop from certain activities. Attribute = stat modifiers (range/stability/reload or elemental type), perks = perks as they exist, power = adding power level from 1-8 or so. 

This would make it possible to get guns at a 24 inflated power level with 3 good power level mods, but with no perk or attribute improvements. You could also have a gun with greatly increased magazine size, but no perks or increased power level. Yes, this could create imbalance problems, but it would make mods and guns more fun.

Guns could be godrolls for 3 perk mod slots, or 3 power mod slots, or 3 attribute mod slots. Pretty much every setup would be desirable, because mods would be *good*.

Basically, option A = creatively address problems instead of forcing balance by eliminating problematic systems. If you're going to create a problem, blandness (balance) is a much worse one than unfairness (imbalance).

Option B: Make balance meaningful. Create ranked crucible playlists and scoring systems for pve. Do more interactive world events like faction rally (but encouraging more interactivity, such as doubling rewards when teamed with people of the same faction) so the equality of the playerbase's strength works to create a feeling of importance within the context of a larger goal. 

Honestly, this option entails no more raids - raids with ""balanced"" loot that are only accessible to players who spend more time than you're ""supposed to"" on the game are simply not worth making. The time spent in development of the world and its mechanics would be better spent on anything that the 80% of players would touch. 

I wish this was sarcastic or something, but imagine if at the end of the main story there was an optional mission that just required 3 people, and it was the raid with hugely watered down mechanics and enemy numbers so everyone who buys D2 could experience it. It would be, for the 80%, awesome.

Guided games could also achieve this if they'd really put the carrot on the stick for clans to guide, but presently the fear of making good loot makes this seem like the last thing they'd do... which is a shame, because it's the only thing I feel certain would work.

**Kinda related stuff I'm saying because we're approaching the end and that's what you do**

I have no doubt I could do a post of similar length to this about mods and subclasses.

Going to also throw it out there that Nightfall Strike design is actually top notch outside of the rewards one more time. I did a long post that got buried about that a while back, but they are genuinely great content that is, for all I can tell, underappreciated due to the lacking rewards. The various modifiers are interesting and create lots of cool gameplay variety, which builds on the already-strong strike design. They're great.

Also, Destiny 2's world design is amazing. The graphics are great, the lighting is beautiful, and the worlds are creative and interesting and atmospheric. It's a shame there are no collectibles to encourage you to explore the full depth of it and that lost sectors are basically a non factor in the gameplay, because the team that made all of that stuff *also* knocked it out of the park. It's fantastic and very easy to take for granted when the core gameplay usually don't force you to focus on it or engage with it very much. Still, it's amazing.

This is a long post of criticism, so I thought I should at least sprinkle in a couple of things that I actually think they did *perfectly*. Both world design and nightfalls are dramatic, unambiguous improvements to destiny 1's versions with no concessions made.

**So this is the actual point I'm making, aka, TL;DR:**

Destiny 2 seems to have a horrible identity crisis that has tarnished the RPG/MMOlike elements and, honestly, ruined them. I like the game and I'm glad I played it, but those aspects of my enjoyment in Destiny 1 were not once reignited during Destiny 2. Power level was a huge tease that set expectations in a place to deliver disappointment.

Replayability being crippled into nothingness has utterly destroyed the social aspect of the game for me. My friends do not play and do not want to play anymore. It is very sad to see. 

There is no doubt that the game has plenty of *playability*, and it's fun to play, but it cannot be treated as a hobby in its current state. I can't blame my friends for not playing, because the game feels intended to be beaten and moved on from. Bear in mind, I am one of those guys that play too much and so are my friends. This game does not work for that attitude at all, unfortunately for us.

Balance has taken a lot of the fun out of loot and the crucible without adding anything meaningful. Those who like it more this way are almost certainly rivaled by numbers who don't, because there's no question that the change is a matter of taste purely - but having less cool pve weapons is doubtlessly less fun. Therefore, balance has hurt the game more than it helps in my opinion. 

I wish they'd make a titan skating exotic.

People in a similar position to mine - on any level, and I am not the only person who has gotten more than 100 hours in these 5 weeks - want reason to keep playing the game, but will find none.

It leaves a lot to be desired.

Destiny 2 is a fun game to play. Its worlds are beautiful, your powers are fun, guns are incredibly satisfying to use, the lore is fun to read, enemies are unique, and every activity is very engaging to play... once. No doubt, it was a good purchase for me and I will no doubt keep playing as it goes on (and if Destiny 1 is an example, it *will* get better as patches and dlcs drop).

But still, I wish the developers would make a committed decision to design the game with one play through or replay-ability in mind, and with fun or competition in mind, because the indecision drags both approaches deep into the mud. Who knows what the key here is, but Destiny 2, without a doubt, feels like a game that took no risks.

Edit: Also, as much as the community here has its share of bad eggs, Destiny is by and far a very welcoming and kind community of players. It's definitely not something anyone - Bungie or us - should take for granted.

I am only 1 person, but if enough of us voice our opinion on this matter,maybe we can get them to budge eventually.....

EDIT: Front Page! Hi Bungie!!! Also, I was in Seattle this past week and made a visit to your HQ wearing some very fashionable swag! http://imgur.com/O5wDv7x

EDIT #2: There is ALOT of confusion around what Cross Save is. It is NOT Cross Play, which I get, Sony is blocking that on any game (see Rocket League or Minecraft). Cross Save just lets you use one character account for all three systems but you only play against those on the same system you are currently logged in on. Also, there are plenty of examples of games that have restricted content on certain systems yet makes cross save work. 

EDIT #3: Last edit (unless u/deej_bng maybe responds????) but one thing I initially meant to post was this game was built on a community driven experience, and with all the comments below that say (""find new friends"" or ""Most of my Clan mates are jumping ship"") this goes directly against what this game is built around. This seems to be a simple way to maintain the friendships that have been build for so long but gives us an opportunity to make new ones while not losing those old ones. 

EDIT #4: For those that are continually checking the thread to see if there was a response by our good friends at Bungie, sadly, none yet. If there is one, I will update accordingly, but I wanted to Thank everyone for making your voices heard. At the time of this edit, 146.4K people have viewed this thread and an amazing 9,037 guardians feel like I do and took the time to up vote (90% up vote which is pretty incredible) and 1300 chose to personally express their opinions in the comments below. I cannot wait to dive in to D2 and maybe, just maybe, we will get to experience this wonderful game on any console we choose someday soon. Until then, see you on the battlefield! (I chose friends over FPS btw....maybe)",2017-08-29 11:32:17

---

Hey everyone, 


Like we did a few weeks ago on the Livestream, we’re going to continue to talk about how *Destiny* will continue to evolve this Fall and beyond. This update is about how we’re changing Eververse. 


We’ve already made a number of changes to Eververse in Season of Opulence (we’ve redesigned the store, we’ve made Bright Engrams only include Year 1 gear—and have it bias heavily toward giving you items you haven’t unlocked in your Collections), and we’re going to make more changes to the economy, store, and armor in this fall’s patch. 

###Armor 

It stinks to go to the Eververse store and see an item that looks cool and then seeing that the item has bad perks on it. In fact, when we’re setting up the armor, we’d twist ourselves up in knots to make sure the Eververse armor sets didn’t have good perks. We did this because we want the best way to get sweet perks on your armor to be by playing the game, not shopping for enhanced Hand Cannon loaders at Tess. The root cause (dating all the way back to *Destiny* 1) is that Eververse armor has always had perks/gameplay capability as a part of the package. 


We’re done with that. As of this September, all Eververse armor is being converted into Universal Ornaments. These Universal Ornaments can be applied to all of the Legendary armor sets we’re releasing this Fall. They override the look of your equipped gear while preserving the perks, mods, and stats of the original item. 


Any Eververse Armor you have acquired in your Collections will have its Universal Ornaments automatically unlocked for use on new Legendary armor. For example, if the song in your heart is to have your Titan roll with the 2018 Tin Man-esque Festival of the Lost Helmet, you can put it on any of the new Legendary armor coming to the game this fall.

Work in progress build.

###Evolving Bright Dust



Historically, the best way to earn Bright Dust in *Destiny* 2 has been to buy a bunch of Bright Engrams, shard everything from the engrams, build a giant bankroll of Bright Dust and then spend it when the Warlock Dire Ahamkara helmet shows up the Bright Dust row in the last week of the season. We’re going to change this. 


This Fall we’re changing Bright Dust from a pay- and/or play-to-earn currency to a play-to-earn reward. We’re adding Bright Dust as a reward for completing Vanguard, Crucible, and Gambit bounties. We want all players to earn Dust for playing, not for spending money and destroying a bunch of items in their inventory. After you complete all your bounties for the week, there will be an additional avenue to keep grinding out Bright Dust. 


It’s also been pretty uncool to go to the Collection screen and spend Bright Dust to get shaders or Ghost Shells or whatever. We’re going to fix that too. Beginning September 17, Eververse items in your Collections will cost Glimmer and Legendary Shards. If you want to keep pulling out that Exotic Sparrow that looks like a motorcycle until you get the good Sparrow perk (Instant Summon), you can do that with Legendary Shards and Glimmer. 

###Changes to Dismantling Eververse Items

Lastly, because we are changing the cost of pulling things out of the Collections, Eververse items will no longer dismantle into Bright Dust. This Fall, Eververse items will dismantle into Legendary Shards and Glimmer.  


However, that means right now the absolute best thing you can do with all the Eververse items you don’t use regularly—armor, Sparrows, shaders, Ghost Shells, transmat effects—is dismantle them. Sitting on a pile of Midnight Talons or Metro Shift from your Year 1 stockpiles? Shard ’em for Dust. 


That’s right! Everything must go—dismantle the extra stuff you have in your inventory, build up a huge amount of Bright Dust, and spend it on sweet stuff as it rolls through the Eververse store—because on September 17, everything changes. 


TL;DR recap for Twitter:


**On September 17, 2019: **



* All Eververse armor (new and armor you’ve already acquired!) is being converted into Universal Ornaments
* Universal Ornaments can be attached to any newly acquired Legendary armor
* Bright Dust is going to come from doing bounties, not dismantling things you spent money on
* Eververse items can now be pulled from your Collections with Glimmer/Legendary Shards instead of Bright Dust


**Before September 17, 2019:**



* Dismantle all of your unused Eververse items to maximize your Bright Dust reserves 


Thanks and see you soon,

You can't spam fusion grenades every 25 seconds. You can't ignore your positioning and skate out of trouble when things get hairy. I'm sure that's going to be frustrating for people who relied on this stuff in D1.

You could do things that aren't tactically sound in an FPS game and get away with it in D1, and in D2 you are switfly and appropriately punished for bad habits. The things people are complaining that they can't do now worked in D1 sometimes because of an abundance of weapons/abilities that could either kill in one hit, or make someone weak enough that a single primary shot would clean them up.

What inches me even closer to an aneurysm is that you also couldn't get away with this stuff in D1 if you were up against good players. The difference in D2 is that you get punished, even at a more casual level, for bad PvP habits. Teamshooting was king in D1, too, but there was no need to utilize it unless you were up against good players. Good teams would punish flankers and lock down lanes with sound positioning and map control.

I get the frustration with solo queue- it is noticeably more difficult to win and perform well solo. It's always going to be hard to win with telepathy versus people communicating with one another over voice chat. This was also true in D1, and we complained about it enough to get freelance playlists. Those playlists had a laughably short life span because not enough people actually utilized them.

I see a lot of people asking for the Overwatch system (where full teams are only matched up with other full teams, 2-3 stacks are matched with other 2-3 stacks, etc), but you then also have to consider that this means longer queue times with worse connection quality.

This is also, I suspect, symptomatic of more connection-based matchmaking. Many of us might have considered ourselves above average in D1, only to realize the skill gap ahead of us now that we're facing a broader range of opposition to start off D2. I'm sure that will sort itself out over time as MMRs start to tighten the available pool of opponents for skilled players, but in the meantime let's not kid ourselves and blame the game for our own bad habits.",2017-09-14 05:34:41

[This week at Bungie -Last Paragraph](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/46381)
>On a personal note; just the other night, after we caught up in the Crucible, I had dinner with a dude I met as my teammate in a Bungie game eleven years ago. I am a product of the Bungie community. My challenge to every Guardian is to look to the human element in Destiny 2 to fuel your appetite for ultimate re-playability. The ultimate loot is the friendships that can grow out of a game like this. There will be more gear to add to your character (next week, even). The rewards that I’m talking about are the people in the community that thrives in this game. If you let them, they’ll make your hobby as a light-dealing hero on a starside campaign for glory even better.

>Thanks to those of you who are helping us to drive that scene.


And his response to the angry internet mob that followed:
>Reddit, that was a personal note from me about a nice moment I had with a long-lived friend of mine, not an official statement about Bungie's attitude about the endgame. I've always been a community guy. That's why I play games. Anyone who knows me knows I'm not an elite Raider or a 1%er in the Crucible. Games are another social outlet for me - a collaborative, tactical roleplay for an old improvisational actor who has always loved action movies. Destiny is a social game, and we have a lot of new players in our community who have never joined a Clan or opened their experience to another human voice. My personal story was as a positive example to inspire them to take a chance on us. If you seek more reasons to play, I'll see you in Iron Banner next week. If Crucible isn't your thing, good luck in the Prestige Raid. I'll sit that out. When the designers tell me they don't expect everyone to complete that, I know what they mean. Peace.


Please Note:

* Deej is a community manager, NOT a developer
* This is HIS opinion
* He clearly reminds us that there IS MORE CONTENT COMING
* It was actually a nice story

Does this mean that he thinks the game is perfect as it is? Or that BUNGIE devs aren't actively addressing the issues we've been raising? No. 

I wholeheartedly agree that the game has flaws, I expect that to change over time as we've seen in the past, but these things DO take time.

And now the sense of entitlement that allows us to get so angry needs to go. Many of us are already at a sub-$1 per hour value of the game and more content is coming.

But if you do care about the game, and you do want to create a dialogue around the current issues related to it, we must be civil. Continue to ask questions before coming to conclusions, and lets get this conversation between Bungie and the community going. If we don't act with civility, they will continue to be afraid to speak to us. If they are not yet ready to start this conversation we must continue to demonstrate our willingness to try.


Looking back at D1, what sticks out more to me WAS the interactions with friends, and how it connected me with them despite having moved far away. I remember late night raids, pushing AFK people off of ledges and laughing when they returned, nailing friends to the wall with a sparrow boost, and discussing at length various points of lore and spinfoil theories. 

I don't entirely disagree with Deej, I see where he's coming from because as with life the experiences are what matters most, but I also look forward to the gameplay changes that will support my drive to return to D2 on a regular basis. 

&nbsp;



*Edit: Thanks to everyone for the metric ton of Gold but also for the community support. This overwhelmingly positive response is truly evidence that we have been a quiet majority, and by the numbers it looks like only a small portion of people disagree.*

*I truly believe that this is solid proof that Bungie can safely be increasingly transparent with us, and I certainly hope they do. We are clearly a community which wants to support you Bungie!*

*Stay classy Guardians :)*

I visited Bungie with the explicit purpose of giving the devs high fives. Here’s what I learned!,9695,7ol9g6,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/7ol9g6/i_visited_bungie_with_the_explicit_purpose_of/,2144,1515295231.0,"Hi all, below is a fairly long read from a Destiny 2 optimist.

I’d like to preface this by saying that I understand the game’s flaws. At launch, it lacked -- and still lacks -- a significant amount of end-game content. Too many goods that ought to be farmable, such as sparrows, are kept behind Eververse. The story mode is not a cinematic masterpiece, and the experience rate controversy brought the game down. The omission of chat options on the PC version is a sorely missed opportunity for community growth. There are, of course, more problems than these. Destiny 2 isn’t a perfect game, but in my opinion it doesn’t deserve as much flack as it gets from /r/games and /r/destinythegame. I’m fine not doing the raids for now, Eververse feels like another grind, the story was pretty rad IMO, and I didn’t pay much attention to the EXP problem. The point of this post isn’t to talk about this feature or that, it’s about *how* we talk about them.

“Harsh love” is a term often attributed to the criticism that players give to the games that they play, but I feel like criticism for Destiny 2 is just “harsh”. Obviously, this is not to say that we should stop criticizing the game entirely; that’s not how we see the games that we love improved. Instead, I feel it’s important to remember that the people developing these games are folks just like you and me, guys and gals who make honest mistakes and aren’t ashamed to admit to them. These people’s commitment to reflection is what resonated with me the most after I, out of the blue, walked up to Bungie’s HQ with this [dinky little paper](https://imgur.com/Knod4AC) to cheer up the devs for the day.

I was visiting a friend near Bellevue, WA, and she was busy working for the day. Bothered by the internet backlash, I felt like expressing my appreciation for Destiny 2 in person with the free time that I had yesterday. I took a bus, saw the sights, ate at the godlike local food trucks, and swung by their HQ, paper in hand.

But in order to take my post in front of Bungie’s double doors, I had to pass the idea with Jerome Simpson, a man who has supposedly stopped all manner of uninvited guests from sneaking in. Afraid that my day would end before it began, I approached him at his desk. When I told him what I intended on doing -- standing outside of Bungie’s entrance for the day giving *free* high fives – he gave me a look of clear suspicion and asked:

“Why would you want to do that?”

“Why not?” I shakily replied.

It worked! The saint that he is, he let me stay outside as long as I wanted.

I worrisomely opened my paper to the first crowd of oncoming devs as they came back from lunch: one, two, no, *six* high fives were delivered in one moment, smiles and grins abound. My heart soared; my idea worked!

And [work it did for the next 5 hours](https://imgur.com/RaCDWEw). I got to talk about the game I loved with the people who made it, and got to meet a bunch of folks responsible for individual snippets of the game. Ones who worked on PvP map art, design, and balancing, others who worked on the game’s visual effects, and Destiny 2’s lead environmental artist. He helped design the EDZ, which he revealed had been in development for quite a few years and was too process-intensive to be released for earlier console generations. 

It was with him that I felt most badly for Bungie. As we spoke, he led me further inside Bungie’s HQ and into a room where we could talk more about the game. We discussed almost every aspect about it, and more specifically how each could be improved. What shone through as we spoke wasn’t his technical expertise or his studio know-how, but his connection to the game as a product of his work and to the company as his family. We eventually got to the topic of why I was there; Destiny 2’s community backlash. Rob sounded deflated, but adamantly determined by it. The team’s morale, he stated, was (and is) fairly low thanks to the aforementioned subreddit’s negative responses, and to the effective uselessness of the Bungie forums, plagued by the onslaught of #RemoveEververse posts. Bungie’s hit morale in turn hit his own. Rob loves this game, and he wants it to improve just like the rest of us, and just like the rest of Bungie. Seeing his discouragement hurt.

Word of the mysterious guy with the dinky sign spread around. On multiple occasions, devs would search me out, receive their free high five, and duck back in to the blue depths of the massive building, including Jerome the security guy. Some brought me to take a picture with the [resident Captain](https://imgur.com/VHzI8zC). Other times, they would stay awhile and tell me about their work, and their favorite parts about being at Bungie. By and large, the answers to that last question related to the feeling of teamwork that made the great 700+ employee size of the company feel constructive, and a bit like family, too.

And for a while, Bungie let me in to that family. Passers-by brought me Destiny paraphernalia and stories of their work. A gang of the artists within brought me a [signed piece](https://imgur.com/iokZ5Y0) and hung out with me. Another went back into the office, before leaving for the weekend, to bring me a sizeable Destiny 2 poster. I was asked often for game feedback, more as a conversation than as an interview or a business transaction. The devs really appreciated the gesture of a fan coming over and saying hi. No complaints about Eververse, no hyperbolic statements on this feature or that, but contentment.

The day ended with a visit from none other than [M.E. Chung](https://imgur.com/eZHpbrl), often sourced as the reason for the game’s lack of general PC chat options. I asked her about it as she had clearly expected, and she gave me some clarification that neatly summarized my discoveries that day:

General chat was not in the scope of the original launch.

You may say that this was a must-have feature for the original launch. Perhaps you’ll believe that it’s omission was a consequence of miscommunication. As I learned, what the absence of this feature was *not*, was a purposeful pandering to a safer audience, a sentiment that the Destiny 2 community relays. This was something that M.E. Chung had supposedly clarified to the community multiple times, but to no avail. She says that, had the choice of general chat been an option, she would have included it. 

She attributes her thick skin to this miscommunication as not hardened contempt against the community, but understanding. As an avid Ultima Online forum-goer, she’d make the same kinds of posts and give the same kinds of sentiments that we now see directed at Destiny 2. What I felt I understood with that final encounter was that M.E. Chung, like Bungie as a whole, is one of us. They’re prone to make mistakes, and they’re even prone to making those same mistakes a second time. What these mistakes should *not* be attributed to is a sense of maliciousness, as if though these people are out to get us with the game’s problems and shortcomings. 

In the case that this *were* the situation, criticism of our kind would certainly be more warranted. But as I learned with my visit to Bungie, it’s not all it’s cracked up to be. Some of the game’s features reached completion, while others… just… didn’t. Feedback for Destiny 2 will always be valuable, it will never be the perfect game, but the kind that our community is giving, filled with mistrust and fueled by anger, isn’t breathing life into Bungie, it’s taking it away. It’s killing the improvement for the very game we all want to see made better.

Before posting your next angry letter, take a breath. Exercise. Do some chores. Reflect, and come back to the keyboard when you’re ready to give feedback rather than flames. Try giving a high-five instead of a smack.

Thanks for reading.

"If it takes Bungie 3 yrs to polish this game to D1 standards, I'm going to have a hard time buying D3.",9681,75wyik,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/75wyik/if_it_takes_bungie_3_yrs_to_polish_this_game_to/,1984,1507843498.0,"I know, another salt post, but I'll try and keep it short.  Vanilla D1 was far from perfect, but slowly, Bungie's Live Team listened to our complaints/requests, and implemented improvements over the years. And the final product was pretty amazing.  I remember back earlier this year, at the big D2 reveal, Mr. Smith pushed his sales pitch about D ""2"".  Like, a different game.  A fresh start.  All the, ""4 man fireteam crucible,"" and ""guided games so everyone can have an opportunity to participate in PVE endgame"" sales pitch.   

With good intentions, sometimes comes consequences.  And that's what I'm experiencing over anything else in D2.  4 player crucible is slow, and when it's a team shot sport with high ttk, and slow movement speed, and slow charging supers, it's like rubbing salt in the wound. (no pun intended)  The PVE could have been amazing, but it's just, as many have described it, shallow. Secrets?  God roll drops?  Nope.  It's a 1 and done experience for the most part.    

D1 had a good progression, and by TTK, Bungie stepped up their game, and then followed through with RoI, which I thought was amazing.   Personally, hidden secrets, really tough raids, and mind blowing puzzles are what keeps me coming back, and there's none of that here for me. 

So, to sum it up, I think D2's ""fresh start"" regarding ""rethinking"" the game was a mistake.  I think Bungie should have picked up where they left off, and made improvements.  It's what I believe people expected.  That's where there was so much potential.  A 10 year game that felt like a 10 year game.  What we have is a 3 year game, and a different Destiny experience all together with D2.  Feels so disconnected to me.    

Anyway, I believe in a couple years, they'll be quality of life improvements, maybe random roll loot, and all the good stuff we miss from D1.  And by then, maybe D2 will be what I thought I was buying at purchase.  But by then, it may be too late.  Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice?    ",2017-10-13 05:24:58

I have played a day of Public Events with the Electronica Shell equipped and one without it. It does not provide additional loot. It's time to give us transparent numbers on all 'boosts' so the community can track them.,9568,7jz3e4,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/7jz3e4/i_have_played_a_day_of_public_events_with_the/,729,1513365453.0,"Starting with the XP throttling mess, I have to say a lot of the 'boosts' are shady and not transparent. Another day, a user claimed the ""All XP gains increased by 10%"" from the Cosmos Shell, for example, does not for some reason stack with the Fireteam Medallion. 



I was lucky to acquire the Exotic [Electronica Shell](http://db.planetdestiny.com/items/view/1558857466) which is supposed to provide ""increased loot from public events on all destinations"". 

~~This is not working. All Public Events still give me a chance of a blue item and a token.~~ *See Edit 5*

---

It's time for Bungie to give us numbers on these stats so we can track them properly. Is this another bugged thing? Remember, those are Eververse items, which means you can pay for them and in no way see the benefit advertised. I enjoy the game and try to keep salt to a minimum, but all these shady 'boosts' and hidden mechanics of what stacks and what doesn't to hinder progression in a way Bungie wants it is just complete and utter bullshit.


---

Edit: I want to be clear, it's the description of the items that I find bogus and unclear. ""Increased loot"" to me does not mean a ""chance for increased loot"" or a ""chance for BETTER loot"", those are three different things. Secondly, why are the mechanics behind all of these items so shady? Why does the cosmos shell not stack? I agree this ""sample"" is not a really significant sample size or a statistically relevant outcome. It's about the fact that there are bogus descriptions in items you are being sold that do not work together with other items and also are phrased in a way that give you the feeling of some great perk when in fact you are all probably right and it raises the chance of an exotic from 0.015% to 0.016% which obviously one person can not possibly validate. It is a matter of transparency and fairness, that items behind a loot box sale system are clearly described.

---

Edit2: Look, I understand that clearly I should not expect an exotic from every public event, I just want you to think about this for a second: There is no way Eververse is not designed in order for you to go in there and think ""wow, look at this cool shit, cool, this one even gives *increased loot* from public events. Ok, I will get some Silver, I want that"" - perks like this being in a mtx loot box system is already borderline disgusting, but then they aren't even noticable? So there is two solutions: It's either tiny because the community would be outraged that there are items sold that give a tangible benefit to the experience or it's bugged. I think it's the former, but that makes the placement and the item descriptions in the Eververse just intentionally shady. That's my point.

---

Edit3: [I have done the winding cove event now four times for exp comparisons](https://i.imgur.com/6Byh9VN.png?1). Each time, I only rallied to the flag and shot the ship (for heroic). Here are the results: 

- [No boost: 2000 XP](https://i.imgur.com/BjCXnaX.png)
- [Cosmos Shell: 2200 XP](https://i.imgur.com/kdYwmwg.png)
- Fireteam Medallion: 2500 XP
- Cosmos Shell + Fireteam Medallion: 2500 XP 

Forgot to take a screenshot for the last two, if people think I'm bullshitting I will oblige.

Edit4: [Bungie replied](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/7jz3e4/i_have_played_a_day_of_public_events_with_the/drauu26/)

---

~~This is not working. All Public Events still give me a chance of a blue item and a token.~~

*Edit5: In light of Bungie's response, I find it fair to strike through that comment since it's only really valid on Mercury. The larger point still stands, though, buff stacks are not working in the case of XP and remain elusive with regards to loot drops, phrasing of the items still leaves room for interpretation. This is still not a great way to market things for loot box purchases.*

Destiny writers: stop telling us how powerful Rasputin is and SHOW us.,9543,cfenij,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/cfenij/destiny_writers_stop_telling_us_how_powerful/,750,1563606492.0,"Pretty much what it says on the tin. Rasputin's been a part of our Guardian's story since waking up in the Cosmodrome. We're always hearing in flavortext and lore pages about what he was/is capable of and what a massive threat he could be. Rasputin's IKELOS weapons are top-tier and Sleeper is apparently powerful enough to need its main exotic perk nerfed^(and its charge time, and aim assist, and damage falloff, and reserve size, and...) The Aurora Reach facility is stunningly large and I don't know anyone who wasn't awed by his sheer presence in the ending cutscene of Warmind.

And yet, **every time we interact with him in-game, it's us having to bail him out of trouble**. I know that's what Guardians do, but we've gone well past ""doing the Warmind a favor"" territory by now. Outside of giving us the Valkyrie and bombarding that shard in the EDZ, Rasputin barely participates in the actual plot of Warmind. The most we've heard about him is that one week when Petra mentioned they were sending Dreaming City data to him for analysis; oh, and that grim page in Calus' future-fanfic where he, surprise surprise, loses again. He didn't even merit a threat assessment page in the Stolen Intelligence book! When does the Warmind get to fight at all, let alone win one for once!?

If you're going to have us keep believing Rasputin really is the most powerful weapon in the solar system, he's going to have to do *something* sooner or later. He's going to have to win a battle if we're ever going to take him seriously. And I want to see that! I would *love* to see Rasputin absolutely drop the hammer on some fools. I would love to see what warsats are for besides crashing. What's the point of befriending a Warmind if we can't call in the occasional orbital strike? There's a Hive castle sitting out in the open on the Moon - why can't we ask Rasputin to just vaporize the damn thing? Hell, even if he's moving against us, I'd still like to see Rasputin finally demonstrate some of the power everyone ascribes to him.

**tl;dr Destiny writers please ""tell"" less and ""show"" a lot more when it comes to Rasputin.**

&#x200B;

**Obligatory edit:** Whoa, people gave me shiny things? For talking about Destiny lore? It's all my dreams come true!

**Edit 2:** Wow, okay. I sure wasn't expecting this many people to care about this, and I feel a lot better knowing they do. I'm new to reddit and I don't even know what half these numbers mean but there sure are a lot of them. Seems pretty clear Destiny's got a ""telling not showing"" problem in general, but it costs a lot more to show in-game than to tell in-lore and I appreciate that. Part of my issue with the way Rasputin is portrayed is that he doesn't get to do that much in lore, either. We see a lot about how and why he was built, some prep for the Darkness' arrival - then very little of the actual war, and very little of his actions afterwards. The only time we see him fight is that time he annihilates a Vex-Cabal skirmish on Mars (which was awesome). I want to read less about other people saying he's scary powerful and more about him doing scary powerful things. 

And I want to read a lot more about him as a character. He was never meant to be a person, but he is. He has likes and dislikes, he has emotions (even if he won't admit it), he has grief and trauma from the Collapse he still refuses to process. One of my favorite Grimoire cards is Ghost Fragments: Mysteries, one of the only ones told from the perspective of Rasputin-the-person instead of Rasputin-the-commander. If he's back, let him be back. Let us talk to him! Let us know what's going on with him!

And please let him make us some new toys. I've got four words for you, Bungie: Exotic. Heavy. IKELOS. Crossbow.",2019-07-20 15:08:12

Hey everyone,


As we get closer and closer to serving up Shadowkeep and New Light, it has become increasingly clear to us that our releases for this Fall would benefit from a bit more time in the oven.


Being independent means that the future of Destiny 2 is entirely on our team. It also means that we’re agile enough to choose to do what's best for the game and our players, even if it's the hard choice.


We wanted to let you—our Community—know first that we're changing the date for Shadowkeep and New Light from September 17 to October 1.


This Fall is the first step on a journey for what our team wants Destiny 2 to become - a place for you and your friends to play anytime, anywhere; owning the action MMO and RPG elements that we love about the game; and crushing barriers to entry for friends. We just need a bit of extra time to take the first step.


We didn't make this decision lightly. We know for some of you (us too), Destiny releases are events where you take time off of work or develop a sudden sickness that keeps you from school or work (we get it, a bunch of our team takes some time off to go on their own Destiny Jacket Quest). We're sorry for screwing up your plans and we wanted to share this information as quickly as we could.


Here's some more date housecleaning:



* The World First for the new Raid Garden of Salvation will begin on Saturday, October 5. It’s a weekend Raid race and Contest will be active
* We’re extending Moments of Triumph through September 17 – you’ll have three more weeks to complete this year’s challenges and unlock all of the in-game and [Bungie rewards](https://bungiestore.com/collections/bungie-rewards)
* We’re going to run an additional Iron Banner the week of September 17 as well
* Cross Save will come online later this Summer, so you’ll have time to sort out your Friend Lists well ahead of Shadowkeep

Insta Summon is the only perk on a sparrow that I care about,9474,cuyib7,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/cuyib7/insta_summon_is_the_only_perk_on_a_sparrow_that_i/,431,1566706671.0,"I don't even know the name of any other perk. 

My suggestion would be

1) give every sparrow insta summon as a base stat as a QOL improvement

2) make sparrow perks more unique and actually worth it, for example:

- vertical boost: gives you the ability to jump in vertical direction (10 sec cd)
- stealth: makes your sparrow invisible for 5 sec (20 sec cd)
- true knight: you can use your melee while on a sparrow
- collector: you don't have to hop off your sparrow to collect materials
- best friends: two people can sit on a sparrow

Just some ideas I had while watching TV.

Edit: u/StickDonkey made a suggestion in the comments for another perk: ejection seat. I guess the name pretty much speaks for itself. You press a button and get launched up in the air. That would be pretty useful if you accidently drive off a cliff.",2019-08-25 12:17:51

Needless to say, it was inspired by the Destiny 1's Pursuits/Quest Tab.

---
---

EDIT I: Editing this so I can point up some of the things that people might not notice at first glance.

* Under the Quests ""IN YOUR SIGHTS"" and ""HUSH, LITTLE BABY"", you can see three little bars, one of which is lit up. They represent the number of objectives within that quest that you still have yet to complete. The objective showcased on screen would rotate every 5 seconds or so, and those bars you light up in correspondence to their objective.

  So, for example, if you had already completed the Headshot kills on your Revoker quest, only two bars would show up on the ""IN YOUR SIGHTS"" quest.

* The ""TEST OF STRENGTH"" quest has a green gradient behind it. Probably self-explanatory, but it's supposed to show the player that they are tracking that quest. I think the green gradient behind it really makes it distinguishable, but not enough to be jarring.

---

**EDIT II**

* Q: ""What happens if I complete all the quests?""
* A: If you've ran out of quests to do, Triumphs that are near completion could show up there. This could potentially give players the incentive to complete said Triumphs, since they would be right next to the Bounties, which players are constantly checking. Catalysts, Badges or even Seals could also show up there.

According to Jason Schreier of Kotaku there was a big reboot of the development of Destiny 2 sometime in early 2016.,9170,7nubxe,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/7nubxe/according_to_jason_schreier_of_kotaku_there_was_a/,2456,1515011279.0,"Jason Schreier recently said this on the DTR Podcast. Here is the link to what he said: https://youtu.be/A_Z0RgwFnAc?t=14m53s

Here is the exact quote for people that can't listen to the full podcast:

> I think that it (Destiny 2) was made in a relatively short period of time. There was a big reboot of Destiny 2 at some point of early 2016. There had been a previous director who was directing the game before Luke Smith (who's the current director) took over. So that guy was kind of put aside and Luke Smith took over. I believe that was in April of 2016 but I might be misremembering. Don't hold me to that exact line. So if you think about it that way then they didn't really have a ton of time. It had been a 16 months period between the reboot and when the game finally shipped.

He also talked about how Eververse came to existence in Destiny 1. He said: 

> What Bungie decided was we can't do this any more this is too hard for us to do (referring to releasing a DLC every few months) the tools that we're working with are really hard to deal with. it's hard for us to make this much content. it's just hard to make content in general. And they said we're going to do a smaller or drip feed of smaller stuff and we're going to put up the Eververse and make money that way, and **Activision said okay**. it was a part of their renegotiated deal and they got to a point where they didn't have to be cranking up so much content  

This is just unbelievable and it really goes to show that Bungie does not learn for their mistakes. 

**If rebooting the development of Destiny 1 didn't work out well fot you then why the hell did you guys think that it would be an amazing idea to reboot the development of Destiny 2??**",2018-01-04 04:27:59

Bungie Continuously Beats Its Playerbase To A Pulp,9135,7l4h0q,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/7l4h0q/bungie_continuously_beats_its_playerbase_to_a_pulp/,1187,1513833253.0,"I just wanted to say this, as clearly and concisely as possible; I apologize for the salt, but this has been on my mind for a while. From under-cooked, bloody, raw, DLC's to two stacks of the same shader, one of which gives dust and one of which doesn't simply because you purchased one and not the other, to completely inappropriate nerfs, to the consistent mishandling of pretty much every aspect of their game. Honestly, if the gunplay weren't there, what would there be to keep us coming back to this game?

I am so sick of trying to enjoy this game that I've loved since day one of D1 and being constantly slapped across the damn face by a developer who, frankly, seems incapable of giving a *single* solitary fuck about their playerbase; and I really mean that. I have *really* tried to focus on the gunplay, and stay positive, but with the Dawning and the likely onslaughts to come it's just too much now. They used to be subtle in their laziness, and TTK was an excellent step forward as were expansions from then on, but now it feels like the game's development process is being run by some stubborn 5 year old who can't stop holding their middle finger up to your face. It's a toxic and abusive relationship, plain and simple;  and it's disappointing as hell.

The Dawning was a great opportunity for them to take a shot at redemption, and it looked good to begin with. But two hours in and I see that leveling up gives you regular loot boxes, the boons don't even give you the seasonal gear, and the armor isn't even in the gift quests loot pool... I mean, what the hell? 'Tis the season to be fucking greedy apparently. I honestly don't know what to expect from Bungie going forward, but let me tell you, the bar is *real* fucking low. Literally any semblance of effort would be like a damn firework show at this point. Right now, every action they take seems to say ""fuck you and your enjoyment, give me your fucking money or else"", and if they claim otherwise, they sure as hell had me fooled. 

This could be *such* an incredible game under proper management. Honestly, if this game were properly developed, it would likely dominate the charts. It's just a shame that its fate is being determined by the actions of a developer who is still riding their own Halo glory days dick and continuously and consistently proves to be more and more unworthy of the title ""Game Developer"", and even more so of the name ""Bungie"". 

Remember when we all saw the Destiny 1 announcement at E3 and our thoughts were ""wow these are the guys who made Halo""? How much weight does that name hold now? A fraction of that I reckon. 

To be clear though, none of this applies to the visual and audio designers of the game. They are the ones who deserve the real praise. It's a shame they're being bottle necked by the people they labor beneath. Bungie needs to start investing its resources in the right places. And that **IS NOT** Eververse.

*sigh*

I think I'm gonna take a break from this game for a couple of months. I just needed to get some of this salt off my chest. I'll see you guys around.



EDIT: Nice to see the support guys. For Bungie to see, accurately, where it stands as of today in the eyes of the community is of fundamental importance to the state of the game. Keep the feedback and comments coming.

EDIT: Damn, reddit gold, I appreciate the enthusiasm guys, truly.

EDIT: Some comments mentioned that this post lacks constructive criticism. While it was only intended to express some thoughts, I've given a rudimentary improvements list a go below. 


LIST OF POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS:

- Heroic strike playlist re-instated for all players, no long locked behind a DLC after it was already available in game. 

- If Eververse *must* stay, i would argue that the ratio of aesthetically comparable gear in EV to in game rewards systems such as strikes should be in the range of 1:3 to 1:5. You cant have a looter shooter where literally more than 50% of the loot is behind the lootbox system.

- Less childish dialogue. Seriousness needs to be re-introduced into this game. You expect me to believe the characters are devastated by the capture of the city while they take every single opportunity to make a discount Cayde 6 joke? Come on. 

- I'm not a huge fan of the new weapons system. It feels like 70% of powerful weapons are stuck competing for one slot while the other 30% are split between two. I personally would not be opposed to reverting to the D1 weapon system or perhaps adding a 4th PVE only weapon (i saw this in a post on this sub but i could not locate it, so credit to whoever that was :D).

- For the love of god, get rid of the hidden juggler perk. It's *so* obvious that it's there. 

- The re-introduction of ammo syntheses would make us feel much more powerful in strikes and raids where now we feel like beached whales when we run out of ammo.

- Exotics should feel more powerful than legendaries and should hold true value in your inventory. Perhaps a set of pvp perks vs pve perks might be considered to avoid the complications of attempting to balance different pieces in both pve and pvp.

- Raid loot needs an overhaul to increase incentive across the board. Make the various raids worth completing *fully*. 

- Super cooldowns in general should be upped (not drastically). Just to increase the pace of combat in pve and pvp and make us feel more powerful. The success of the re-introduction of mayhem was, if anything, a sign that this is the correct direction to move in. 

- PVP needs to be slightly faster paced (see the above point). I believe this could be accomplished by getting rid of this whole team-shooting gangbang meta that devalues the skill of individual guardians and discourages heroic displays of pure skill. 

- Either the re-introduction of permanent swappable shaders, or the implementation of a system of crafting permanent shaders out of a certain number of the consumable shader equivalent.

- Furthermore, there should be permanent shaders aquired through *activity completions* for specific challenges. Raids, specific strikes, certain milestones, etc. 

- From now on, Bungie should be 100% transparent with numbers working behind the scenes such as XP gains, 3oC boost numbers, etc. 

- Perhaps make exotics slightly harder to get and thus more exciting to open in terms of engrams. I was pretty taken aback when I got to pick up my first exotic after playing only an hour or so. 

This was simply what I could come up with right now. Feel free to leave feedback below!

This is already more difficult with a full Masterwork requiring a lot more Masterwork Cores. It's nearly impossible at this point to both have Masterwork weapons and have high light weapons. Masterworks don't drop on weapons anymore. Spider has prices that make a waste of money to buy more than 10 or 15. This makes cores even more difficult to get than during Season 2/3. 


It's like if Strange Coins were used for infusing in D1. That wouldn't make any sense since it's a rare currency with 1 purpose that's completely unrelated to infusing. Masterwork Cores are the same way. They should be used to make Masterworks. Not to artificially inflate the length of the power grind/Masterwork grind.

"I am a player that wants Destiny as my hobby, and these are reasons that prevent me from returning frequently",9075,7goiza,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/7goiza/i_am_a_player_that_wants_destiny_as_my_hobby_and/,1193,1512096109.0,"I'd like to start by saying thanks to Bungie for speaking up. The very beginning of [their epic blog post](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/46504) stood out to me the most:

> Going forward, Destiny 2’s post-launch game systems, features, and updates are being designed specifically to focus on and support players who want Destiny to be their hobby – the game they return to, and a game where friendships are made. We want Destiny to be a game that fits into your life, providing you with reasons to log in and play with your friends, clans, and families. We want Destiny to be a world you want to be a part of.
>
> Luke Smith & Chris Barrett

Shortly after releasing the blog post, /u/DeeJ_BNG tweeted out the following:

> Acting Community Manager @A_dmg04 is gathering feedback for a report we'll share across the studio - something that @Cozmo23 has been doing twice a month for more than a year.
>
> You have a voice. We reply with game updates when they are close to being ready.

So, there we have it, a call for feedback, and communiy managers reporting internally. Sweet! It got me thinking and eventually got me to decide to share my feedback, because:

1. I feel addressed by ""_players who want Destiny to be their hobby_"", and
2. I feel that the reasons I can't have Destiny as a hobby right now aren't covered by their update.

I'm going to try to keep my feedback limited to how I perceive the game, instead of proposing a solution that I think fixes the world. I trust Bungie to be able to improve their game, given that they collect enough feedback on how their users perceive Destiny 2.

Some background story: I began playing Destiny shortly after The Taken King was released. I put in quite some time, and ended up playing raids regularly, as well as Trials of Osiris. Trials was what kept me playing in year 3. I like playing PvE aswell as PvP, but PvP is what keeps me and my group of guardians close to Destiny (or any other game).
I'm not playing Destiny 2 much at the moment. I play games for fun (primarily), and as soon as I notice that it becomes a chore, I move on to something new. That said, Destiny 1 has been a game that made other games obsolete. Not many games have achieved that (only Unreal Tournament '99 for as far as I can recall). I have bought the expansion, and am looking forward to playing it.

Anyway, here we go; the reasons that prevent me from returning frequently.

**I feel weak and dumbed down**

My guardian feels slow, and sluggish. When I get hit, it takes ages for me to recover. To me, the game feels more about disengaging than about the space magic I got used to in D1. Some of my abilities are powerful, and fun to use, but the cooldown timer has been increased beyond what I perceive as fun and impressive.

**My weapons feel shallow, trivial**

I have weapons, but they aren't very impressive to me. I'd like my primary weapon to be consistent, and maybe even somewhat boring. In D2, I've got two pretty boring primary weapons, of which some archetypes lack the consistency to make them fun to use, or worth using at all. Power weapons are... powerful, but the ammo economy in both PvE and PvP limit their use. Tickling a boss to death with primary weapons just isn't really my thing.

I really liked having a primary weapon AND a sniper rifle AND a rocket launcher (just to name a random combination of weapons that made me feel more powerful than I feel in D2). I felt stronger, and more versatile. I felt like there were more strategies to choose from, more ways to engage.

I would love to have interesting weapons in D2 like The Last Word, The Gjallerhorn, or the No Land Beyond. Surely, these weapons would be way to strong in the context of D2, but I think this is part of what makes me feel less inclined to return to Destiny.

**I can't enjoy regular PvP activities**

I love PvP, but the activities seem to be exclusive to premade teams of 3 or 4. If I queue up solo, I get matched against these teams, and get shred apart without the ability to make a play. For some reason, the quickplay playlist seems to be sweatier than competitive. 

I like making plays. Flank around. Use the map to my advantage. Use my abilities to turn a game around. Winning a 2v1 gunfight makes me happier than it should. I feel like this isn't possible anymore; I can't really make an impact on a game as an individual anymore. Maybe I'm just that bad.

The result is that I haven't touched any PvP activity as a solo player at all, for quite some time.

**I feel indifferent and unmoved about rewards**

I've gotten to the point that most (if not all) loot just gets dismantled. I don't feel a need to decrypt engrams or look at what it decrypted into. I'd rather just get materials instead; saves me the trouble of dismantling the same stuff over and over again. Moments of joyfulness related to getting a certain weapon or armor piece have been rare.

**I feel too restricted in what I can do**

I guess everyone has their favorite activities. I know I do. But I can't just go into the Destiny universe and play what I like. Just to name a few:

- I can't choose the PvP mode I like to play
- I can play strikes, but to me their length and rewards feel out of sync
- I can't (re)play the story missions I liked
- I can't solo a nightfall due to newly introduced mechanics
- I can't choose which talents of my subclass I want to activate

**I feel less attached to endgame activities**

Playing endgame activities, like raids and Trials of Osiris, has always been my thing. Now, I feel less attached to these activities. 

For one, I'm not really looking forward to the rewards; they are predictable to me. There are less moments of shared joy because of the lack of post game drops. I loved comparing loot and the joy people expressed of getting a new weapon with the right stats, or that one armor piece they were missing. It was satisfying to me, apparently.

Playing ToO is the only activity that draws me back in from time to time, but the lack of interesting gunfights and individual plays makes it less interesting for me to play or watch it.

**Destiny makes me feel adrift; I have no goal to play**

I have no idea _why_ I should return to D2, after completing the main missions and activities. What is there to play for? What is there to grind for? What's left to discover? Why is Destiny a world that I want to be a part of? For some reason, D2 feels empty to me.

"Bungie - just so ya know ... when I solo a Nightfall with more than 100,000 points when the boss is killed, it's not fun to lose 15,000+ points & end up below the 100K bonus threshold just because I'm forced to wait for dialogue to finish & the final chest to appear.",9016,afo9rp,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/afo9rp/bungie_just_so_ya_know_when_i_solo_a_nightfall/,359,1547444454.0,"I may not be one of those YouTube gamers who can finish a NF solo with 200K points but I like to challenge myself sometimes by doing NF's solo using burns and modifiers that can favor both sides at times (ex: max handicap with Arc, Solar or Void singe - whichever one matches the majority of the enemies). Depending on the strike, using a burn that can also help the enemies means there are times when I have to play a little slower. As a result, I sometimes finish a little before or after I start losing points.  
  
However, it's absolutely *absurd* to see that I killed the final boss with 112,000 points only to end up with slightly more than 95,000 just because I had to wait for dialogue to finish and for the chest and rewards to appear. This is ridiculous!  
  
Again - I recognize that I may not be the best player but if I kill the final boss with enough points to qualify for the 100,000 point bonus threshold, I shouldn't have it taken away just because I have to wait for dialogue to finish and for the chest to spawn so I can get credit for finishing the strike.  
  
When combined with the 4th pair of boots I've received from powerful engrams this week, completing the NF went from a frustrating experience to a complete waste of time.  
  
**Bungie** - a player's points should be locked immediately after the final boss is killed at the end of a Nightfall.  
  
**Update**  
  
Wow! First - a bike when I was 12 and now front page on DTG! This got more attention that I thought it would.  
  
I saw a comment or two saying a ""solution"" is to play with a fireteam or 2-man NF's to get more points. While that's an option, I enjoy the challenge of doing them solo dating back to D1 when some of those NF's were quite difficult and took much longer to complete.  
  
Additionally, I work full-time and the majority of my clanmates have either completed their NF runs by the time I can play or they're already in a group doing other activities. Regardless, that doesn't solve the problem in my opinion. I believe the points should be locked immediately after the boss is killed.  
  
Thanks to everyone for the comments.

"Reddit, you surely must realize how it looks when you complain about things you don't understand?",8943,9ey959,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/9ey959/reddit_you_surely_must_realize_how_it_looks_when/,1419,1536706477.0,"There's a post on the [front page](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/9euf5e/bungie_you_surely_must_realize_how_it_looks_when/) (has been removed now) about how when Bungie fixed one issue that helps players but not another one that hurts players that it makes Bungie look bad. But they really don't have a choice.

The game runs in two parts: server side code and client side code. Bungie controls the servers and they can patch/update server side things with ease. This is why they were able to patch the raid chest so quickly. Not everything sits on the server side however...

**EDIT:** Servers also need all the things the client side code does. I left that out cause that part isn't relevant to this post (as it's about the client side code) but since people keep commenting on it I'm adding this. Everything you read in the next section ALSO applies to the server code.

Client side code is the actual application that runs on your platform. In order to update this, they need to do the following: Learn that there is an issue, figure out what causes that issue, fix that issue in a way that doesn't break other things, test that the fix worked, make a new build of the game (this part is done THREE times), send that new build to Microsoft and Sony so that their publishing partners can put it through a certification process (this part costs money and if you fail certification you gotta start all over **EDIT**: This no longer cost money unless you fail a lot, and there are ways to fast track patches through). Once it's passed both, then FINALLY they can deploy the new code to all three platforms at the same time which involved getting the new files onto servers around the globe for millions of people in all different countries can download them.

That's not something that can be done in an hour, or even a day. It's a long process. It's also something that a lot of people at Bungie don't work on. Artists will still make new textures and gear, designers will still make new quests, etc. Also, don't be surprised if the patch that drops today doesn't fix this stuff either. This patch was ready to go before people started finding these issues. I wouldn't be surprised if they have a few more lined up already but idk how quick the turnaround is for them.

Also some bugs are just HARD to fix. You can spend hours looking through code trying to find the root cause of an issue, or spend days trying to fix an issue. Video Game engines are complex beasts. Graphics, audio, sound, particle effects, emitters, AI, physics, matchmaking, VOIP, UI, inventory, databases, third party API support, etc. All this shit is huge, and connects with each other. A change in one area can cause a bug in another. There isn't just a switch that Bungie can flip and all the problems go away. There are several developers who have been up for hours staring at hundreds of lines of code trying to fix a bug that is breaking their game in a negative way. THEY WANT THE BUG FIXED WAY MORE THAN YOU DO.

That doesn't even take into account Bungie reaching out to players. The game ships in 16 languages: English, French, Italian, German, Spanish (Castilian), Spanish (Latin American), Japanese, Portugese, Russian, and Polish for full text and voice acting. Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese get translated text.

So when your Guardian speaks 1 line of dialog... that's Bungie hiring 6 people in 10 different countries. When they publish patch notes they need to translate it 16 times. This Week At Bungie? Needs to be written and then translated SIXTEEN times.

Here's a TWAB about fixing the Heavy Ammo bug in D1 in a ton of different languages (these were the main ones D1 supported. They added MORE with D2). This gives some insight into the process:

* https://www.bungie.net/ja/News/Article/12540

Bungie puts in a hundred times more work than you'll ever see or they will ever talk about. It takes a small army to do all the stuff they do. Literally, Bungie employs ~750 people. And each and every one of them are working to make the best game that they are possible of making. They are on your side and all of this stuff will get fixed.

So just take a deep breath and chill... being angry doesn't mean you get to be rude. Just enjoy the game, stop rushing, and smell the roses before they wilt.

TL;DR: Bungie can't fix the game in a day, no matter how much you will it.

**EDIT:** This isn't a call to stop people from criticizing Bungie or to let them off the hook for something. Just a post to help you understand why game studios can't just patch their game the same day a bug is found. This post is true for ALL game studios and software companies.

**EDIT 2:** According to some commenters I'm a liar and a Bungie shill... so take this whole post with a grain of salt I guess.

"Forsaken is great, but shelving Y1 gear has a negative impact on loot variety. It's just as big a mistake as it was in The Taken King.",8945,9fbfo1,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/9fbfo1/forsaken_is_great_but_shelving_y1_gear_has_a/,941,1536813170.0,"The Issue
----------------

In the Forsaken tab of Collections, there are **five** new Legendary sets per class acquirable though regularly available means:

- 1 set for Strikes

- 1 set for Crucible

- 1 set for Gambit

- 1 set for The Tangled Shore

- 1 set for The Dreaming City

...and **two** sets tied to either timed events or lootboxes:

- 1 for Iron Banner

- 1 for Eververse S4

This makes for a total of **seven** new sets per class -- which I should stress is actually a VERY generous number of new gear sets to add in a Destiny expansion -- and of course we will get an eighth set per class from the Last Wish raid, and there are a few random non-set pieces that drop from various places.

The problem, however, is that these are the only sets in the game now that can ever roll with random perks and elemental resistance Masterworks. Even the blue Forsaken armor pieces are better than Y1 Legendaries because they too can roll with perks. As a result, Y2 sets are now *effectively* the only sets in the game, and we don't even have access to all of them yet.

In the Year 1 tab of Collections...oh boy. Bungie have left behind a whopping **TWENTY-SEVEN** armor sets PER CLASS acquirable though regularly available means -- note that I'm counting Ornaments as armor sets because A) this post is intended to stress my yearning for the past variety of aesthetic options in Destiny 2, and B) Ornaments, just as much as the Y1 sets they were attached to, are also earnable cosmetic loot that was left behind from Y1:

- 1 set for Leviathan Raid

- 1 set for Prestige Leviathan (Normal Leviathan reskin)

- 1 set for Eater Of Worlds (with one set of Ornaments)

- 1 set for Spire of Stars (with one set of Ornaments)

- 1 set for Escalation Protocol

- 1 set for Trials S1

- 1 set for Trials S2

- 1 set for EDZ

- 1 set for Io

- 1 set for Titan

- 1 set for Nessus

- 1 set for Mercury

- 1 set for Mars

- 1 set for Strikes (with 2 sets of Ornaments)

- 1 set for Crucible (with 2 sets of Ornaments)

- 1 set from Ikora

- 5 sets from Legendary Engrams

...and **SEVENTEEN** sets tied to either timed events or lootboxes, again counting ornaments as separate ""armor sets"":

- 1 for Iron Banner (with 2 sets of Ornaments)

- 1 for Dead Orbit (with 2 sets of Ornaments)

- 1 for Future War Cult (with 2 sets of Ornaments)

- 1 for New Monarchy (with 2 sets of Ornaments)

- 1 for Eververse S1

- 1 for Eververse S2

- 1 for Eververse S3

- 1 for The Dawning

- 1 for Solstice of Heroes (with 2 sets of Ornaments)

This makes for a total of **FOURTY-FOUR** sets per class that were completely left behind in Forsaken. And of course, that's not even including 281 weapons also left on the table, with 49 weapons in Forsaken including both new skins and recycled skins from Y1.

I should stress that I'm enjoying Forsaken a lot from a pure gameplay perspective. There's so much more fun stuff here now than there ever was in Y1. But these numbers are gut-wrenching for me, having watched Bungie make this mistake twice before (first with Taken King, then with leaving D1 behind for D2).

I paid for the base-game and the expansions, and now all of that stuff is irrelevant. Are we really doing this AGAAIIINNNN?? I hope that for most readers I don't have to elaborate much further on why this isn't right. To be clear though...

I definitely do NOT miss:

- Static rolls.

- 3 columns of perks on weapons.

- Perk-less armor.

- Getting Legendary Engrams every two seconds, thus cheapening them.

However, I definitely DO miss:

- All the ornaments I earned, some of which I got *right* before Forsaken dropped e.g. the rest of the S3 Iron Banner stuff.

- Having a wider overall variety of aesthetic options, in terms of both armor and guns.

- Some weapon archetypes from Y1 that seem to be underrepresented in the new Forsaken loot pool, although this is less of a problem IMO than the lack of aesthetic variety in armor.

Forsaken is in many ways a fresh start for Bungie, and my prediction is that for this reason many in the community will rush to their defense here...but to hopefully preempt some of that, I want to harp on a point that community members sometimes seem to miss:

**An expansion should not be a new game. An expansion should take an existing game...and *expand* it!!**

Forsaken is not an *actual* new start, but a continuation of an MMO called Destiny 2 on which I have now spent around 150 dollars in a little over one year. I'm not trying to say anyone forced me to do that; but, nonetheless, I would still like the value of that steep price of admission to be fully reflected in the product I receive in return.

My suggestion
----------------

All the Y1 gear could be reintroduced without changing the overall rarity of Legendaries as it currently stands. Right now, the new Y2 legendary sets are dropping not only in the new Patrols, but on all planets. When I'm on Io and I do a public event that ends up giving me a drop....instead of more Red Phantom, why not have it be a random-rolled version of the Gensym Knight armor, or a random-rolled version of the Io-specific Death Adder SMG? It just seems like that would make so much more sense, and it would make the loot pool feel a lot more diverse and alive with potential guns to use and potential cosmetics to wear.

I get that Bungie wants us to focus on the two new (awesome) Patrol areas. However:

- There are still plenty of reasons to go elsewhere as things stand, with the increased requirements to grind for materials
- Events like the Flashpoint, stuff like Spider's Bounties and Material Exchange, the Blind Well and the new Raid, and location-based variation in Power Level of drops are all plenty viable ways to keep players in the new Patrols

I don't want to play a Destiny 2 where every player, even vets, are running around in the same 8 sets. I know there will be more in future expansions, but so much great-looking gear was left behind!

Bungie, in a live update or the next expansion, PLEASE update all Y1 gear drops (weapons and armor) with random-rolled perks, just as the new Y2 gear has, and reintroduce it into the loot pool. I want to engage with my old gear and stay consistent with my characters' aesthetic identities just as much as I want to try to mix in new stuff.

**Edit:** I'm excited to see this have such a positive reception. My only hope is that it can be a push for Bungie to acknowledge this as a real player need that isn't being met too well at this point. And to the guy (**edit:** GUYS!!!) who gilded me, thank you.

We're fast approaching the 5th anniversary of Destiny's release, and what a wild ride it's been. But before we even got that far, something truly awesome happened:

We've broken ***ONE MILLION SUBSCRIBERS!!!*** 

*HOLY SHANKS, ZAVALA! That's a lot!* 

Can you believe it? Only 18 months ago, [we broke 500,00 subscribers](https://redd.it/7psm68) (and [dropped back below 500k](https://redd.it/7ynp9l) just so we could [celebrate 500k again](https://redd.it/890g2c)). All in all, a year and a half is a damn good doubling time. 

Another milestone came along 8 months ago, when we [broke 777,777 subscribers](https://redd.it/9y67qh). That's is the kind of milestone we'd only celebrate on a subreddit born of Bungie and their undying love of the number 7, which we naturally inherited.

***

###Becoming Legend

You might be wondering how we got this far. It's been a long (and sometimes bumpy) journey to get here, and it all started ~~on u/Norsefenrir's birthday~~ more than six and a half years ago: 

* This subreddit was created by /u/Cozmo23 on Wednesday, the 5^th of December, 2012, right after the announcement of Destiny.

* We hit **10,000** subscribers on the **19^th of January, 2014**

* We hit **50,000** subscribers on **8^th of September, 2014** (the day before Destiny vanilla launched)

* We hit **100,000** subscribers on the **24^th of September, 2014**.

* We hit **200,000** subscribers on the **7^th of September, 2015**

* We hit **300,000** subscribers on the **7^th of January, 2017** 

* We hit **400,000** subscribers on the **12^th of September, 2017**

* We hit **500,000** subscribers on **11^th of January, 2018**

* We dropped down below **500,000** subscribers on **21^st of March, 2018**

* We broke **500,000** subscribers *a second time* on **2^nd of April, 2018**

* We hit **777,777** subscribers on **18^th of November, 2018** 

You can view all our ups and downs [here](https://i.imgur.com/yS8wcqq.png). As you can see, that brief period of general dissatisfaction in early 2018 was just a tiny blip in our history. We've been soaring high ever since, with continuous and sizable growth since the Go-Fast update in March 2018. 

###Where We Stand Today

So we did it. Where does 1,000,000 leave us in comparison to the rest of Reddit?

- At the time of writing, we are the 225th largest sub overall. 

- Not impressed? Try this out for size: We're the 35th most active sub by comment count, and the 24th most active sub by post count. 

- When it comes to other gaming subreddits, we are the 17th largest gaming sub, and the 9th largest gaming sub dedicated to a single franchise. 

###Guardians' Comings & Goings

Besides farming salt, what do all our subscribers tend to do around here? Here are some traffic stats for the past year:

- Visitors per month were greatest in September 2018, with 3,112,513 unique visitors (both logged in and logged out). The lowest number of visitors was in February, with 1,625,252 unique visitors

- The current all-time record for visitors is still the launch month of Destiny 2, which brought 3,784,610 unique viewers to the subreddit.

- In terms of pageviews, the most was also in September, with 109,415,999 (!) page views. Similarly, the lowest was in February, with 29,181,618 page views. Overall, we've ranged between 18 to 30 pageviews per unique visitor per month. 

- Forsaken just barely beat out the launch month of Destiny 2 for page views, with the latter event drawing 105,822,445 page views. 

- Mobile users continue to make up the majority of our user base, followed by app users, new Reddit, and old Reddit users. In June of 2019, their respective counts were:
 - Mobile users (web): 946,207
 - Mobile users (apps): 397,739
 - Desktop users (new Reddit): 353,918
 - Desptop users (old Reddit): 123,528

- App users, however, make the majority of our page views, followed by mobile web, old Reddit, and new Reddit. In June, the pageview counts by platform were:
 - Mobile views (apps): 21,904,954
 - Mobile views (web): 5,646,921
 - Desktop views (old Reddit): 4,206,776
 - Desktop views (new Reddit): 3,662,091

- We've had fairly steady growth over the past few months, typically ranging between one 1000 and 2000 new subscribers per day. At the same time, we've had an average of between 300 and 400 users unsubscribe, so overall, we've been gaining an average of about a thousand users a day for the past year. 

***

###Movie Time!

To commemorate this momentous occasion, our team put together some special videos to celebrate. First up, here's a few words from our **Senior Not-Bungie Animator** u/ChrisDAnimation:

>Hello! I've been a member of this particular little slice of the Destiny community for almost 4 years, and as a way of saying thanks to everyone here who subscribes and participates on DTG, I've used my After Effects ~~super~~ wizardry to help craft this little thank you video. u/Hawkmoona_Matata and u/CaptainCosmodrome were nice enough to commission a well-known voiceover artist to say some inspirational words, and I ran with what they delivered.

>Enjoy,

>— ChrisDAnimation

Now, if you're here, it's a pretty safe bet that you probably like Destiny. Perhaps maybe a little too much. So much so that you've turned the games' best (and worst) moments into something truly unforgettable. To celebrate how much we enjoy how much we all love this game, u/Hawkmoona_Matata put together a compilation of all our best memes.

Stop nerfing things that make the game fun and make us feel powerful. Instead bungie you should focus on improving the exotics that get no use and buff them.

**There was no reason to change the Primary/Special/Heavy system.** It was perfect and had just the right amount of balance/fun. Snipers and shotguns were actually viable because they didn’t have to compete with rocket launchers. Could you imagine if Gjallarhorn came back in D2? Might as well rename the power slot to the Gjallarhorn slot. 

**There was no reason to nerf movement speed.**I loved Warlock surfing, I loved Titan skating, I loved Bones of Eao Better Control Jump hunter. When I would grind strikes on end for hours, what kept me playing for those hours was the fact that I could smash my A/X button and fly past enemies, on whichever class I wanted. It was FUN. 

**There was no reason to nerf the TTK in PvP again.** Whenever I explain how Destiny’s sandbox degraded to people, I always mention the fact that the first 3 years of Destiny, all
the sandbox team did was nerf after nerf. And then with Destiny 2, they decided to unleash one MASSIVE nerf to everything in the game. Perks, Weapons, Abilities, just cause they wanted too. We would ask them to slightly nerf a certain perk, they would decide to destroy a whole weapon class. We asked them to nerf Firebolt DOT and damage, they completely destroyed the Firebolt grenade by nerfing radius and activation time.

The sandbox team has a fundamental problem of trying to reinvent the wheel and doing things according to their data, when in reality they should be listening to specific feedback from the players. 

Examples of the Sandbox Team completely disregarding player feedback and input, and making unnecessary changes/nerfs:

- The first shoulder charge nerf of Destiny 2's first and only sandbox update. (Who asked for this? Why do you continue to nerf after the thing people complain about the most is that you nerf way too much? Shoulder charge was completely fine and balanced the way it was. Just because you personally felt like it wasn't playing like you intended, doesn't mean it has to be nerfed.)

- In Destiny 1 the constant nerf's to the Bladedancer and Gunslinger subclass, *ex. Tripmine grenade nerf, throwing knife nerf, quickdraw nerf, blade dancer hit dection nerf, arcbolt nerf.* All the while Warlocks ran around with 6 meter melee range and Ophidian Aspects.

- Every single nerf to hand-cannon's after The Taken King. (You nerfed range, you brought in bloom. Hand-cannon's became balanced and were no longer able to compete with scout rifles at long range. What the fuck was the point of nerfing them AGAIN in Rise of Iron? Sure you slightly removed bloom, but then you completely destroyed the range stat.)

- The Firebolt nerf as mentioned earlier. Completely destroying this grenade and making it effectively useless in PvE and PvP. 

The list goes on..

In my opinion Jon Weisnewski and the sandbox team in their arrogance, ignorance and unwillingness to balance the sandbox in favor of the community rather to themselves has become the ultimate downfall of this game and until some major changes are made to the core gameplay of Destiny, I promise you no amount of random rolls and raid loot will fix the dying playerbase, in PvP and PvE. 

Edit: I feel the need to clarify that the community did NOT ask for the state that the sandbox is in right now, since every other comment is saying the community asked for this. The whole point of this post is that we did ask for certain changes, but the sandbox team decided to go above and beyond, and go completely overboard with changes we asked for. We asked for stronger primaries, instead of making it so players had 1 strong primary weapon, they made it so players had 2 weak primary weapons.",2018-01-30 13:58:48

- Zavala once loved a mortal woman named Lindiwe. She died of old age, and watching her slowly fade away killed Zavala, as he is a Guardian and does not age. Because of this Zavala has avoided relationships since, as he feels he cannot carry another burden, let alone just one.

- The only time we know of Shaxx ever removing his helmet, was when Zavala was spreading Lindiwe's ashes, as a sign of respect.

- Shaxx is a player, and is known for being romantically involved with both Guardians and Mortals

- Shaxx has never had a bad break up, all of them still love him.

- Shaxx lost his horn after getting his buns beat in Crucible by Ikora.

- Good guy Shaxx once held a dying Ahamkara in his arms, so that it could die peacefully.

- Cool guy Shaxx can recite poetry by heart

- Alpha Male Shaxx banged Mara, and then got her a Recurve Bow as a gift.

- Shaxx loves doggos (Luna's Howl steps)

- Shaxx and Sjur were good friends, their first interaction resulted in Sjur killing Shaxx with a bow when he was caught trespassing on Awoken space.

- Sjur and Mithraax were also very close friends. Sjur captured Mithraax and brought him to the Dreaming City, eventually releasing him peacefully after catching Mithraax after he almost fell down the cliff at the Gardens in the DC. It is implied they accompanied each other for quite some time. Mithraax has gone to Sjur's rest with a fireteam to pay his respects to her.

- Cayde-6 does not know if Ace ever truly existed, it is possible that a previous version of himself made up the idea of Ace so that he could not lose touch of who he is, or his morality.

- Cayde-6 was the body guard for a prominant Ishtar scientist, Maya Sundaresh.

- Cayde-6 ran with the Drifter at some point in the past, to what extent we do not know yet.

- The Traveler was reffered to as ""Moon X"" when it was first discovered, it got it's name after during a basketball game involving the Ares crew. Evie came up with the name Traveler after one of them traveled.

- There was originally 4 members of the Ares One crew, however, you only see the 3 that made it in the opening Destiny trailer.

- Rasputin, in some form, was used for the Ares mission, and was kept extremely top secret. Only 2 members of the crew knew about it and it's full potential. More importantly that Rasputin was sentient.

- Evie (part of the crew) realized the ship AI (Rasputin) was creating assesments of the crew, the mission and itself, without any input. She became suspicious that Mihaylove was hiding something.

- Evie then died during an ""electrical fire"" accident the day of the launch, pushing it back a day. It is HEAVILY implied that Rasputin killed her because he found out about him and could potentially out his extremely dangerous capabilities.

- As a result of the push back the crew was armed for the mission.

- A former Hunter Vanguard Tallulah Fairwind, played poker with Caliban-8, and an Ahamkara posing as an old woman. If Tallulah lost, the Ahamkara would feast. Ahamkara don't lose.

- An Ahamkara fullfilled Shinobu's by taking the form of her Mother. They spoke, and the Ahamkara said details about her life that made her believe it was her mother. All she wanted was to see her again. She cried when she allowed Nadiya to kill her, because all she saw was her mother smiling back.

- Calus' wine is made of planets.

- Calus castrated the Consul.

- The Consul is the guy who found Ghaul.

- Ghaul's teacher and father didn't have a dick.

- Match, Shadow Counselor to the True Emperor, was most likely the last person to ever see Calus in the flesh.

- Calus' proxy is described as being just as ""sensual"" as actual Calus, and even relaxed in the Royal Baths.

- Calus, upon finding out Match was worshipping his own religion in front of Calus, decided to build a temple for his so he can worship without fear. Calus only asked to be in his prayers.

- Calus is a good space dad

- Calus is a crazy space dad

- Uldren got rezzed as a LIGHT BEARER, by a Ghost named Pulled Pork

- Pulled Pork is kind of an idiot, or at the very least very unaware of a lot of things, naive.

- His name is Pulled Pork

- A guardian died after trying to pop their super while jumping off a building. They released they had lost their light, and subsequently fell to their death.

- The Drifter is a cool space uncle

- The Drifter is also a crazy space uncle

- The Drifter is Dredgen Hope, also known as Eli, also known as Wu Ming.

- The Drifter ran a bar for a while

- The Drifter eats a lot of crazy things because he was stuck on a frozen planet, constantly dying of starvation. That's why he has a lot of lines wondering how things taste.

- It is sort of implied that the Drifter and Emissary were previously lovers, or just extremely close friends (F for friend zone). Drifter is not exactly a big fan of the Nine because of what they did to her.

- The Nine released Skolas

- Skolas actually was a good guy. All he was trying to do was unite the Fallen so that they can return to their glory. Sure he did a lot of bad things but he was looking out for his people.

- Mithraax can one hit kill Dregs

- Variks was the person who released Uldren, and the Barons. He did it as a final thank you to his prince.

- Variks left the Prison of Elders with basically all of the Ether left. A vandal saw him on the way out, and basically wished him the best.

- Variks gave Cayde the most OP Destiny 1 weapon, Dreg's Promise, as a way to bribe him.

- Petra is missing an eye.

- Petra loves field work.

- Petra did not expect to be given the role of Queens Wrath following Sjur's death, making her the 2nd.

- Mara wasn't the first Awoken Queen. She was made Queen however following public approval, and because the previous Queen was too focused on clout and being regal.

- Eris is missing twice as many eyes as Petra, but also has three times as many eyes.

- Eris's eyes are Acolyte eyes

- Eris watched her entire team getting murdered and had her eyes cut out, and lost her connection to the Light. Had to crawl in the dark of the Hellmouth, found an Ahamkara bone, and has PTSD

- Oryx is transgender. Aurash was a woman, then became a man when she became Oryx

Playing Anthem makes me appreciate Destiny 2 SO much more,8724,at46oy,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/at46oy/playing_anthem_makes_me_appreciate_destiny_2_so/,1701,1550790598.0,"I will NEVER EVER complain about a loading screen in Destiny 2 again...Wholly s\*t.

It's amazing how much I've taken for granted.

Like being able to customize my gear  and abilities when flying into free-roam, or a strike, or any friggin activity in the game.

Being able to look at ANY of the world maps and peep whether or not a public even is happening....whilst loading into any activity in the game!

Being able to read LORE when loading into an activity..

Being able to track quests and set waypoints and go into a cave or an adventure quest or a patrol....all without a loading screen, virtually.

Being able to look at anyone’s loadout at any time...

And the gunplay....sweet SWEET Destiny gunplay...I've treated you so poorly and you are a wonder to behold. Being able to actually CARE about the guns I'm carrying....being able to actually HEAR enemy npcs talk and roar when I encounter them. Being able to FEEL the impact of when I unleash my Super ability, and to see the magnificent sparks that fly when I roast an entire sector of HIVE....Being able to FEEL space and time compress as I send a meatball back to the hell from which it came....literal tears.

&#x200B;

We all complained about several things when Destiny 2 launched...it was a big step backwards from where we left off from D1...but wholly s\*t, you know what I could DO when D2 launched?

I could play a pretty damn decent campaign, or I could jump RIGHT into PvP and level up all the same.

I could do Adventure Quests...I could do a few strikes...a week later I had a RAID!!

And you know what?  Leviathan wasn't the best raid. Most people complained about how mechanical it was. I actually liked it but tend to agree with the complaints. But hot damn, the entire encounter was BEAUTIFULLY built and seamless as hell.

&#x200B;

I LOVE this game.

I'm willing to call it the best looter next to Borderlands 2, and even then Destiny 2 does WAY more in its icorporation of multiplayer and cooperative play.

Speaking of that, you know what's SUPER EASY to navigate in Destiny 2?  The damn menus.

Oh s\*t....my best friend is online, lets see if he wants to do Shattered Throne.

**\*Holds menu button...scrolls down to friend, sends invite...friend joins in 5 seconds....we are in Shattered Throne 30 seconds later\***

&#x200B;

You get my point. I don't want to s\*t on anyone who likes Anthem, you can like whatever the hell you want. Heck, I like Anthem a little bit...there is a sparkle of fun in there. But mostly I think it's lazy garbage. I want it to be good. It's just not right now.

&#x200B;

OBVIOUSLY D2 has its issues.  There are SO many QOL changes that need to be made, and we are in desperate need of more content, even if it’s older content that can be updated.  And the loot game has definitely taken a dip. I'm not sure what Bungie has planned for the future of the game, but right now it's feeling like that same old limbo.

&#x200B;

But damn, Bungie has done SOOO much right and I never really saw how much until I experienced EVERYTHING Anthem is doing wrong.

I don't think we should accept reskins as raid loot.,8646,cxrz0v,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/cxrz0v/i_dont_think_we_should_accept_reskins_as_raid_loot/,2546,1567256498.0,"#Edit, *la finale*: we got an [official response about the state of the armor](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/cxrz0v/i_dont_think_we_should_accept_reskins_as_raid_loot/eyok19l/?context=1000) and are getting more information soon. It'd be nice if we give them some slack and then see what they have to present for further discussions.

~~TL;DR: Pax west leaked the Garden of Salvation raid armor for hunters (and [titans](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/cxrz0v/i_dont_think_we_should_accept_reskins_as_raid_loot/eyn1r8l/)), which is a reskin of a CoO Eververse armor set, instead of providing a new set of Black Garden themed armor, which we previously saw in the Shadowkeep ViDoc.~~

~~Not TL;DR:~~

~~Earlier this day, [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/cxqahr/new_exotic_trace_rifle_divinity_found_in_black/) revealed the new Exotic trace rifle, Divinity. OP pointed out that it is found in the raid collection, meaning the armor that is found along side it, is the raid armor set for the hunter from the Garden of Salvation raid.~~

~~The issue with that being, that the armor is basically a [reskin of the Curse of Osiris Omega Mechanos Eververse armor set.](https://i.imgur.com/2he6JZL.png)~~

~~Now, where is the issue with that, I hear you ask? Well, the issue is that we had a preview as to [what the Garden of Salvation
 raid armor initially could have been,](https://i.imgur.com/5SlyRye.png) as it was seen in the [first Shadowkeep ViDoc.](https://youtu.be/JlLggoGgLGA?t=310)~~

~~Now, why this is upsetting, I hear you ask? Well, this is upsetting, because the armor we could have gotten as a raid reward, was *could have been* moved into the monetization section of the game, namely, [the Season of the Undying universal ornaments](https://i.imgur.com/Y0X8Eft.png).~~

~~If you compare those 2 sets, you can see [that they're basically identical](https://i.imgur.com/a1KccZl.png), with model changes made to the hunter and titan helmet, plus the texture changes to account for the Black Garden theme.~~

~~This change in the aesthetic of a previously leaked armor, with an obvious black garden theme, with the Season of the Undying not being centered around the black garden, with the Season of the Undying universal armor set looking just like the previously leaked armor that was hypothesized to be the Garden of Salvation raid armor, while the actual Garden of Salvation raid armor is a reskin, makes it look like that they decided to use the better-looking armor set as an incentive for their monetizations, after changing it up a bit to fit the Season of the Undying theme more appropriately.~~

~~This is quite the bummer because getting the Black Garden themed Vex armor would have felt like a thing we asked for years to return to D2, where we basically scavenge the enemies we defeat for their stuff and use it for ourselves and with that in mind, I'm looking way less forward to playing the raid, now that I know that the armor it will reward is just reskins with glows slapped onto them.~~

~~Now, what can we do about it? Well, we can provide *constructive* ***and*** *respectful* feedback and hope the devs see that we're not pleased with the decision to axe the supposed raid armor to use it as bait for people to buy into the Season of the Undying.~~

~~What do you think of this whole situation, let's give your feedback down below.~~

~~***Edit***: Added link to the comment that highlights the existence of Garden of Salvation Titan raid armor leaks.~~

~~***Edit the 2nd***: Phrasing, as been made apparent by [following comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/cxrz0v/i_dont_think_we_should_accept_reskins_as_raid_loot/eynlmqv/).~~",2019-08-31 21:01:38

"Gambit games are too long for the rewards they offer. Round 3 should be a ""sudden death"" mode where the primeval is instantly summoned for both sides to make things quicker",8646,a79xiu,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/a79xiu/gambit_games_are_too_long_for_the_rewards_they/,1005,1545157705.0,"It seems that there lot of people throwing games because they would rather be sure to lose two rounds quickly than risk going three rounds, for basically the same rewards. 

Right now, there is very little incentive to win at gambit and if you win one round and the enemy team wins one the game goes for substantially longer for both teams, which punishes everyone if your goal is fast match compleitons for fast rewards (daily gambit match, weekly gambit matches, etc...).

**A solution to this could be to have the third round be a sudden death round - the primeval is instantly summoned for both teams, the mote gathering phase is skipped and its a race to the finish.**

This would make it more appealing to try to win round 2 if you already lost round one as if you win round 2 you only have to win the sudden death to win the match. It would also add some more variety and excitement to gambit.

This would likely require some adjustment of triumphs however (especially the ones to summon 7 large blockers which basically requires a full three round match to accomplish). 

**Related/Alternate ideas:**

* **Add a a ""qucikplay"" version of gambit that only lasts one round instead of 2-3 as an alternative for people who want to enjoy shorter matches, but keep the current structure for people who enjoy long matches**
* **Significantly shorten the mote gathering phase in round 3** by making a HVT spawn every single wave and doubling all mote drops from all enemies
* Rewards - Add **gambit tokens** (more for wins, less for losses like crucible) which can be turned into the drifter for nonpowerful reward packages
* Rewards - Add **skeleton keys** as possible drops for gambit (more chance if you win), crucible (more chance if you win), and strikes. Opening a chest at the end of a strike with a skeleton key grants strike specific loot like in Destiny 1.",2018-12-19 02:28:25

And for people saying that you just need to find gear you like, I would like to add that, for some people, we don't just switch out gear frequently, but colours as well; in Destiny 1, I'd change Shader based on what mission or location I was going to, to have matching camouflage for the environment.

Hiraks the Mindbender didn't deserve to be killed with the rest of the barons.,8564,9lb3mt,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/9lb3mt/hiraks_the_mindbender_didnt_deserve_to_be_killed/,981,1538681987.0,"Obligatory minor Lore spoilers. 

It's a rare day I feel bad for killing damn near anything in Destiny. But Hiraks? Well, he had a better future ahead of him. But the day he became a baron, that was the day he died. 

Hiraks started out as a dreg on the moon. You know what that means? That's the House of Exile. A house only in name, formed from the outcasts of the outcasts. Fallen who are more desperate, more downtrodden than all their brethren. And Hiraks? The last of a crew who had all met their end on the moon. 

Nobody knows how or why he fell into the hellmouth, just that he did. And he survived. I don't know about you, but I'm pretty sure he must have been blessed by the architects to not be powdered dreg at the bottom, worm food for the worm gods. And not only that, he survived without ether, and grew, without ether. This is not just any exceptional feat. Ether is not just food or drink or oxygen, it's all of those and more. It's a godly ambrosia, both needed and coveted by the fallen. Without it, a fallen will shrivel up like a prune. With it, he will swell into a mighty warrior. 

Hiraks didn't need Ether. He didn't need anything. He delved into the secrets of the hive and made them his own. Like Eris. Like Toland. Like Mara Sov. But unlike all of these great and powerful figures, he did it himself, with his own hands, with his own power, meager as it was. 

And he rose up out of the hellmouth, setting off on a journey to acquire what was probably the closest thing to happiness someone like him could hope for. Hard working Hiraks carved out a space for himself on the Tangled Shore, a lawless, unfortunate place nobody would miss. Somewhere along the line, he found himself a wife, In Anânh, who would leave the hive hierarchy to join him in his pursuits. Pursuits that found him taking leadership of the hive who had washed up on the tangled shore, hive who would almost certainly rejoin the main forces or feed another hive entity who stumbled upon them. In essence, cleaning up the tangled shore. 

His greatest pursuit though? Creating a Throne World for himself, to cement his family and their place in this world. To give them what was never given to him: a place in this harsh world. 

Hiraks's story is one of success. From exile to the abyss to as close to a white picket fence as someone can get in the utter insanity so many of us call home. 

But he was there when Cayde died. That was his sin. And for that, everything he ever worked for, his knowledge, his realm, his wife, his home, his dreams for the future: gone, dust on the wind. Nothing more than a footnote in a book of greater names killed by the Guardian. A minor distraction in a game of Queens and Gods.

Rest in peace, Hiraks, the Mindbender. Hiraks, the Ascendant. Hiraks, the hard working. You deserved better.

Here is What is Really Going on with XP in Destiny 2,8543,7eyt90,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/7eyt90/here_is_what_is_really_going_on_with_xp_in/,1117,1511462070.0,"**[Thanks for listening Bungie](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/46494)**

*TLDR – If you earn XP slow, the ingame display is correct. If you play normally, the game drops some XP (~ 50%). If you power-grind XP the game will drop most of your XP (in testing, I managed to lose ~95% of the XP during an ‘enemies moving against each other’ event)*


Recently there have been a few threads here discussing a supposed ‘XP cap’ or XP scaling. I saw posts from a few people who had looked at what happened across a couple of public events, or screenshots showing a large “+12345 XP” number, with a miniscule amount of progress in the bar. Seeing as grinding for Season 1 exclusive items from bright engrams was my only real motivator to play Destiny 2 anymore, I decided to do my own investigation.



**Method**

I went about my testing by recording all of the gameplay on my Hunter for last week. Periodically, I would also record the current amount of ‘XP to a bright engram’ using DIM. Afterwards I would watch through the gameplay, and record every chain of XP I earned into a spreadsheet, along with the timestamp of when it was banked (when the text disappeared from the screen ingame), and how many pixels it contributed to the ingame XP progress bar.


I then created some graphs to overlay what I earned ingame with what DIM showed. Since the XP bar ingame is 360 pixels long, I calculated that 80000 XP/360 pixels= 222.8 (rounded to 225) XP per pixel could be used to estimate how much XP was being recorded in the backend, at a higher frequency than I could get data from DIM.


Many of my values (especially the pixels of progress in the XP bar) have a decent margin of error associated with them, I accept that, but they should be able to be compared among themselves to show trends. Or as a ballpark figure to show that the progress bar does correspond to the XP as shown by the Bungie API via DIM.


All data was recorded during the clarion call.


**Test 1 - First 10 minutes of the week** - [See graph](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/jixik0wre2ub9mj/Initial_Playtime.png?dl=0)

Initially I decided to just play the game how I normally would. Go into patrol on the Flashpoint destination for the week, and do some patrols while hitting up public events. Well Rested buff was active, and I had a +10% ghost.


Where all the XP graphs are flat, or at low gradient, they’re all roughly parallel, meaning that almost no XP is being lost.

Where there’s a sudden jump between 9:22 and 10:48 is when I completed a patrol mission. Note that the Estimated Recorded XP jumps by only half as much – 6000 XP : 3375 XP (56% recorded)

When the public event ended at roughly 13:41, again the yellow Estimated Recorded XP only rises by half the value that was displayed ingame -19800 XP : 9450 XP (48% recorded)

Note that the DIM XP went up by slightly more than my estimation, meaning that my pixel measurements were on average smaller than they should be, but not by much.

It’s also worth noticing that the orange XP per Pixel line stayed between 200 and 500 XP/pixel.


**Test 2 – Lots of XP during Public Events?** - [See Graph](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/9gcelzrw48uwwlp/Public_Event.png?dl=0)

Later on in my playtime I was doing a Glimmer Drill public event, immediately followed by an ‘Enemies Moving Against Each Other’ event. This was the period where I was consistently earning lots of XP, and banked two of my largest chains back-to-back. During this period I had Well Rested, but no ghost.

The biggest thing to take from this is that the Estimated Recorded XP was roughly flat for the duration of both events, while the Ingame XP skyrocketed. Across the two events I earned nearly 7.5x more XP ingame than was recorded in DIM – 53832 XP : 7200 XP (13.4% recorded)

For the Public Event completion XP and the chain of almost every enemy I killed during the ‘moving against each other’ the ratios were – 17070 XP : 1125 XP (6.5% recorded) and 17046 XP : 675 XP (4% recorded) respectively

The XP per pixel measure peaks at 5682, compared to <500 for Test 1, then drops back to <500 as soon as the events finish, and I stop earning XP at the high rates. The scaling rate dropped back to ~50% across 60 to 90 seconds, during which I died, and then banked a couple of smaller XP chains.

After it dropped back, I earned more real progress with those 3 small chains in 2 minutes than I had throughout the preceding 6 minutes of public events and crazy killing.


**Test 3 – Earn it slow. Get what you deserve?** - 
[See graph](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/liivxy10awc1fws/Slow_XP.png?dl=0)

After seeing the above cases I was wondering… what happens if I intentionally earn XP at a really slow rate… will DIM still show less earned than ingame?

This time I killed one enemy at a time. Waited for the chain to bank, then moved on to the next enemy.

No estimations required this time. Across a 9 minute period the ingame tally and DIM lined up EXACTLY – 4149 XP : 4149 XP (100% recorded)

So the XP ingame is correct, and at the same scale as in the API and backend… until you start earning it too fast.


**Conclusions**

The XP displayed ingame is at the same scale as in the API and 3rd party apps.

There is a hidden scaling factor that ramps up as you earn XP more quickly.

The scaling factor will increase at least to the point where you’re only really earning 4% of what you should.

Public Events will only ever earn you 50% of what they say, as the end of event XP alone is enough to trigger a 50% scaling factor.

To get one thing clear: There is no cap to XP. You can keep earning XP as fast as you want, and you will always be making progress towards that next bright engram. You will just face dramatically diminishing returns the faster you go.

This final graph covers my XP earnings across nearly 3 hours of playtime

[Total Playtime Graph](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/2zqtkdfv95uvs2n/Total_Playtime_Graph.png?dl=0)

Note the “Adjusted Ingame XP Cumulative” is what I would have earned if the Well Rested buff expired when I actually earned 240,000XP, instead of when Bungie’s scaled XP finally reached 240,000. The Calculated Lost XP is then based on that number.

Over the 3 hours I should have earned ~1.5 more bright engrams than I did (129,825 XP).

At the best conversion rates of AUD$76.20/5000 silver and 800 silver for 5 bright engrams, that is the equivalent of AUD$3.96 lost across 3 hours of gameplay.

[Spreadsheet with all the data is here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rvng8lrvhvsswqu/Destiny2_XP_Investigation.xlsx?dl=0)  if people want to look… no I’m not going to make it clean, I already spent enough time on this (even though I will admit I enjoyed getting stuck into some ‘science’)

**Also many thanks to my clan-mates for sticking around to give me the Clarion Call double XP... made this process go MUCH quicker than it would have**

Guess what motherfuckers.

Lightning

&#x200B;

fire hammers.

This is where all the whey-less titan nuggets spout ""Nani the fuck, lightning fire hammers?"" Thats right you virgin betas, im about to welcome you into the land of heavy lifting, hard nipples inducing, titan greatness. I shouldn't be telling you this, but as someone who has fisted many bosses in my 4 years of being a dumbass in heavy armor, I have amassed great amounts of throbbing powerful knowledge.

Ever heard of the \[dunemarchers\]([https://db.destinytracker.com/d2/ru/items/3790373072-dunemarchers](https://db.destinytracker.com/d2/ru/items/3790373072-dunemarchers))? Probably not, because they were pretty fucking awful before Forsaken came out. You know what, they're probably still fucking awful but now they're awful and \*\*cool as hell\*\*.

&#x200B;

The exotic perk is as reads:

ahem

"" Increases sprint speed. Sprinting builds up a static charge. After melee-attacking an enemy, that charge will chain damage to nearby enemies. ""

So what the fuck does this mean? This means that when you were running back to the battle from the gym, you were wearing some socks and at some point you ran over a carpet. This gave you a :b:owerful \[static shock\]([https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0\*wcglmygkNH6FcehM.jpg](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*wcglmygkNH6FcehM.jpg)). Since you have a static shock, your next melee will cause extra damage in the form of chain lightning to your target as well as everything around it. These fast pants are important to reaching literal pseudo  godhood similar to Thor.

Next step: You need the new tree, Code of the Devastator. The melee ability for this tree is throwing your hammer. Your melee is ranged, because Titans dont give a FUCK what the other 2 classes say the basic rules of balance should be. They can continue to listen to Linkin Park and read Harry Potter fanfics or whatever the hell Hunters and Warlocks do.

Anyways, your melee attack for this tree is throwing a hammer. Dunemarchers empower your next melee attack, even if it is some Chad ass ranged move. The result is you throwing hammers that set enemies on fire, and then shock the shit out of them and everything around them. Since you gotta run with your fast pants to pick up your hammer, the next one is immediately charged and you can commence with an endless chain of buttfucking all of your enemies.

Scorn Chieftan with fire shield? Fire shock him.

Uldren complaining that nobody understands him and its not a phase? Fire shock him.

&#x200B;

Wife mad that you spend too much time at the gym like a true titan? Uhhh

&#x200B;

Yeah.

&#x200B;

The power to be Thor has been here the whole fuckin time you betas and I have just bestowed upon you the knowledge of true Chad titan. You better use it to ascend into a chad alpha.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Get fast pants and throw your hammer at shit.

Sadly, I never had time to turn the timeline into the beautiful thing I wanted it to be, and eventually it became super obsolete and the website died a lonely death. Like Master Ives.

But despair not, O Chroniclers Mine, cuz over at DGS we've been hard at work making a new and improved timeline, reading between the lines, figuring everything out, and weaving a beautiful tapestry out of all the threads that Destiny has given us. Let me preface by saying that while we're fairly certain about the order of events laid out here, Destiny gives us no hard dates to work with, and there's necessarily a whole lot of wiggle room.  The next content drop might totally invalidate half of the stuff in here that's taken blood, sweat, and tears to get right *(I'm looking at you, City Age. Efrideet, you can suck it)*.

We did our best to hit all the major events that impact the universe, getting granular enough to get an idea of the major players, but keeping a macro perspective so you can get a bird's-eye-view of the entire Destiny Universe.

Huge thanks to members of the DGS Discord like u/MrDynogames who helped me reorganize events again and again, figure out who was where when, and generally just be a far better brain than me. And even though we haven't recorded a new podcast in... a while... we still have an active community of Lore enthusiasts over there. Feel free to join us!

*(really though - the source document that the timeline was made from is super gnarly, and doesn't have any citations at all. We need help!)*

And, uh, this goes without saying, but... spoiler warning for those of you who've been under a rock for a while.

Raid Guided Games Experience As A Guide,8398,72sbc1,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/72sbc1/raid_guided_games_experience_as_a_guide/,618,1506548398.0,"The Good:

 As a guide team, we have been matched instantly with 2 seekers each time. The lowest light level we encountered was 276, the highest was 295. 

The system is doing it's job. All 4 people were first timers who had never done a raid before and had an enjoyable experience. Both caught on to the mechanics after a few wipes as well. 
We set aside 5 hours per raid, the quickest was done in 2 hours while the longest was done in 3. For reference our average time with our main group of runners is 40min-1hour give or take. 

The Bad: 

The raid guided games needs to be tweaked a bit. The first pair of seekers had the infamous gauntlet death loop and we had to abandon/start a new session entirely. The second pair of seekers got the glitch where after a wipe your orb doesnt appear on the floor and you're stuck spectating at the finale. Once again, we had to abandon and play around with the glitched people leaving/rejoining to fix it.

The issue here isn't the bugs specifically, but the fact that the raid doesn't save checkpoints when done via guided games. If you make it all the way to the end and a gamebreaking bug happens you're left with two options: 1) Pray to the raid gods that it magically gets fixed. 2.) Abandon the guided game and start from scratch. This also creates a problem where if anyone has to leave for any reason, you'll have to abandon the guided game. If a raid ends up taking much longer than expected, I think guides should have the option to be able to rotate clan members in/out. 

Our seekers all reported being in the matchmaking for 45mins on average. There's already a post discussing this aspect so I won't talk much on it here, but something has to be changed there to either match faster or allow seekers to do activities such as patrol while waiting in a ticket.

Overall, guided games does its job semi-well. The lack of checkpoints is a strange decision and not being able to swap guide members out is a bit of an inconvienence. However, taking new raid players through was an enjoyable experience for both sides and not nearly as big of a headache as I admittedly thought it would be. With some adjustments and bug fixes, Bungie might actually have hit a winning formula with this system.

>This is my opinion on the topic.  If you want end-game, top level rewards, you should be expected to do top level, end-game content that is moderately difficult.  I'm sorry that you think the pathetic 240 Nightfall has a ball-bustingly difficult timer, but it does not, even this week.  I'm sorry that you can't just roll over the Nightfall anymore and have free loot thrown at you.  I'm not going to agree with someone who says ""remove the timer and replace it with nothing"" because then we just get the exact same thing as Destiny 1, which was not hard at all.  You wanna replace it with mechanics?  You wanna replace it with bullet sponges?  You wanna replace it with more majors?  I don't care!  Bungie isn't gonna throw mechanics into a strike, so that's out.  People hate bullet sponges, that's out.  People hate more majors, that's out.  ""Replace it with nothing.""  Fine, now you can get free raid loot, free trials loot AND free Nightfall loot for just logging into the game and being in a clan.  I've yet to see a GOOD idea that keeps the difficulty of the Nightfall when replacing the timers, so if you have one, drop it here.  I'm sorry that you actually need to think for a couple of minutes and plan a route through the Nightfall. Hell, I did a run yesterday of the normal Nightfall with someone who just hit 260 and has never ran the strike before, doing very little skipping at all: 6 minutes left on the clock.  At some point, I think some people need to go, ""maybe it's me?"".  End-game activity should be end-game effort.  It's 15-20 minutes to get it done where you gotta focus once per week.  Is that REALLY asking too much?  REALLY?  15 minutes?  But don't worry, because Bungie will succumb to the complaints of the masses and this shit will be nerfed by next expansion anyway, so you only need to deal with it for 3 months.﻿

- Vendors aren’t getting new armor or weapons, even after a whole year. 

- The Moon is a D1 destination, although it has been expanded with new areas for D2 (I don’t really mind this). 

- Raid armor is the Eververse set from CoO. The original/unique Vex-themed armor is with Eververse or (obtainable in the battle pass?) 

- We will be getting best of Y2 engrams. 

- The “nightmares” or our enemies on the moon are also bosses from D1/Vanilla D2.  

- Prophecy weapons coming back but with a different design. 

I’m all for quality over originality, but this can be a bit concerning for some players. The raid armor was a big deal for many people, but a lot of this expansion in itself is content we have seen before.

Edit: Thanks for the awards. Few words: No, not all of us have been asking for D1 content and usually those posts are downvoted. Many people here want new content. This is only $5 less than Forsaken and we are getting substantially less. 

Since many of you are asking for a source on the vendors, here is the german article: [https://www.google.com/amp/s/mein-mmo.de/destiny-2-bungie-gamescom-interview/amp/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app](https://www.google.com/amp/s/mein-mmo.de/destiny-2-bungie-gamescom-interview/amp/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app)

> Will the merchant inventory finally be updated to play with Shadowkeep? The inventory of planetary traders receives an update with the release of Shadowkeep. 

> The weapons of existing dealers are not likely to change in Shadowkeep, but the armor will be converted to Armor 2.0.


Edit #2: I know this post set off a storm.. TBF I didn’t expect it to be this big, I thought I would get downvoted into shreds. **I did not want to be toxic, or spread toxicity, so I apologize for that** (and am paying the price as everyone is personally messaging me terrible things lol).

A UX designer's take on some much needed/requested game features (with visuals),8323,cka5km,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/cka5km/a_ux_designers_take_on_some_much_neededrequested/,443,1564616756.0,"I'm a UX designer, and I love this game. Lately, I've been feeling like certain elements of the game are more work than fun, and they aren't things that need to be work.

Things like buying materials or cashing in materials at any vendor. Repeatedly pressing buttons over and over and over again, only to then have to manage all those items in my inventory. Speaking of inventory, I'm always managing that too, because of a lack of room. Half of my consumables don't even feel like consumables, and some of them (ballistics logs, etc) are in the pursuit tab. Oh... the Pursuits tab :) A mix of actual pursuits, for some reason, some consumables, materials, and containers.

Then there was other things, like in game settings we all want, or being forced to touch down on a planet, and then spend a bunch of time traveling to a forge or other public events that really feel like they need matchmaking.  

So I tried to design some fixes that I thought might be appropriate. Maybe you agree. Maybe you have a better idea! Regardless, I wanted to share, so see below for my thinking, and links to imgur albums to check out the work for yourself.

TLDR: I redesigned some things. Click on the imgur links below to see for yourself.


**Pursuits**

I think most of us agree that the Pursuits tab is a bit confusing at the moment. Before I go any further, I want to say that two others took a stab at a redesign before I did, and I really liked what they did, so what's that old quote? ""Good artists borrow, great artists steal."" I always loved the D1 pursuits screen that came with TTK, so I gravitated a bit more towards u/Storm_Worm5364/ 's [concept](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/c3f9p0/heres_what_i_think_the_pursuits_tab_should_look/). But I thought it could be simplified still. As I mentioned earlier, the pursuits tab is a mix of quests, bounties, and for some reason, some consumables, other items I can trade, and containers. I decided to keep things simple: just quests, just bounties, with quests represented in the more visual D1 style for prominence. As you'll see later on, I moved some things to the inventory tab, where I think they belong a little better.

**Inventory (and mass discard)**

The inventory screen has been bugging me for a while. The first page is labelled ""consumables,"" which some items definitely are, but a lot of items aren't. I decided to add an extra side tab, and break today's consumables into: ""Consumables & Containers,"" and ""Materials & Other Items."" As you'll see the visuals, I think this helps break things up a bit, makes things a bit more focused, and provides some much needed room. Another thing that's been getting to me is how when you discard items, some items discard the entire stack, some discard a single item within the stack. Additionally, I don't understand why managing shaders is so complicated, and if I want to earn shards from discarding, I have to go to the cryptarch. Why can't I just do this here? And why can't I discard multiple entire stacks at once? Well, I tackled that too.

**Material Exchange/Spider**

I'm sure anyone who's forge farming at the moment will relate to this one. For me, I just had a ton of legendary shards that I wanted to start using efficiently. So anytime Spider is selling Simulation Seeds, I've pressed the same button thousands of times, to buy thousands of shards worth. To make things worse, this pattern is repeated when I visit Brother Vance and want to start redeeming those seeds for rank up packages (I've taken a stab at this too, which you'll see later). Even outside of a farming use case, there's been plenty of times I went to buy materials, only to be annoyed with how many times I have to press the same button to make the size of purchase I want, so I tried to fix this by allowing multiple, larger purchase options. 

[Imgur Album](https://imgur.com/a/SSd3qmV)

**Reputation**

Like I mentioned previously, turning in materials for rank up packages is me hitting buttons over and over again. What's the point of turning in 10 or 20 materials at a time, when I need 50 or 100 to rank up? I might be missing a bigger picture here, but in the event I'm not, I took a stab at simplifying your rank up options: 1 press for 1 full rank up, or 1 press to turn in ALL of your materials, and then 1 press for each rank up package earned.

[Imgur Album](https://imgur.com/a/rNG9bpQ)

**Weapon/Armor Choice**

We used to have this, it's gone now, and it gets requested quite frequently: why can we no longer choose weapon or armor when ranking up? The Menagerie has made this less of a issue - if you need a specific weapon or armor slot that's holding back your leveling up, that's made easy now, but what about if you're farming Service Revolvers? Nothing more frustrating than turning in 1000 Vanguard tokens to get mostly armor that you don't need or want, and very few of what you do what. So I took a stab at bringing back an old favorite.

[Imgur Album](https://imgur.com/a/tFqXM6c)

**Launch from Orbit**

This one gets requested a lot: ""Why can't I launch a forge from Orbit?"" Discovering the forges was fun, but going back to them now is just work. I don't stop to appreciate the scenery, it's just a mindless few minutes I have to spend getting to what I really want. Why not launch from Orbit? But let's not stop there. The Menagerie has shown us that large scale public events with a launch from orbit spot, and matchmaking work well. What else is similar? Blind Well and Escalation Protocol. So I've included screens for those activities also.

[Imgur Album](https://imgur.com/a/Errsmm3)

**In Game Settings**

Possibly one of the things I spend the most time managing in this game, is dismantling rare weapons/armor, and cleaning them out of my post master. This one's been asked for forever, but allow me to auto dismantle rare engrams. I took a look at the settings screen, and found a great spot for in game settings, like this one... and maybe others. I'm sure a lot of you will have good ideas for other settings that could exist in this space.

[Imgur Album](https://imgur.com/a/i9EAyMW)

So, that's what I've got. I'm about to head off on a vacation, but I've got another idea in my head that I'd like to figure out and comp up soon, and that's bounties/vendors from orbit. When I've got that figured out, and my visual design skills catch up with my ideas, I'll share that also. For now, let me know what you think, if you like any of these, if you'd do them differently, or if you've got any other ideas you want to pass on that I can comp up.

I also want to give credit where credit is due. I made these comps by taking 100's of in game screenshots, and in a lot of cases, completing recreating layered files for these screens - this is the hard work of the awesome designers at Bungie. I mentioned already but I was inspired by the work of /u/Storm_Worm5364/ and  /u/Pangolin1905/ on the pursuits work, and I was able to find a lot of in game elements from one of the designers of Destiny, Ryan Klaverweide, and this Behance project of his (https://www.behance.net/gallery/60073341/Destiny-2-UI-Visual-Design). So thanks very much, guys/gals!

Edit: Thanks very much for all the kind words, and the gifts. I just wanted to add one additional comment, since a lot of you have mentioned that the developer team has commented on why some of these things aren’t in the game. Sharing these screens was in no way an attempt to say “Look, it’s just that easy,” but rather to visualize what a lot of us are thinking, or asking for, because it really does help to see things, as opposed to just think about them. Obviously you’ve got to work with what you’ve got, and Bungie isn’t going to spend millions of dollars and countless hours to upend the entire game so we can mass delete shaders. But Bungie does listen to it’s players - obviously they care - and it’s important to communicate what we like, what we don’t like, what’s working, what isn’t, so things continue to progress in a positive direction. I’m very happy and grateful for all the great work the people at Bungie do, and for making a game I love to play.",2019-08-01 07:45:56

Hey everyone, 


I wanted to try a little experiment with our communications and put together a longer look at where Destiny has been over the last few months and where it's heading next. I think it's important to take time to reflect on what's happened so we can show you where we're going. 


I'm calling this Director's Cut. Based on how long this ended up being, a key learning from this is ""maybe there's a better way to communicate this than a GIANT WALL OF TEXT!"" Let me know. I also may like doing it in a different format in the future, I'll let you know. 


Today, I'm going to talk about more than just the Destiny game and talk some about how we *build Destiny* and the effects it can have on the team. I think transparency about the game is important and I also want to be transparent about the work required. Sound OK? That's rhetorical, because a wall of text is coming up. 


We're making a lot of changes to Destiny 2 with Shadowkeep and New Light. We want Destiny 2 to be an [amazing action MMO, in a single, evolving world, that you can play anytime, anywhere with your friends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVk4PkTG99o). 


I'm going to keep referencing that. All the time. Until its true. And then, I'm going to keep referencing it until it's good enough.*

##10 Thoughts on the Last Six Months (Looking Back)

Overall, there are some things about Annual Pass that worked out very well and some real learnings for us along the way. The Annual Pass was a big transition for us. We've been moving away from DLC and trying to provide more ongoing reasons to play Destiny. I wanted to start the State of the Game series by looking back at how we got here. I'm going to largely focus on Season of the Drifter to near-present day. 


**We set up a calendar of content, showed you the plan early, and delivered it. **

A lot of you love Destiny for the chase on the way to improving your characters. Between the Annual Pass drops, questlines, and events in between, the team did a great job of providing stuff to do, items to chase, growing fat with strength, et cetera. Destiny history has had many content droughts, but not this year. 


**But, the Annual Pass was harder on the team than we anticipated. **

The scope of what we delivered, the pace that we delivered it, and the overall throughput for Annual Pass takes a toll on the Bungie team. I--and many others--had conversations throughout the year with team members--who had jumped from release to release-- about the grind of working on Destiny. Working on the game was starting to wear people down. Here's an example: 


During the annual pass, we invented new, bespoke ways to earn rewards each season. Black Armory had its bounties, Season of the Drifter had the ""Reckoning Machine,"" Season of Opulence had its Chalice. Each of these mechanics - each with their own lessons - were valuable, but also put the team into an unsustainable development cycle. We needed to develop a more systemic, standardized set of mechanics for progression to keep our teams healthier. 


We're going to take this problem on in D2Y3. 


***



##We have a Powerful sources problem

As the game's weekly sources of Power grew and Destiny grew with it, this  - at times - could really feel like a chore. Each season brought with it new Powerful sources and optimizing your character meant that you were maybe still running three story missions every week or returning to the Dreaming City months after those first few magical trips from last fall.  


I feel like we needed to do a better job of shifting Powerful sources. We could explore things like changing the value of Powerful sources to create new seasonal efficiencies or retire some Powerful sources as we bring new sources into the game. Simply put, I wish we'd been able do more seasonal curation of the game.

##Season of the Drifter Thoughts, Part I

I like Gambit Prime. It felt like a great refinement of Gambit to me. I'd love to hear your thoughts on it. 


Matches end quicker, so it feels more efficient. The invading frequency feels lower, so I can Collect and dunk. I think there's something cool about the roles, although the requirements to get a full set online to inhabit a role meant not enough folks got to appreciate the playstyle diversity. 


In the future, we're going to have to make a choice: Which Gambit is the [Highlander of Gambits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLxDKQ_5FTQ). Prime or Classic. This isn't just about removing stuff from Destiny 2 -- but the game cannot grow infinitely forever --it's about focusing refinements and evolutions to the Gambit ecosystem. We think Gambit is sweet and deserves more ongoing support and we want to ultimately focus that support on whichever mode ends up being the Highlander. There can be only one. 


That said, we hear you that not everyone is excited about a season that overly focuses on one part of the game. Destiny is a game with a lot of breadth and we agree that this season felt too specialized.

##Season of the Drifter Thoughts, Part II aka Let's Talk About Reckoning

*(and Encounter Design)*



The first time I used Phoenix Protocol at home, I knew it was over. It's an exotic coat that refills my Well of Radiance and then refills itself as I ""slay,"" so that I can continue to place my Well of Stand Here to be Borderline Invulnerable and Deal Tons of Damage. [Datto has a great video that talks about](https://youtu.be/gXS5YLs2e0U) Well of Radiance's effect on the PVE game.  


I wondered, *How are we ever going to make content that fairly challenges players again? *


With Reckoning in Season of the Drifter, we got a taste of what kind of content we'd need to build to challenge Protocol-wearing Warlocks. Matchmade encounters that accost you from all directions, plant snipers off in the distance, and put players in between a pincher attack of many whelps, handle it (I wanted to link a thing here, but it's definitely not T for Teen) and giant bosses (also eff you Knight Taken guy). 


This is what it had to be. We were breaking encounter rules left, right, and center on the Reckoning bridge, in no small part due to players in always-active Wells of Radiance becoming invulnerable gods, holding all six infinity stones all the time. 


In Reckoning, we set out to build an activity that could be relatively easy at Tier 1 and scale up to very challenging at Tier 3. We have an internal team here codenamed: Velveeta (they were formed in the wake of the Crota's End modem-unplugging debacle to help find the cheesiest things to do/use in the challenging PVE portions of the game) – these players are some of our craftiest. 


Once Velveeta can get close to beating something, or beat it outright, that becomes an important data point on our ""is this hard enough?"" evaluation. We give them a bunch of tips like ""here's how this works, can you beat it?”, so if they can, it's a good indicator of the action game and gear game working together.  


Let's talk about encounter design. Generally, in activities we expect players to complete alone (dungeons, raids, zero hour-type activities can play by a different set of properties!) or in matchmade groups, there are a number of guidelines we use when we build them. 



* We don't want to spawn enemies behind the player. 
* We want players to play a game of taking space from enemies. 
* We want players to have cover where their shields and health can recharge, or where they get to be smart using geometry, movement, ability and gunplay to dig enemies out of cover, and make interesting decisions about target prioritization. 
* We want players to be able to understand where in the space enemies will come from, and if we're going to reverse the combat front on players (AKA spawn enemies behind them, we want to telegraph that. 
* We use dropships, spawn clouds, audio cues, all kinds of tricks to try and prepare players for reinforcements.
* As character power was dramatically increasing (more on reasons for this increase later on), the encounter rules got thrown out the window. 


To summarize this: Destiny had sweet gear and in order to create challenge in the Reckoning we broke a bunch of our encounter design philosophy. That sweet gear, coupled with the encounter design meant the number of ways to viably/efficiently progress was dramatically reduced. We want Destiny to be a game where you have lots of choices with your character, build what you choose to do, and funneling those choices down to only one in Reckoning is something we don't want to repeat. There's more about damage and player power sprinkled in this update, and even more on the rest. 


Last, last note: I think it's totally sweet when an activity challenges you to use something other than your favorite item. I don't think the whole game should work that way, but when it's time to bust some shields on the Shanks in Zero Hour, I had a use for that Distant Relation scout rifle in my vault. 


***



##Season of the Drifter Thoughts, Part III aka Now Let's Talk about Difficulty and Touch on Sandbox Nerfs

I started to talk about challenge/difficulty above and drifted (heh heh) to encounter difficulty. But, it's all related. 


When the media would come to play our Halo games for an event, we'd always recommend they play the game on Heroic. Heroic changed a bunch about Halo combat – it made enemy weapons more accurate (but not too accurate); enemies would fire more frequently (which made you feel like a hero when you dodged them); it increased projectile speed; and Heroic lowered player outgoing damage (so that the enemies would survive longer and make their way further through their behavior tree - and therefore appear more intelligent). There's more than just the above going on, but that's a quick summary of some of the changes. 


But here's why: we asked the media to play the game on Heroic, because when the game is challenging, *overcoming the challenge feels incredible*. 


Important to note here: Challenge isn't something universal. In an action game, challenge can be largely personal. One person's challenging might be easy to someone else. We've historically thought about the main Destiny campaigns as something we want to be pretty easy (I think D2's campaign was actually too easy at times), and as players push further into the post-game they'd be able to find more challenge. Across Destiny's history we haven't had enough challenge deep into the end game, and that's definitely something on our list as we head toward fall 2019. 


Overcoming challenges is a huge part of what makes an action game's moment-to-moment engaging. Action games are a delicate balance of growing stronger, the game rising up to push back, introducing new challenges that force you to learn/become more powerful/master a new element and -- at their best -- creating the fist pumping moment of celebration when you achieve victory. 


But Destiny has an RPG component, too. And the RPG component is about customization, optimization, and it's a way for players to choose how they overcome challenge. The entire time we've been making Destiny, the action game and the RPG have been fighting. It's the forever war. The RPG has the power to dramatically overcome the action game, and the action game has the power to render the RPG game irrelevant. It's a line - by nature - Destiny will always have to straddle. 


In order to create challenge during Season of the Drifter, we needed to break a bunch of encounter rules, have exotics like Phoenix Protocol basically function like a key (or hope you match with multiple Radiance Warlocks) which then unlocks success in the matchmade encounters of Reckoning. There's a really [good video from Slayerage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGwwnTumFkI) on this in the context of the nerfs we made heading into Season of Opulence. 


Those nerfs also saw Whisper of the Worm get its day in court. If I could turn back time, we'd probably not run Whisper as the original Black Hammer infinite ammo design. However, considering the year before had Destiny 2 feeling very restrictive and power-limited, I think we did the best that we could with the knowledge and intuition we had last summer. 


Whisper was an outlier that lets you stand still at a safe distance, in a pool that makes you borderline invulnerable, never having to reload or relocate for ammo, and allow players to deal piles and piles of damage on giant bosses who aren't threatening. This isn't your fault! It's ours! We're making some stuff too easy and allowing players to circumvent parts of the game! Mechanics that circumvent the ammo game (relocate to pick up ammo bricks) or completely ignore the reload animations (a critical part of weapon tuning) are mechanics that create the kind of outliers that we ultimately have to tamp down before the game spirals into the boss health version of Reckoning bridges. 


The other significant set of changes we made to the game during this time were taking down the Super Snowball exotics. With as powerful as Destiny Supers have become (they are - on the whole - dramatically more powerful than Destiny 1's Supers), using your Super to recover your Super is an amplification to player power that the challenge and difficulty game can't keep up with. But, we're going to talk about Supers much later on.


Difficulty and challenge are important parts of mastery. There are more changes coming in Shadowkeep (buffs to things like Scout Rifles, nerfs to mechanics that circumvent the ammo economy, refactoring of the way damage stacking rules work) -- we're gonna talk about it in the next episode.

##Season of Opulence, Part I: the Pursuits tray is a Caterpillar in a Cocoon–Questlog is the Beautiful Butterfly

I've seen streams and videos of people beating activities in Destiny blindfolded. I cannot imagine developing the muscle memory and memorization (nevermind the thumbskill required) to be good at Destiny with the blast shield down. 


When things fundamentally change in a way that interrupts muscle memory and mastery, it is frustrating. The initial set of changes to the Pursuits tray earlier this year did a few things beyond upsetting muscle memory. It certainly didn't get as far as the team wanted in its initial release and it also didn't feel like an improvement over what previously existed. 


It felt like we started to redecorate your house but we didn't finish it (and sometimes, that's how things in a live game can feel). 


The morning after the Pursuits changes went live, I talked to some folks on the UI team about the feature. They had Reddit open. 


""Have you read it, Luke?"" 

""Nah, I haven't."" 

""Please don't."" 


They were crestfallen. Not just because of the sometimes-harsh-feeling feedback, but because this team wanted make something sweet, exceed your expectations, and meet their own expectations. None of those things happened. We wanted to try something different with Pursuits, in the sense that we knew where we wanted this feature to end up, but that we'd take some iterative steps to get there. I think we've got to do a better job ensuring that while we're remodeling your house, the potential of the renovation is clearer either in the game or via some communication here on the site. 


We want a Questlog with great tracking that can help players prioritize what to do next. 


Oh, and this fall, bounties will be separated from quests and PC players can assign a hot key that takes them directly to the Pursuits menu.

##Season of Opulence, Part II: The Evolving Eververse

Last year, we thought long and hard about Eververse and how we wanted to change the strategy around microtransactions in Destiny.  As some folks have smartly pointed out, MTX is a big part of our business being a live game. I'm not going to say ""MTX funds the studio"" or ""pays for projects like Shadowkeep"" -- it doesn't wholly fund either of those things. But it does help fund ongoing development of Destiny 2, and allows us to fund creative efforts we otherwise couldn't afford. For example: Whisper of the Worm's ornaments were successful enough that it paid [dev cost-wise] for the Zero Hour mission/rewards to be constructed (this shit matters!). 


The storefront, which we launched alongside Season of Opulence is the first part of the strategic shift we're making with MTX. The decision to run old content in Bright Engrams instead of making new Bright Engrams is another part of the shift. We want to believe that our players would rather just buy things they like from the store. Earlier this summer, we detailed a bunch of the changes coming to Bright Dust and Eververse this fall (and if you haven't read that, go [check it out here](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/47935)). 


The storefront is going to get another round of enhancements this fall, too. We're going to move it to the Director, so you don't have go to the Tower and see Tess to interact with it. We're giving it some Class specific content, so if you're on your Titan looking for Titan Universal Ornaments with smaller shoulders, you'll see Titan armor on one of the store's subpages. We're also going to make it so that the pieces you've already acquired from a given set reduce the Silver price of the set. For instance, if you are 3/5 Optimacy set on your Titan, the cost to finish the set in Silver will be reduced by 60%. 


There are some other philosophies here that we haven't made explicitly clear: 


We have made deliberate choices related to cosmetic items and not having them come from gameplay. Gameplay rewards are where you get items, power, mods, perk combinations, stats, triumphs, and titles. The aesthetics for armor blurs the line some – we want players to get cool armor from activities and the world that feel thematic to where they were acquired. Cosmetic items like universal ornaments, weapon ornaments, shaders, ships, sparrows, emotes, and finishers typically come from the store (There are exceptions, but generally speaking, that's how we think about this). 


We are continuing to try and separate capability/gameplay from vanity. Armor 2.0 and Universal Ornaments are big parts of this separation. This is also why Finisher perks are mods that can be socketed into equipment, so that their aesthetic can stand alone. 


As always, we welcome your feedback and thoughts.

##Season of Opulence, Part III: The Menagerie is Sweet

Have you ever been to an amazing party for something like the Super Bowl? It's the kind of party where there is an incredible spread of snacks rolling out throughout the event, amazingly comfortable seating, an A/V system and TV that makes you jealous, and super sweet people to hang out with. Once you've been to this party -- the Super Bowl anywhere else never feels the same (invite me back somedayyyyyyyyy). 


This is how I feel about Escalation Protocol. Once I had the feeling of running around in public bubbles, fighting giant bosses with a bunch of players (even though getting into a good instance of Mars for Protocol was a pain in the butt!), public gameplay never felt the same. At its peak, when you have a bunch of players slaying big ol' bosses, Escalation Protocol is one of the best things we've added to Destiny 2.


The Menagerie - a six-player matchmade activity where you make progress no matter what - is awesome. Its ""learn-by-watching mechanics"" means that it doesn't require communication between players. The way groups can make progress - even if they don't kill the boss - means the real efficiency gain is by learning and executing the fights quickly. Hasapiko, Beloved by Calus -- and also beloved by me -- feels like a great translation of World of Warcraft's Heigan the Unclean** into an action game. 


There's a lot to like about the Menagerie, but I'm going to close the activity part here with: We love the Menagerie, it's a great middle spot on a six-player activity pyramid, with Raids sitting at the top. Escalation Protocol (aka Partying in Public) is a great base. We want to do more activities like this, but in the context of what we learned and in a way that we can better support them over the long-term.

##Season of Opulence, Part IV: The Chalice of Opulence and Somehow Even More Season of the Drifter Thoughts

Having some ways to target and farm some specific gear in Destiny is great. We did a version of this with Black Armory weapons but the very, very long character-specific attunement questline for the Forges was a bit much. We made the Opulence attunement account-wide as a result. 


The Chalice was an even bigger version of targeting rewards. Players could unlock different sets of armor, different weapons, and even select their Masterwork perk roll. 


*Pause on Chalice thoughts. *


We will come back to the Chalice. Let's talk about how we build the game. 


While content for Destiny is released serially, it is largely developed in parallel. For instance, while Forsaken was in its final few months, Black Armory was well underway, and Season of the Drifter was in development while Black Armory was being built, et cetera. For years people have wondered ""Why doesn't release X do the thing content drop Y did? Get it together, Bungie."" 


This is one of the reasons why. So even though Menagerie is sweet, and Chalice is great, while Shadowkeep was being built, the Menagerie and the Chalice hadn't yet been released. So we didn't know how players would react. 


Because we have so much to build, we frequently find ourselves having to place many bets at the same time. This has paid dividends at times – we discover new and awesome things like Escalation Protocol or Menagerie - and this has also resulted in things that feel like setbacks at other times. 


An example of a setback is the reward chase during Season of the Drifter. There are a bunch of super awesome weapons in Drifter (One Two Punch Last Man Standing), but the path to them isn't clear like Black Armory or the Chalice. We didn't do a good enough job of rewarding players for their time or giving them clearer paths to some of the sweet weapons in the release. If we had a do-over with this season's rewards we'd probably have dropped Armor directly from Prime and maybe used Reckoning combined with learnings from Menagerie's fail forward mechanics to let players chase awesome rolls on weapons they could love. While I got pretty lucky with a Rapid Hit Kill Clip Spare Rations, I personally had more fun chasing my Kindled Orchid or Austringer. 


*Unpause. Back to Chalice. *


The Chalice isn't perfect. Being held hostage by THE rune you want to drop from a Strike or Crucible to go make the weapon or armor piece you're coveting is pretty frustrating. 


But having more ways in the game to pursue loot in a deterministic fashion, while preserving the hunt for a great roll, is something that we hope to explore.


***


**Things left unsaid-ish while looking back**



* There's a lot a lot a lot of awesome stuff we didn't spend time talking about (Tribute Hall, Lumina, that cool Drifter cinematic with the Taken Captain, lore books, Vanguard/Drifter choice, et cetera). 


   * Full disclosure: I'm almost always going to focus on opportunities for improvement, rather than celebration! 
* We're in the midst of Solstice and Moments of Triumph so the learnings for those are still bubbling up.  


**Looking Ahead to Looking Ahead**


The rest of the Director’s Cut updates are going to focus on Shadowkeep and the changes we’re making this year. Here are some of the topics that will be included:



* Supers and PVP in Destiny 2
* Armor, Stats, Mods, and Tradeoffs
* Powerful Sources, Prime Engrams and the World
* Damage numbers, damage stacking rules
* And more


I know this is a lot to read (because it was a lot to write). I appreciate you taking the time to make it this far. Like all things with Destiny, it's a journey. The next two parts of this journey will look at the RPG and Combat game.


See you soon, 

Luke Smith


*It's a set of aspirational goals that can help guide the team to create better experiences for players who love Destiny. And it's a simple way to describe how we're thinking about the game to all of you. And even when it's true, there will always be work left to do. And we're committed to it. 


**Fun fact: Heigan the Unclean was often called the ""dance"" boss in the WoW Raid Naxxaramas and Hasapiko means ""the butcher's dance"" in Greek. It's a little nod back to Blizzard's [Xûr reference](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=107109/xurios).",2019-08-14 08:57:22

* Full disclosure, I went flawless 17x in D1, and came very close so many times. It’s not an astronomical amount, but my team and I at least stood a chance. I’m proposing the following changes to encourage novice players to play so that the Trials community will maintain and possibly grow. It’s at least worth a try for a season. While this methodology isn’t proven, I would hope that it would cut down on the toxicity and encourage new players to play

* After going flawless on your hunter (for example), your hunter would be placed in a higher tier where you face teams that have at least one person who has gone flawless

* Your Titan and Warlock would be placed in the normal pool until you’ve gone flawless on those characters

* Competing in the “flawless tier” matchmaking allows you to compete for titles/seals, triumphs, and highly coveted cosmetic rewards

For anyone wondering about getting Microsoft and Sony to refund you if you didn't buy the DLC you're in luck!
This may likely be removed, but Bungie done f%£ked up! Whatever money grabbing idiots are running the show finally went too far so go ahead and contact Sony and Microsoft for your refund while you can. You simply need to tell them that D2 is now broken due to the DLC and can't be completed. What I hear you ask. Well thanks to their utter stupidity Bungie moved an achievement to behind the paywall.

This achievement is on record with Microsoft and Sony as being in the vanilla game! It can't be achieved now without paying for the optional DLC. Yep the prestige achievement has been locked behind the paywall! Your base game is now officially not able to be completed and you can get a refund. Took me just 20 minutes and some back and forth-ing as neither Sony nor Microsoft are aware Bungie did this!

You don't have to even try too hard just make sure the assistant at the other end understands that you can't get all the achievements and thus can't Platinum (Sony) and 100% (Microsoft) the game as it stands. Don't lie though. You don't need to as you and everyone else including S and M will not have known this was going to happen.

Stop punishing people for wanting their loot. You can provide a reasonable barrier without making the game a chore. The gameplay is amazing, you have the hardest part down.

Edit:My line of thinking for masterworking: If you want the enhancement cores to be rare, offer true unique and good perks that make it worthwhile and take it out of infusion. For example, lets say we have a set of armor that we love and want to start grinding for an armor perk that stuns all enemies around us when we are at critical health (cooldown of course) to craft this perk and apply it directly to the armor that we like: you could implement (x amount of enhancement cores, x amount of materials, etc.) The issue of enhancement cores is tied directly to infusion and the little benefits of masterworking in the first place. This would mitigate both because we can craft our own unique set with unique perks the way we like it.

We got an amazing match-made activity, a weapon crafting system, and an amazing raid. THIS is the kind of stuff we want bungie. We would much rather have longer periods between updates as long as we got content like this. 

The menagerie is a perfect example of what activities should be. You’ve got raid like encounters, well made bosses, NO TIME LIMIT (thank god), and blueberries seem to be doing well on figuring out how to do puzzles so obviously you are doing something right. Also that boss was MAGNIFICENT! You can’t really melt him due to his large health pool and he does not feel like one of those bosses where you shoot him twice and he goes immune (fanatic is an example of this). The best part is the boss fight changes it up after each dps phase, with either spawning a new enemy type or changing how the arc walls spawn.

Fine.  Doesn't really bother me, since you're trying to stop the whole ""loot cave"" scenario.

However, I shouldn't have to use Reddit or search through old Bungie Patch Notes to know what's happening to me in game and to learn that I can only loot two Lost Sectors each ten minutes or else receive a lockout debuff.

All you have to do is add a debuff in game right under the pledge buff on my character screen that says something along the lines of, ""Caught: You've been caught snooping around too many Lost Sectors recently and will be temporarily unable to receive Faction Rewards from Lost Sectors."" Then, give that debuff an active countdown timer of 10:00 and I'll know exactly what's happened and you'll have avoided the majority of the fallout. I'll be happier because I'll understand what's happening.

Apply this mentality to everything that appears mysteriously and you'll save a lot of salt and show everyone that you're improving your communication and that you care about your player-base.  We're really not mindless game players and would prefer a bit of explanation.

Pretty simple, I think.

Edit: Thanks everyone for the upvotes and for the attention this is getting.  It's Number 2 on the Front Page and I don't think I'm going to beat out the Architects joke (deservedly so, that one holds first place).  Still, I hope someone from Bungie reads this and acknowledges that this is a great idea and something several of us would like to see.

Not to mention that apart from the final boss fight (which was pretty cool), there was nothing else apart from killing trash mobs. 

The story is also extremely short. Furthermore, Mercury is the smallest planet. It's so small that as someone else posted is probably a scrapped 8v8 PvP map.

Most of the new exotics are from D1. All the cool emotes, sparrows and stuff is gated behind eververse ( Which is ridiculous). 

With all that being said, there is room to enjoy the game. Season 2 comes with new weapons, and some of the dlc weapons are cool and fun to use, and crucible seems a bit fresh). They will fix this stuff eventually, however this is not that update.

Edit- Since this post reached the front page I just want to clarify that I mean no disrespect and I apologise if this post came off as aggressive.

"[Rant] When is Bungie finally going to realize that Destiny is in crisis, and they need to take it seriously?",8012,87xyfa,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/87xyfa/rant_when_is_bungie_finally_going_to_realize_that/,1511,1522321037.0,"So far, Bungie’s ambiguous responses have been made mostly by CMs, and those are usually some variant of “I’ll need to speak to my manager.” The sparse communications from actual developers have been outstanding efforts in creative and innovative ways to make old and long-standing disappointment feel like fresh and renewed disappointment. 

&nbsp;

It’s not going to cut it for much longer. Bungie developers may complain all they want about their dissatisfied customers, but as evidenced by the most salient of Destiny fans, the streamer community, “dissatisfied” is quickly turning into ""bored and uninterested."" In this case, the opposite of “satisfied” isn’t “toxic”: it’s the future absence of paying customers.

&nbsp;

Literally thousands of threads have been made on this and other media, with well-reasoned and explained suggestions for improvement, including meticulously researched facts and data. So much so that more discussion has probably been made on this sub alone than in all of Bungie, and certainly much more than their standard responses to even the most stunningly sensical and useful suggestions: “We’ll look into it,” “We’re listening,” or “We hear you.”

&nbsp;

Sorry, but no-one is that easily satisfied or impressed, with the possible exception of some hiring managers at Bungie.

&nbsp;

Here’s the problem: **Bungie clearly does *not* hear us.**  Every single communication from Bungie’s employees further confirms the well-established fact that the developers are in a self-sustaining feedback bubble. 

&nbsp;

They look at their past successes and the initial sales figures for D2 and smile to themselves, brushing off the overwhelmingly negative feedback from their customers as that of a vocal, ignorant minority and go on imagining themselves to be master *pâtissiers*, acting as if the smallest tuning of a pretend shotgun (likely via changing numbers in a text file) were a supreme effort, imagining themselves as producing perfect croquembouche or soufflés, when the actual product is burnt Wonderbread toast, and it takes nine months, two DLCs and 40,000 begging and pleading suggestions for Bungie to figure out how to butter it on the side facing up. 

&nbsp;

Please don’t tell me to get excited about a “sandbox update” or an “exotic pass.” The mere fact that terms like these are so ubiquitous in the community now just shows the extent to which the game is broken. The fact that it takes Bungie six to eight months to deliver these band-aids indicates how incapable they seem to be of fixing it. 

&nbsp;

Bungie has, by some accounts, nearly 1,000 employees. Surely some of those must be developers and engineers, and surely they can discover a method for the bulk deletion of shaders faster than it takes two humans to court, copulate, gestate, and give live birth, with or without romance. The best of Bungie’s actual accomplishments since Destiny 2’s release have been half-hearted efforts at restoring anemic versions of features better implemented in the past. Their increasingly slippery road maps to improvement have all the feigned earnestness and reliability of a freshly shaved, alcoholic divorcée’s half-hearted promises to their continually disappointed and increasingly estranged children.

&nbsp;

“But it’s a major issue that will take a massive effort to solve!” They say? (How many times have we heard that, and for how many problems?) **Well, then show us a massive effort.** What we’ve seen so far feels far from that, and it’s clearly not working. 

&nbsp;

So fix it. Above all:

&nbsp;

+Fix the fucking weapon categories. Take the Bungie employee immediately above whoever should have slapped the person who thought two primaries was an idea outside, help them fill out an application to work as a whale flenser, then give the other two employees jobs at the White House.

&nbsp;

+Decrease the TTK. If you happen to be employed by Bungie at the moment, let me rephrase: DECREASE THE FUCKING TTK. That is what Destiny players have asked for literally thousands of times, and that is what you need to do. Please do not [“blue curtain”] (https://imgur.com/gallery/QWGrU) this, and do not “Go-Faster” this by again overestimating your literacy or underestimating ours. Please don’t misinterpret “Decrease TTK”  to mean that Destiny players *really* want a roast-beef milkshake, an inflatable ass paddle, involuntary organ donations, or something truly absurd such as **a speed increase that doesn’t actually increase sprint speed** (It boggles the mind! A “go faster” update that *completely overlooks the primary action one normally takes to “go faster”?*) 

&nbsp;

So please don’t pull out your English-to-Non-Sequiter dictionaries, Tarot cards, Ouija boards, divining rods, chicken bones, Fox News commentators or whatever it is you’ve used to botch basic reading comprehension so far, lock the handful of developers you have who believe they know what Destiny players want more than the entire community does in a closet somewhere, stop listening to the opinions of [“sandbox team” members who have to erect a wall of blocked Twitter accounts trying to give helpful critical feedback on the game to better hear the six sycophants who apparently believe that turning the Crucible into Soggy Nerf Pickleball for Mouth Breathers has been a fine idea] (https://twitter.com/sharkeatsman/status/946440747523350528), and fucking *listen* for once: 

&nbsp;

**When the entire community begs and pleads for six months that you decrease TTK, maybe you should just decrease the fucking time to kill.**

&nbsp;

(As in, reduce the number of shots required to kill a player, make primaries more powerful, increase primary weapon damage, have players take more damage when shot with a primary weapon, reduce the number of primary weapon shots a player can survive, boost primary weapon damage, make primary weapons hit harder and kill quicker, or however you need it phrased to understand the point.)

&nbsp;

Here’s the rest:

**PvE:** 
+Decrease ability cooldown, diversify and differentiate class and subclass roles and abilities 
+Deliver two full raids each year with more than one boss encounter each.
+More cohesive and internally consistent narrative and lore, with a return to D1’s complexity, quality, adrenaline, and tone. (Less 4panelcringe and more Black Mirror meets Pacific Rim, please.)
+Implement either a Diablo-esque loot system, or a MHW-esque crafting system
+Return innovative, creative weapon and armor perks benefiting the relevant activities in which they are dropped (i.e. raid/crucible perks)
+Make exotics feel exotic again (originally, they were intended to be “game-changing,” now the only thing they change is how long I have to hold down the button to shard them)
+Less obviously exploitative microtransactions
+In-game, the100-style lfg including Sherpa rewards as well as actual text and voice chat, esp. in social spaces

&nbsp;

**PvP:**
+Update to minimum current standards (dedicated servers, 60fps, etc.)
+Diversify and differentiate class- and subclass roles and abilities
+6v6 (or greater) teams
+Larger and more diverse map types and game modes.
+Selectable game types and more objective-based game types

&nbsp;

Did I mention: Decrease TTK? Thanks for reading, and best of luck to us all.

&nbsp;

Edit: Thanks for the metric ass-ton of gold, and one day I hope to post equally enthusiastic praise about all the improvements to Destiny that haven’t happened yet. Bungie, please make that happen.",2018-03-29 18:57:17
Power Leveling Guide,8003,6ytybz,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/6ytybz/power_leveling_guide/,970,1504895453.0,"Note: Destiny 2 can be played and enjoyed in many ways, so this guide is not for everyone. 

I couldn't get clear information about how power/levels work with the mechanisms for progression in the game, so after a little bit of testing and reading, this is what I've come to understand:

LEVELS

* Leveling 1-20 requires EXP. Most activities in the game give you EXP - the main story, public events, side story, crucible, patrols, lost sectors, and even aimlessly killing mobs. If you just wish to keep up with the story, you normally wont have to go out of your way to meet its level requirements. There is a small jump in requirement near the end, however - one mission requires level 12, while the one after it requires 15 - so for those levels you might want to look at other sources for EXP, but for the most part the story will give you enough to keep up.

* If you finish the campaign and talk to the final npc at the very end, even if you are level 17/18/19, you will be immediately boosted to level 20. 

* Each level 1-20 has a cap in how high Power you can attain in that level; you wont be able to hit 260 Power below level 20. So, there is little to no need to grind for Power in any case before level 20. 

* Level 1-20, in the open world, is scaled to the mobs you are fighting and the public events you do, so you can fight next to a leveled 300 Power player with the same potency at level 5 when it comes to open world mobs. 

* Spend all your glimmer on gear upgrades. Glimmer is of little use at endgame at the moment, so spending it on gear upgrades early on is a great way to level your light and have an easier time in story missions. Staying within 10 light of the recommended light for your questline is optimal. 

* Join a clan early on if possible, clan rewards are another great source of gear. 

At level 20, you start focusing on leveling Power. There are a few interesting mechanics around this:

* Since Power is the average of the best gear in all 8 slots, you must always prioritize your weakest slots as you level.

* Blue engrams and blue drops decrypt from anywhere between -2 to +4 Power level from your overall average Power level. 

* Legendary engrams often decrypt beyond +4 levels from your average Power level, up to a softcap of 265 Power.

* You may receive legendary gear that is beyond 265 Power from vendors; that will be mostly likely because it has a +5 attack/defense Legendary mod on the gear already installed. So you may receive up to 270 gear from vendors on rare occasions. You may also receive just the legendary mods on their own that you can insert into your gear to boost its power by +5. The gunsmith drops these legendary mods, as well as a few exotics, in his rank-up packages. 

* Remember to open your engrams as soon as you get them - their Power is determined by your Power the moment you acquired them, instead of your Power when you decrypt them.

* Spend your glimmer freely: buy 200 Power vendor gear if you aren't there yet, and Scout Reports from Cayde to see all the treasure chests with ease for farming tokens. 

Now, for a short guide to efficient power leveling-

* As a fresh level 20 that just beat the campaign, you are free to do any activity to gain more Power. Your best bet at this point is to stow away certain activities that reward gear past the softcap of 260 for later - specifically, do not turn in milestones, nightfall, exotic weapon questlines, or cayde's treasure maps. Instead, focus on activities that reward blue gear. In order of the fastest to the slowest for attaining blue gear, you can do

   * Public events: around 1-2 blue pieces, chance of legendary and exotic pieces, glimmer and vendor tokens (20 vendor tokens = 1 or 2 legendary pieces). They are by far the fastest if you hop from event to event. However, they can get tedious fairly quickly. Try your best to activate the ""Heroic"" version of these events as they are more likely to give 2 blue pieces instead of 1 upon successful completion and a potentially higher chance at an exotic. 

   * Farming treasure chests, killing yellow bar elite wandering mobs, looting lost sectors, finding regional chests -- all are amazing for getting vendor tokens, but are slower on average than spamming public events when it comes to getting blues. However, when you want to get purples, do these more frequently instead for vendor tokens.
 
   * Side story, vanguard strikes, crucible matches - fun original content but quite slow when it comes to amassing a bunch of blues compared to the methods above. 

Most of these activities will provide you enough blues over time to get 260. While doing these, remember to occasionally open up faction packages when your gear plateaus to get guaranteed legendaries that pull your average higher.

At 260, the softcap for blue gear, you can choose to progress by amassing legendaries. 

* Legendaries go to 265, but at times drop at 270 from vendors because they come premodded. You can also add your own mods to your gear to push it to 270.

* If your only goal is to get these vendor legendaries, focus more on farming tokens instead of public events. Public events have a chance at dropping exotics, but at 260-270, you're better off progressing via guaranteed vendor legendaries and mods. 

* You can also get modded legendaries from crucible/strikes as rare drops that go up to 270.

After 270, the only way to progress is by the methods you patiently saved for yourself this entire time, namely:

* Milestones that reward ""Powerful Gear"" purple engrams. These are on a weekly lockout. 

* Exotic weapon quests that reward various exotics that scale beyond 290 light. Do them when your weapon slot is holding you back.

* Nightfall drops. Weekly lockout.

* Possible Cayde treasure map drops. 

* After 270, your blue and purple random drops will break the softcap but will always be 6-9 below your current average Power. The ""hardcap"" for these blue and random drops will probably always be 6-9 below the max possible light in the game, but we don't have enough info to know that yet. 

Once all of those are dried up, you can choose to progress further by

* Using super high Power weapons/armor to pull your average light level ahead, then using the blue/purple drops to fill your lowest slots. i.e. if you're 279 light b/c you have a 289 exotic, a 279 energy weapon, and a 286 power weapon, your blue/purple will decrypt at 272. If you replace all of your armor with the 272 level, you'll hit 280 or above, and can then go on to unlock another super high powered exotic (comes from quest rewards, or high powered legendary that comes from ""Powerful Gear"" rewards.

* Farming exotic drops from public events, crucible, and strikes. Its slower but its currently the only way to progress outside of weekly lockouts or the raid. If you have two armor or weapon slots that are at max level with two different exotics, you need to infuse one of the exotics into a legendary for it to count in the game's algorithm, as it only takes into account one exotic weapon and one exotic armor when calculating your highest average level. A comment below notes that you should infuse these exotics into legendaries that have a legendary mod on it to end with +5 power above the base infusion.

* Making another character of the same class and transferring gear to take advantage of all the weekly lockouts on that new character. You cannot cross-infuse, so if you make a different class and move over your weapons earlier, you will need to get all of its armor at 270 or so independently grinding it, and then hope to go beyond your previous character's level because you did your weekly lockouts at a higher overall level. This is still slower (but arguably more fun) than making another character of the same class. Your weapons will carry your alt character's light level really well - you can easily get to 265 within an hour or two on a fresh level 20 alt if your weapons are sitting at 280+. 

* u/Oniji says ""You can trade in multiple rare mods for legendary +5 power mods at 280, at the gunsmith. He currently sells mods for every slot except Hunter cloaks.""

* Once you make +5 mods for all of your slots, your drops (that come unmodded most of the time) can be infused to your modded gear to raise your modded gear's level. So if you have a 282 piece that's already modded (base value 277), and you get a 279 drop, you can infuse the 279 drop into the 282 modded piece and it'll go to 284. 

* Dump all your extra glimmer into 'random mod' at the gunsmith so you can build a stockpile of blue mods to make purple mods with.

* More info worth looking at https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/6zn27w/the_real_guide_to_leveling_over_265_in_destiny_2/

Feel free to add in comments anything I missed in this overview, and I'll add it to the list soon as I see it. 


Cheers all, and remember that Destiny is a game designed for fun; if this powerleveling stuff doesn't feel fun to you, there is no need to do it. More than most other games, Destiny has insane catchup mechanics that might invalidate the efficiency of many of these methods in just a few weeks, especially the 270+ progression bit when the raid is released this Wednesday.

And it boils down to how if you try to make your game not have the high highs and low lows that nothing really holds the spark to bring you back hungry for more. Here is a bit from the column he wrote about this.  
  
  The metaphor I'll use for this lesson is a blind date. Before you go on the blind date, you make a list of qualities that matter to you. Now, which is better? Your date hits positively on every metric you set, but there was no chemistry; or you had great chemistry, but not all of the metrics were met. Most people would pick the latter. What does it matter if the person has fewer negatives if they have no strong positives? The goal of a date isn't minimizing negative attributes, it's finding ones to get excited about. Maybe the latter doesn't work out, but it's much more likely to lead to a second date.

Your players don't need to love everything, but they need to love something. Something has to draw them into your game, something they feel strongly about. Don't worry that the players will hate something. Instead, worry that no one will love anything. Things that evoke strong responses will most often evoke strong responses in many directions, meaning it's almost impossible to make some players love something without making other players hate it. In fact, some players enjoy hating what other players love. So stop worrying about evoking a negative response and start worrying about evoking a strong response.

Since they're not on the season roadmap, it's safe to assume that they'll be absent until September, at the very least.

I don't think anyone thought that both Factions and Trials would be disappearing from Destiny for a year at minimum, much less that Factions wouldn't even be mentioned when discussing any of the next four seasons.

I realize this has been brought up a bunch of times, but that's what has me frustrated. When a concern gets raised a great many times with no response, ""we're listening"" also means ""we're ignoring"".",2019-06-18 08:40:27

"Removing all depth from the game ""because casuals"" is insulting to their intelligence. Make the depth understandable instead.",7757,7f8puz,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/7f8puz/removing_all_depth_from_the_game_because_casuals/,681,1511571578.0,"Casual gamers are people who don't have a lot of time to play games. That's it. 

They can still read. They have the same cognitive capacity as anyone else to make decisions on what perks may or may not interact with other perks. They won't foam at the mouth in utter confusion if you give them more than two options on a subclass. They aren't infants that only want to punch aliens and see flashing colors and story be damned.

They just want their time to be respected and not feel like they have to play 8 hrs a day to progress in any meaningful way. That was ""the grind"" that everyone hated in vanilla D1: playing for hours and only having worthless blues to show for it. They don't want to have to go outside the game to know what the story is about. They want to read a perk and know exactly what it does instead of having to scour the internet to see what ""handling"" or ""accuracy"" actually means. 

The solution isn't to strip the game of anything that resembles an rpg element, dumb down the story to a ""villain of the week"" plot, make the loot have unchanging rolls with only one real perk, and reduce all progression to token slot machines. The solution is to make the depth understandable and make activites rewarding for players that don't have a lot of time. 

Give players things to chase and make clear the way to get them. Go deeper into the story and give scannables a reason to be sought out. Make adventures and lost sectors have better value than two tokens and a blue. Give players some actual agency in their character builds other than ""A or B"". Do better and stop using casuals as an excuse for lazy ham fisted design.",2017-11-25 08:59:38

&#x200B;

# Glimmer Extraction Public Event

# 

Each of the 3 waves will have a small generator type thing that spawns on one of the sides that needs to be destroyed. Just gun them down. It is ok if you miss, they will appear on the next stage. When all 3 are destroyed it will activate the heroic and you will have a glimmer pile to defend.

&#x200B;

Locations: EDZ, Nessus, Tangled Shore

&#x200B;

# Ether Delivery (Servitor)

&#x200B;

At around 2/3 to 1/2 health, 3 smaller servitors will spawn, one on each of the 3 sides around the big servitor, you will need to destroy those 3 servitors to go heroic. Beware, burning the boss too fast will give you very little time to kill the servitors, if any at all. Around 1/2 health, limit your dps and watch for those servitors.

&#x200B;

Locations: EDZ, Nessus

&#x200B;

# Fallen Armory (Fallen Walker Tank)

&#x200B;

On this one, there will be 3 bubbles that house scorch cannons inside them. To take down the bubble, you need to pop the spider tank's legs. Once of of the legs are popped, the walker tank will drop charge orbs, run and pick them up and take them to the machines on the sides of the bubbles. Each bubble need 2 orbs to unlock, so you will need to pop 2 legs of the tank to get the needed 6 orbs. Once it is heroic, another walker tank will be brought in and then you just melt the tanks.

&#x200B;

Locations: EDZ, Titan

# 

# Cabal Drill 

&#x200B;

This one you have to pay attention to the percentage of completion while standing in the circle around the drill. At around 32% completed, a small thresher plane will drop from the cabal ship in orbit, once that drops, it does not matter if you stay in the circle. As soon as you see that ship, focus on destroying the ship. Once the ship is destroyed, the heroic will proc and the boss will spawn.

&#x200B;

Locations: EDZ, Nessus, Io

&#x200B;

# Injection Rig

&#x200B;

At the start of this public event, you have a chance of doing damage to the vents needed to make it heroic. You do have a chance to destroy the vents in this time if your dps is good. Once the vents close the actual mechanics start. 1 boss psion will spawn each round. Kill that boss psion and get ready to shoot the vents, the vents open up from the top down. Once the vent is another psion will spawn and it is rinse and repeat until all 3 vents are destroyed. The boss will spawn after all 3 vents and all 3 psions are killed. The first set of vents is at the very top of the machine, the second set is right above the joints of the legs of the machine, and the last vent is on the very bottom portion of the machine.

&#x200B;

Locations: EDZ, Nessus, Mars

&#x200B;

# Witch's Ritual 

&#x200B;

On this public event, there will be 2 plates on which you need to stand. At the beginning, there will be 2 witch's that spawn that have immunity shields on them. Standing on the right plate will take down the right witch's shield and the left plate will take down the left witch's shield. Once the witch's are dead, stay on the plates because to the top right and left of the portal, 2 crystals will spawn in with immunity shields. You will need to stay on the plates to take those shields down and destroy the crystals. Once both crystals are destroyed, the heroic will start.

&#x200B;

Locations: Titan, Mars

&#x200B;

# Taken Blight*** 

&#x200B;

(check bottom of post for more info for secret exotic) On this one, there is the big ass giant blight up in the sky, that when you try to shoot it, it will say immune. On the ground around that blight will be the smaller blights, you will have come across these in the story, but unlike in the story, DO NOT DESTROY the mini blights. To make this event heroic, you need to walk into the mini blight and then get out. Down on the left hand corner of your screen you should see a buff that last about 4-5 seconds. With that buff, you are able to do damage to the big blight in the sky. Once you run out of the buff, you just walk into the blight again to get it again. The first round of this pub event is the hardest to get it heroic on, but it is possible. Once enough damage is done to the big blight, it will open and the boss will spawn.

&#x200B;

Locations: EDZ, Io, Dreaming City

&#x200B;

# Spire Integration 

&#x200B;

Keep vex from middle spire. If you look closely at the middle spire, you should see 3 energy lines going off in 3 separate directions off the top of the spire. Each of the lines will take you to 1 of 3 plates that you need to stand on and guard until the percent bar is full, while also keeping the vex from getting passed to the center. Once all 3 plates are done, it will go heroic. It is worth noting, this is the only heroic that does not end after the final boss is killed. On this event, you need to wait out the timer once the heroic starts. That means just hold your ground and kill everything that moves that isn't a guardian.

&#x200B;

Locations: Nessus, Io

# 

# Cryo Pod 

&#x200B;

Kill enemies to get boss to come out of pod. DO NOT KILL BOSS. You will need to DPS boss to get the mechanic for the heroic, however, I repeat, do not kill boss. Once enough damage is done to boss, and AOE arc field will form on the ground and on each side of the cryo pod, there are 2 vents. Shoot the vents that are steaming to get access to cryo orbs that you pick up and throw at the boss. Once both are thrown, you will need to DPS boss again to get the arc aoe again and 2 more vents to destroy. You need 3 orbs thrown at boss to start the heroic. 1 thing to note, to get rid of the arc aoe once the heroic has started, just throw all 4 orbs.

&#x200B;

Location: Tangled Shore

&#x200B;

# Ether Ritual (Scorn) 

&#x200B;

There will be 1 big servitor in the middle and 3 smaller servitors around the middle. Don't worry, these don't need to be attacked. The smaller servitors will have things that go into the big servitor in the middle, but more on that later. What you need to do is 1 scorn captain will spawn at a time next to one of the 3 smaller servitors. Kill the captain and then watch the servitors. White orbs will start coming out of one of the servitors and start to go to the big one. You will need to destroy each of these orbs and not let any get to the center. An auto riffle is good for this part. Once all 3 captains are dead and the white orbs destroyed, the boss will spawn.

&#x200B;

Locations: Tangled Shore, Dreaming City

# 

# Rift Generator 

&#x200B;

Keep scorn from killing the generator. An abomination will spawn, kill the Abomination and pick up the orb he drops. The first orb dropped will both start the actual process of the public event but also heal the main generator some. The enemies will move spawns, from the center to either one of the sides, and will keep moving after the abominations are killed. Keep an eye on all 3 sides, deep into the left side, front center and right side. After the first orb is slammed on the generator, soon big taken blights will pop up on 2 of the 3 sides. destroy those blights FAST. Both the blights destroyed should proc the heroic. One proc'd kill the 3 wizards that surround the generator and you will be transported into the ascendant plane where you will fight the boss.

&#x200B;

Location: Dreaming City

&#x200B;

# Warsat 

&#x200B;

Stand around the warsat to get the percentage to start going. Eventually a total of 6 wizards will spawn, 2 at a time, each time they spawn. Kill the 2 wizards when they spawn and this will open a shreiker to kill. Kill the sheiker. rinse and repeat for the next 2 groups of wizards and shreikers. once all 6 wizards are killed and the shreikers, that will proc the Heroic.

&#x200B;

Location: Mars

# 

# Vex Crossroads 

&#x200B;

When doing this event you will be launched to each side of the map to areas that are only accessible during this pub event. There will be enemies and a miniboss there to defeat. Defeating the miniboss will drop orbs, one of which needs to be slammed on the middle platform. after slamming and before leaving, go to the back of the room, the one facing away from the main island, and there will be crystals for you to shoot. Shooting these crystals will open up a path for you to get on top of the building. There will be a plate there for you to stand in and activate. Do the same on the other side and the heroic will start. SGA: while on the top of the small areas you launch to, there are golden area chests that you can only get during the pub event. get those while you can.

# ***Whisper of the Worm (secret Exotic during Taken Blight)

&#x200B;

On Friday - Monday (it is recommended you have a full fireteam for this) on Io in the Lost Oasis, when a Taken Blight spawns, there will also be a very powerful taken knight that spawns in one of 3 locations, I cannot remember the other 2 locations, but the main location where I found him is up on the hill in a cave near the Grove of Ulan-Tan. Once you kill the night, on the plateau around where the rally flag spawns for the Taken Blight, there will be a portal for you to interact with. Interacting with this portal will send you and your fire team into a 20 minute timed mission to unlock the exotic sniper Whisper of the Worm. [More info on this mission can be found here.](https://www.shacknews.com/article/106275/how-to-get-the-whisper-of-the-worm-in-destiny-2)

He was looking for some rocks to steal

He was feeling blue from a Midnight Coup,
He was willing to make a deal

When he came across this fireteam
Running Gauntlet and running it hot

And the Emperor jumped up from his throne and said,
""Boys let me tell you what:

I guess you didn’t know it, but I'm against The Darkness too,

And if you're aware of the Vanguard Dare,
I'll make a bet with you

Now you’ve got a decent raid group,
Boy, but give Calus his due

I bet a shader of gold against your soul
'Cause I think I'm stronger than you""

One boy said, ""My name's Datto and it might be a sin,
But I'll take your bet, you'll be paying respects,
'Cause I'm the best there's ever been""

Datto, raise your Whisper up and wait to proc the perk,
'Cause damage won’t be optimal without the Masterwork

And if you win you'll get this gaudy shader made of gold,
But if you lose, you won’t get random rolls!

Then Calus rose and clapped his hands and he said, ""I'll start this show""
And light shot from his fingertips as his shield began to glow

And he threw them in the void room and they tried hard not to miss
Then a band of psions spawned on in, 
And it sounded something like this

(Hope for the Future Interlude)

When Calus finished, Datto said,
""Well you're pretty good fat man
But sit down in that throne right there
And I’ll beat this with my clan!""

Fire in the middle, run, boys, run 

Hunter’s on the plate with a Golden Gun 

Really good damage, hey let’s go! 

Not enough skulls for a one-phase, though

(Math Solo)

The Emperor started sparking and he knew that he'd been beat 
And he laid that golden shader on the ground at Datto’s feet

Datto said, ""Come back at reset 
If you ever want to try again,
I done told you once, you blueberry bitch,
I'm the best there’s ever been""

The real reason why we have to keep collecting Baryon Boughs even though they're useless...,7687,9n0ino,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/9n0ino/the_real_reason_why_we_have_to_keep_collecting/,496,1539214466.0,"Petra knelt before the Oracle, before the voice of her Queen.

""Our forces have a presence throughout the city now, my Queen.  The enemy's numbers are great, but we're holding ground.""

""Excellent work, my Wrath.  And what of our Guardian allies?""

Petra choked back a frustrated sigh.  *What of them, indeed?*  ""They are... extremely helpful, my Queen.  Very eager to help, in fact.  They come to me every day seeking guidance on how they can be of use.""  Her brow furrowed in confusion.  ""Always they demand five tasks every day.  Exactly five.  While having so many Guardians is a boon in this conflict, truth be told I sometimes run out of tasks for them.""

There was silence from the Oracle.  For a moment, Petra wondered whether the engine had ceased connecting to Mara's hideaway, hungry for another offering.  Her fears were allayed and replaced with confusion when two words boomed from the machine.

""Weed pulling.""

Petra cocked her head to one side.  ""Weed pulling, my Queen?""

""Ever since we abandoned the Dreaming City, there have been no gardeners here to uproot any unwanted Baryon saplings.  If you ever have only four tasks for your Guardians to accomplish, and they are so desperate for a fifth, have them uproot these saplings wherever they find them.  Tell them they can even keep the boughs.""

Petra shook her head.  ""With all respect, my Queen, will the Guardians be pleased with such busywork?""

Mara's voice chuckled from the other side of the Oracle.  ""I have known a few Guardians in my time.  If there's one thing they enjoy more than throwing themselves against the Deep, it is collecting useless trinkets and exotic materials.""

Petra shrugged.  Giving it some thought, that sentiment fit fairly accurately with her own experience of Guardians, as well.  ""Your will is my own, my Queen.""

""Carry it out with precision, as you always do, my Wrath.""  And with that, the Oracle was silent once more.",2018-10-11 07:34:26
"Time-gating leveling isn't ""grinding"". It's adapting the Free-2-play model to boost the ""retained players"" numbers to flaunt to ActiVision's Shareholders, and it's bullshit.",7680,8jkwq2,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/8jkwq2/timegating_leveling_isnt_grinding_its_adapting/,1672,1526413507.0,"Time-gating sucks.  It's a model that was developed and made popular in free-2-play games.  In free-2-play games, it's the idea that in order to goad players into paying, the game simply throws up artificial wait timers in their way, be it waiting for crops to grow, castles to build, fuel tanks to refill and so on. They exist to force a player to stop playing something they were enjoying, and either wait anywhere from a half hour to a few days in order to start playing again.


In Destiny 2, Bungie is so terrified that players will reach max level, and their metrics will show a player drop off, that they are using us, using our desire to play the content, to artificially boost their numbers to show the game is successful in ways it may not be.


We are limited to ""Powerful Engrams"" in order to advance past the soft level cap of 345.  Powerful Engrams can only come from Milestones.  Bungie has designed this to do two things:


* Artificially extend the amount of time the player is playing. Players need to play for a minimum of ~6-10 weeks to hit Max PL.
* Force players into areas that look good for the bosses.  *""See!  We had ""X"" number of players in Crucible this week!"".*.


Yeah, because you **forced** players into Crucible.  It's Bungie telling players that they absolutely do not give a shit how they want to play the game.


It is incredibly limiting. It's the game saying *""Hi, weekly player who has little time. You like running Strikes? Screw you! Run Crucible, do PEs on Nessus, and then maybe you can run strikes!"". Oh, and after you run the 3 strikes needed for the Powerful Engram, all your playing after that means absolutely nothing.  See you next week!*


If a player wants to spend the 5 hours a week they get playing running nothing but strikes, they should NOT limited to a single Powerful Engram a week.  They should NOT be locked into a time-gated leveling process so their metrics look good.


Bungie, every single week, I hit a WALL in your game and it forces me to stop playing.  By Friday, I always have the same feeling.. ""I'd love to play Destiny... but why?  I can't do anything...""  ",2018-05-16 03:45:07

Edit: Please understand I am not blaming any other players on the opposing team. They punished us for being down 3v4  when our teammate quit and were very good at predicting the spawns, which is admittedly not very hard to do. This went on for 2-3 minutes until the game ended. I may have been able to escape from one of those spawn situations but by this point I had given up, wasn't thinking straight and was laughing/yelling all at the same time. They would have chased me down anyway. This was to shed a little more light on how broken the spawns can be at times in the crucible.

Part of the problem here is that once we were down a man, the other team was able to dominate the heavy spawns, and then put us into this death cycle. Because there is a timer on respawn, it gives them a chance to reposition to a predicted location where we would be dropping back into the game. Also, at this stage they had all gotten their supers, so were using them on top of heavy while generating more orbs for their teammates. I think power ammo is almost as much of a problem in crucible as the spawn system is.



Second edit: I will tell you how I see these encounters since so many of you are telling me I should look at my radar.
 
Death 1 - Lost a gunfight. This was right off a spawn and I got caught looking the wrong way as the radar showed me the sword hunter in the doorway when I popped out of ADS. GG. 

Death 2 - Spawn kill. Frustrated. 

Death 3 - I spawn in and immediately see red behind me on the radar. I run forward to avoid being shot in the back and in doing so meet two other enemies. Slashed. 

Death 4 - Everything seems OK when I spawn. I run forward and as I do, a radar blip appears almost at the same instant I am met by 3 enemies and a nova bomb to the face. Only way to avoid this would be to run a different direction after spawning. You'll also notice on my death cam another enemy comes up from behind after I die. Inevitable. 

Death 5 - Probably avoidable, had I chose not to shoot at the player. At this point I wasn't really expecting a second nova, and it was too late to try to leave once he started throwing it. Pretty sure my buddy who also died wasn't even looking at his screen anymore or we could have killed him together. Demoralized. 



I'm not the world's best pvp player, but I'm pretty above average. I almost never play warlock and was just trying for some quick daily tokens when we ran into this buzzsaw. 3v4 is very difficult to begin with, but against a team like this it is downright brutal. Blink would have helped me if it was equipped, but I think death was inevitable in every situation but the first. ",2017-10-14 04:56:37

I flailed so hard on the video teleconference to get the attention of my clanmates to grab the remaining Taken strength orbs. ""There weren't any"" clanmate responded. Adrenaline skyrocketed, I rushed upwards and literally got it in time. It was an emotional relief for us as we, the deaf clan, finally seized the moment of clearing the most exciting raid Bungie has released, ever.

Here's the picture- https://i.imgur.com/p5mMMel.jpg

Video of our clear- https://youtu.be/S155zMy102A

For those wondering how we do callouts- we type in the chat for symbols and locations. We use webcam to discuss strategies. We also revised the symbol list because we didn't want to type STANDING BIRD or SITTING BIRD, we simply summarized it into initials, however sitting bird and standing bird both share the same initials so we renamed sitting bird into BS (bullshitting bird). It was an inside joke. We also rearranged the location of Riven's eyes (originally L1-L5/R1-R5) by using numbers from 1 to 10.

I just still couldn't believe it.

**EDIT:** Just woke up and went to check my recorded files, discovered I didn't record the video teleconference which devastated me. I only recorded the game. For those wondering what software did I use to converse in ASL (American Sign Language), it's Zoom. I can also upload our revised pictures of symbol list, Riven's eye location and symbol location if you guys want ([album](https://imgur.com/a/o9KQOjz)). Am in progress of editing a video and will upload via Youtube.

Thanks for the gold but I don't really need it. My deaf clan did a lot of trial and error until we understood the mechanics and relayed the information to our clanmates because sometimes guides weren't resourceful.

For Kalli, we usually have three groups of two per symbol and for doors, we took the idea from a hearing LFG friend (thanks Sidenote!) who suggested using page count. Summoning Ritual bounty was challenging but anyone can do it.

For Shuro Chi, we decided who would take this and that. I was a warlock so I did pretty much nothing but to set up well of radiance every DPS. For three players taking prisms, we would look at each other and jump at once. We did alert our clanmates about the puzzle part (can't duplicate the same plate) prior to raiding. Running into the same bug (symbol was showing three missing pieces instead of four) was quite frustrating when we were only two DPS stages away from completion. Haven't done the bounty and we don't think we can do it, we are kind of aggressive and wouldn't care about Shuro Chi's damage attacks.

For Morgeth, it was kind of complicated. We tried having one Taken strength each but we took too long so we decided having everyone take two while one had none and we finished in two phases. We would type ""S"", short for stuck or rooted.

For Vault, the mechanics were fantastic and we figured it out immediately. It was our shortest clear. Three players would call out their symbol and we had to find their symbols too. If one of their symbols is on either left (penumbra) or right (anteumbra). If the plate you are standing on has someone's symbol on the left, your plate is a penumbra. It's like a keyhole and a different key wouldn't fit. I would call, ""S ANT"", short for spire (or rock) anteumbra and if I pick up a gun that is not an anteumbra, I would stagger at a different plate with penumbra. Third and last person to pick up a gun wouldn't need to worry about which plate to stagger because there's only one plate left.

For Riven, that was a good battle. We used the same location as everyone else used (L1-L4, M1-M5 and R1-R3) but for Riven's eye location, we used numbers 1-10 instead of L1-L5 and R1-R5. It was until a clanmate suggested the cluster cheese mode, I thought normal strategy wasn't that hard. It was the ogres that we had to deal with before DPS. Cluster cheese mode was also not easy, low light players would have hard time cheesing it. It took us at least two hours to finally be able to cheese it.

For final encounter, it was about RNG on who would be chosen to carry the stone. For those in the void/dark room, we had to explain to clanmates that the first person to be teleported would fetch an orb only once until the next person to join him and then that person would fetch an orb and the person before him would get the orb last. The carrier would type ""O"", short for orb to send a signal in the dark room to grab an orb. The next person that gets teleported would have to grab it and the person before him get it, the person before him, get it and so on. However if I'm the only one in the dark room, I would count up to five by heart before grabbing an orb then carrier joins me after his time expires.

Only one of us got 1k voices, I'm so jealous of him.

Also for those wondering how my clanmate got 9 clears, he ran with his hearing friends (you might have read comments below about him) before raiding with us.

Am glad you guys are taking bullshitting bird with you!

Here we see a group of ""New"" players going through the start of the Cosmodrome.  They stumble upon a Fallen Walker blocking their path & another Fireteam fighting it as well. 

&#x200B;

At 10:15 you see another Fireteam spawn up top and come in. Level 20's, much higher than all the other guys. The main voice says ""Another Fireteam coming in! Level 20's! This is gonna be good!"" Like he's excited to see what the level 20's can pull off/do.

&#x200B;

Skip to now. If you continued the quest line that gives you the Riskrunner & Riskrunner Catalyst, you visit The Cosmodrome. You spawn up onto a set of buildings, overlooking the Fallen & a Fallen Walker.  This **very same** instance is the zone where **new players** come through.  Then you came jump down and help them fight the Fallen and the Fallen Walker before seeing them move on their own through the campaign. 

&#x200B;

If you did this quest, especially as a veteran Destiny player, **You are the level 20's coming in.** You can showcase them your immense power, what's to come, what you can do and more. You give them something to look forwards to, grind to, and become. You became legend. They will aspire to be you.   


I don't know about anyone else, but I thought **that** was really freaking awesome, it may have taken 6 years but one of the major things they showcased, **is now.**

My Clan mates bought me a new gaming pc for shadowkeep,7466,cqldi7,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/cqldi7/my_clan_mates_bought_me_a_new_gaming_pc_for/,473,1565873643.0,"So back when Destiny 1 launched, I went in essentially solo. Had no group of people to play with for real.

Slowly met my clan thru playing naturally. Met a guy, Ben, we clicked and played together. We ran our first raid together. We had a blast.

Fast forward to Kings Fall. Ben and I working our butts off to beat this raid. It was just us and lfg people. Hard to find a solid group. Lfg one day and in pop's this guy Nick. Knows what he's doing, we get a couple more random in and we clear Kingsfall. It was a very memorable experience. It was so awesome!

Us 3 raided and played trials together from then on. I found a crew. It was nice. I never had any consistent group of people to play my games with so it was nice having these guys around every time new destiny content came out.

We played and had tons of fun, and continued on into destiny 2.

We have been getting older and my responsibilities have been stacking up. I have a wedding to prepare for and I was going to save up money to buy a new gaming pc next tax season. I had it all planned out and was really motivated to work my ass off to save for a nice gaming computer once I heard about cross save functionality coming to destiny! It was a dream come true, all us boys would talk about was how awesome it would be to finally take out generation 1 guardians with us to pc. It would have been our dream come true. Our favorite game and we could take our characters that we have put so much time and effort into. So once we learned about cross save we were all ecstatic about it. That's when I knew I needed to upgrade my old laptop into something that could run destiny 2 on max settings. That was my goal.

Fast forward a bit more and my 2 buddies decided to surprise me today. Nick was acting kinda funny during the past week, asking for my shipping address and I'm just clueless to the fact that he and Ben went behind my vmback and put together a pc for me (they already have gaming rigs and it was going to be a struggle for me to gather the funds in a timely manner) So nick wanted my info and asked me if I would wait to open the mystery package till I could face time him and Ben so they could watch me open the package.

I was still clueless. I thought it may have been a new headset since mine has been causing some echo in out party chats.

Any was, the package is there, and it's big. I'm starting to really wonder what it could be. I get Ben and nick onto FaceTime and get to opening it. To my surprise it was a brand new gaming pc, built for destiny. Siva logo spray painted on the case. It was very very special and heartwarming. I have never received a gift so expensive and I was at a loss for words.

I am now ready to rock the pc community with my presence, thanks to my clan mates and good friends. They made this possible for me and I don't know what to say other than I am eternally grateful to be a part of this community that builds such amazing relationships with people I haven't even met to shake their hands.

Ben and Nick, I love you and thank you, and yall are coming to the wedding.

To the destiny community, this game has brought me so many happy memories and experiences and I just can't imagine my life without the fucking coolest video game ever made and the community that comes with it.

I just had to share my story here because it's a destiny story =)

"Bungie, it's time for you to make a statement on the XP cooldown.

Essentially, the longer you play, the less XP that you get. The game tries to obfuscate this by showing the correct XP amount even though the XP bar barely increases at all. This ""cooldown"" makes the Clarion Call a literally pointless event since you're probably only getting that bonus XP for like 20-30 minutes before the cooldown kicks in.


This is the same type of lootbox limiting system that EA was caught using in Battlefront II, and there's no reason this sub shouldn't be up in arms about it until we get an official Bungie response.


*Edit: For all of who you who are saying ""This is in no way comparable to EA"", and ""These are only cosmetics"", please remember that a large portion of the contents in Bright Engrams are items that were readily available through normal gameplay in Destiny 1. They were taken away, and now Bungie is limiting the amount we can get unless we pony up some $$$. This is not okay. This is not normal. Being apathetic to this sort of business model is exactly the reason that EA had the balls to do what they did in the first place.*",2017-11-19 13:15:27

This is beyond stupid. One, if I am solo queueing, I need to check at least one random in my fireteam to make sure I am running what they are. This sucks, especially on console where the load times for the UI have been shit since Forsaken launched. I should be focusing on running the strike, not going into my menu to inspect teammates.

Two, for some reason no one EVER runs the same subclass as the burn for the strike. Meaning if I just assume that people are running solar subclasses with solar burn, and they are both on arc, I get zero progress towards my milestone, and I have just wasted 15 minutes for nothing.

Remove this requirement Bungie, and just make the milestone ""complete 3 strikes"". It will remove this annoying headache.",2018-12-23 05:10:05

* No trials until at least after September (since its worded next few seasons) - I'd like to remind everyone this is a piece of vanilla D2 content they have taken away and not replaced.
* No faction rallies or updates about it (again, vanilla D2 content that has been taken away)
* Lack of communication, updates and SILENCE around the current state of competitive (or crucible in general)
* Lack of vendor gear refreshes that were provided to us in Year 1 (vanguard, crucible, gambit) that were stealthily removed when it all shifted to Forsaken. Again, content/expectations from Year 1 that were not communicated in year 2.
* Not having Y1 armor updated to Y2 standards, diluting the loot pool making all the gear we earned and payed for in Y1 obsolete (including eververse items)
* Less than 3 weeks away from the new season with NO details on what's changing
* Assuming the season and joker's wild are a week apart, less than 4 weeks away from the new DLC with NO details
* Crucible Labs..........what is that?
* Exotic drop rates still an issue for many
* Catalysts all but abandoned.....
* RNG titles.........
* No strike loot - the nightfall rewards are a joke compared to D1.......
* Complete regression on dev interactions from last year (Chris Barrett, Hamrick, Crucible team, etc.). Remember when we actually heard from them all ? Remember the development vids of the exotic tuning passes? Remember Hamrick saying more frequent patches/sandbox updates when actions show the direct opposite?

I love Bungie and Destiny (and I defended them throughout all of year 1), but with all the issues above, and the looming threat of being independent after the support from VV and High moon after penumbra, I have serious concerns for the future of the franchise and their ability to deliver. This drip feed method of DLC isn't working either and they have the support of two other studios!!!!!!!!!!!

You have companies like Ubisoft, Respawn and BioWare being completely open and transparent about everything on their games, including direct conversations with devs. Bungie seems to have already forgotten we enjoyed that level of interaction last winter/spring heading into Warmind. The roadmap last year included a crazy amount of QoL updates - where are those now? The roadmap this year is season content and DLC - where are the QoL updates? There is still a ton up fixing that needs to happen in D2....

Measurements don't lie. FOV and zoom are goofy in Destiny 2.,7313,a010y1,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/a010y1/measurements_dont_lie_fov_and_zoom_are_goofy_in/,292,1543114170.0,"TL;DR:

- Actual in-game viewing angle is ~4% less than FOV setting.

- Zoom is not uniform across FOVs because bungie simply divides FOV by ""zoom"" to make the ADS effect. This is never really 'ok'. It only kind of makes sense if you use a 16:9 monitor and play with a controller or always flick *all the way to the edge of your screen* to hit shots.

- ADS sensitivity is also divided by ""zoom"" - this is actually good. But since magnification (real zoom) doesn't match the sens scaling, all different zoom levels feel very different for tracking style aim. This is why snipers all feel so different.

- bungie could remove the FOV dependence from magnification by using a little bit of easy trig:

**FOVz = 2 \* ATAN( TAN(FOVh/2) / Zoom )**

OP:

I started writing this with a lot of theory and background, but it grew to several pages and ended up more like a white paper. If there is enough interest in the theory or derivations, I am happy provide that.

# FOV

I measured the 360 distance/*sensitivity circumference* in mouse counts (to ten significant figures) and worked back to find the angular travel per count or *angle increment*. At 5 sens, the circumference is 10909.09091 counts (angle increment 0.033 deg/count).

|Setting|Measurement|Percentage|Corrected|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|105|101.0|96.17|100.8|
|100|96.0|96.03|96.0|
|95|91.1|95.89|91.2|
|90|86.5|96.07|86.4|
|85|81.5|95.89|81.6|
|80|76.9|96.11|76.8|
|75|71.9|95.92|72.0|
|70|67.3|96.17|67.2|
|65|62.4|95.95|62.4|
|60|57.4|95.70|57.6|
|55|52.8|96.00|52.8|

From the numbers, we can observe that the displayed hFOV is less than the settings value by \~4%. The average measured value was 95.99% of the setting with 0.142% standard deviation.  This is not a problem by itself, but as we go deeper you can see how this can make things sticky. I also tested the FOV at 16:10 and 21:9 using custom resolutions to check the HOR+ scaling. I used a setting of 104 to obtain the following numbers:

|Setting|16:9|16:10|21:9|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|104|99.8|93.8|114.7|

These numbers confirm the equations below which convert settings to the image on your screen. From here on out, I’ll be using a setting of 104 to test the zoom and ADS sensitivity scaling. You can use these equations to check my work - or find the numbers for your setup.

FOVsetting = 104

**vFOV = 2\*ATAN( 9/16 \* TAN( (FOVsetting\*0.96)/2) )** = 67.5

**hFOV = 2\*ATAN( AR \* TAN(vFOV/2) )** = 99.8

AR is the Aspect Ratio expressed as W/H, or 16/9 = 1.778 @16:9

# Zoom

Using the same method of finding the circumference and angle increment, I tested a bunch of weapons and different scopes. These numbers came out as very nice multiples (all look like X.X0000). The measurements below assume hip hFOV of 99.8. To differentiate hip and zoomed hFOV I will call hipfire FOVh and ADS FOVz. The table below lists the measured sens circumference, and measured FOVz for each weapon/scope combo I tested. This list is not meant to be exhaustive.

There is a very clear pattern between FOV and circumference.  Both values are scaled by a parameter I will refer to as Zoom.  The Ratio entry in the table above is this zoom parameter. You probably noticed that FOVz is just FOVh divided by zoom. The sensitivity is also divided by zoom causing the circumference to grow accordingly. At first glance, this seems really great. One benefit of this scheme is that the number of mouse counts to swipe to the left or right edge of the screen is always the same – no matter the FOV. But, how often do you expect to hit full-screen swipes? One drawback to this scaling method is the reticle “feels” different for tracking (small, continuous microadjustments like you would use with 180RPM handcannons) at every FOV – including different scopes.  That’s not the end of the world, you could just get used to the different feeling for each gun you like to use.  Another problem is that this scaling between FOV and sensitivity only works as intended with an aspect ratio of 16:9 and is arbitrary at any other aspect ratio. The same scaling is applied regardless of aspect ratio setting, and we observed earlier that FOVh varies for different aspect ratios. The main problem with this scheme is that magnification varies with FOV setting. Let’s take a look at how magnification is related to FOV and the zoom parameter.

Magnification is the ratio of image size to object size. Assuming aiming from the hip to represent object size, and aiming down sights to represent image size, we can think of magnification as how the distance between points changes.  If an object on screen doubles in size, the magnification is 2.0. For simplicity, let’s look at just one row of pixels at the center of the screen.  Each pixel from center to edge can be represented as a function of the angle in 3D space between the center and the pixel of interest.  At the edge of the screen, the angle is FOVh/2.  The angle at any point between the center and the edge can be found by scaling the tangent of FOVh/2 by the distance from the center (1.0 at edge) and taking the arctangent. Since object size is proportional to the tangent of half the viewing angle, we can rearrange terms to express both the magnification as a function of FOVh and FOVz, and the desired FOVz for a given FOVh and desired magnification.

**M = TAN( FOVh/2 ) / TAN( FOVz/2 )**

**FOVz = 2 \* ATAN( 1/M \* TAN( FOVh/2 ) )**

At first I panicked that my numbers did not match [these numbers](https://www.reddit.com/r/CruciblePlaybook/comments/718fgc/detailed_zoom_testing_for_most_destiny_2_weapons/) found by u/gintellectual. Since I used a setting of 104 to take my measurements, my numbers cannot match the console values at a different FOV – magnification is dependent on FOVh.  I was able to estimate the console FOV by testing scope zooms at different base FOV settings until the magnification matched.  The console FOV is the equivalent of 73 on PC settings.  Using the above equations and zoom factors listed in the previous table, you can check for yourself:

    M = TAN( 73*0.96/2 ) / TAN( 1/Z * 73*0.96/2 )

This formula confirms the measured scaling factors on console.  The true zoom numbers are in my table, actual magnification is a function of FOV. BUT there is clearly a better way to zoom. If bungie used the magnification equations I listed above, there would be no dependency on FOV setting. Since FOVz is dependent on FOVh anyway, why use a goofy, arbitrary algebraic scaling that produces inconsistent magnification?

# Sensitivity Scaling

^(the) ^(zoom) ^(is) ^(too) ^(damn) ^(high)

Ideally, the sensitivity should scale with magnification. The image size of an object scales inversely with distance. If you start with a known size/distance then double the distance, the size appears to be half the known size. Using a 2x magnification scope would return the image size to the known hipfire size. Ok, nifty, you might be thinking. Here’s the real importance of scaling with magnification. Imagine an enemy is strafing at a particular speed and you are tracking their strafe from the hip. Now let’s apply the same process as before, double distance, double zoom. The enemy moves at the same speed near the center of the screen! The same input will track the enemy at *x* distance from the hip AND 2*x* aiming down sights!

But what happens with the system bungie is using? Let’s look back at those numbers u/gintellectual found, specifically Zoom 30 Focus. We see from my numbers that the sensitivity and FOV are modified by a “zoom” number of 7.0.  With a FOV setting of 73, this produces a magnification of 8.0. With maxed FOV the magnification is a little over 9.5.  That’s a pretty significant change in zoom, but both cases have the ADS sens scaled by 7.0. The reticle “feels” way too fast at these zooms because the scopes zoom WAY too far!

The sensitivity scaling numbers come from the weapons/scopes table. We know bungie tried to make the sensitivity match such that rotating to the edge of the screen requires the same number of mouse counts for hipfire and ADS (if you use 16:9 aspect ratio). I suspect this is a relic of the game being made for console/controller. At this point, that is not a surprise – *bungie has already fixed several bugs related to playing >30fps*. There are two ways bungie could improve the ADS sensitivity scaling, and both should be optional. I know some people are happy with the aiming system, no reason to hurt their experience.

* Option 1: Adjust ADS FOV to match the magnification

Option 1 keeps zoom sensitivity scaling independent of the user’s FOV setting (scopes don’t zoom to a fixed FOV, so there’s no real reason why magnification should vary with FOV). This would involve only adjusting the zoom function equation to:

**FOVz = 2 \* ATAN( 1/Z \* TAN( FOVh/2 ) )**

* Option 2: Adjust ADS sensitivity to match the magnification

With option 2, the ADS sens circumference is dependent on the player’s FOV setting (because magnification would still be dependent on FOV setting). This change would keep the insane zoom but scale sensitivity according to:

k = TAN( FOVh/2 ) / TAN( FOVz/2 ), which can be rearranged to

**k = TAN( FOVh/2 ) / TAN( 1/Z \* FOVh/2 )**

Both options could end up as a simple toggle in the settings. I haven’t seen bungie’s code, so I have no clue how difficult either option would be to implement. I suspect the first would be easier because it just corrects the ADS FOV to match the zoom stats, but really it’s hard to say how bungie wrote the code. My main worry is that the 4% downscale from settings will be hard for them to correct for. The algebraic method bungie uses currently does not suffer from this problem because they just scale the FOV by the zoom stat directly. But since we’re talking about representing angles from a 3d projection onto a 2d screen there absolutely is trig involved! If the 4% downscale is not accounted for, the scaling would still be arbitrary. Closer, for sure, but not correct.

My intent was to present the data first – I was very glad to confirm the measurements u/gintellectual made through a totally different method. *Science Bitch!* I also wanted to present objective case with evidence and logic for the ideal way to scale ADS sensitivity with zoom.

Can we just recognise that a large &#37; of Destiny players are solo and play just as much if not more than players who choose to put together fireteams and run raids?

No one wants fast easy progression \- and yes.. It's an issue in D2 right now. Make it harder, make it slower \- BUT make sure you make it possible for solo players. In year 1\-3, I enjoyed solo activities, the Nightfall, Crota on Hard mode \- no cheese. Iron Banner every month. Iron banner was the go to activity to get higher light gear and weapons.

That's all gone now.

Even Luke Smith recognised publicly that the majority of players don't raid or use fire teams. Guided games was a disaster. Pushing Trials and the Raid doesn't work Luke. Stop it, now before you mess up another opportunity to fix the game.

This progression update sounds like it wants to make it very difficult for solo players to hit max light. How about some more matchmaking Bungie? Of all the times to push group play \- now is not the time with the lowest ever number of players online. Or do you just want to lose some more of your player base.

And the Community Summit: No disrespect to the streamers and community legends that were invited and continue to help the game survive.. but you don't really represent the largest part of the player base either? You all Raid, do Trials.

Remember the solo player Bungie.. remember the player who cannot or won't Raid.

These players make up the largest &#37; of your players.

**Edit:** For clarity:

I never suggested that all players get all the top gear.  Certain loot should be specific to certain high end activities, just as it was in D1. What I was trying to discuss was the newest push towards Fireteam play \- at a time when there is little match\-making in the game for these activities. And you have also taken away certain existing/D1 game resources/mechanics to power up as a solo player on top of that \(IB for example\). It just seems like an illogical double punch at solo players.

It makes little sense right now to have so much content locked behind a lack of in game match\-making \- and rather than embrace the issue \- Bungie seem to be doing quite the opposite. I don't think solo players expect or want high end items to be available to all \- this was never the case in D1 either. But we do expect to be able to play content and grind towards max light without deliberate hindrance to make Raiding and Trials more attractive. It's a square peg \- round hole situation. It won't happen. We need match\-making and more solo activity structure within the games development.",2018-04-26 00:40:42

1. We spent well over a year telling Bungie that we wanted to feel powerful. Now we're bashing a top tier weapon for the sake of diversity. 

2. In a game like Destiny, there will ALWAYS be a META. Always. The game is not designed for perfect balance. Why? Because you can't have randomness in a game with perfect balance. There would be no random rolls, there would be one set archetype for every weapon, everything would be static like D2 Y1.. and even then you had a meta, because not every weapon is the same. So when you complain about not being able to use a scout rifle instead of Ikelos for boss damage, you sound like you don't understand the game you play. 

3. ""Let's buff everything to Ikelos level!"" Right. That's when you forget that Destiny is a PVP and a PVE game. 2 shot scout rifles sound fun to you? How about .4 second TTK SMGs? Yay. I understand that not everyone plays both, but Bungie has to consider both. Not only that but we had a meta that allowed this, it was D2 Y1 pre Warmind. Guess what everyone hated? D2 Y1 pre warmind. 

4. Aside from optimal boss DPS, you are free to use whatever weapon you choose for nearly any other activity in the whole game. You can even choose to run a weapon like sleeper, whisper, 1K, Thunderlord and achieve acceptable or even better boss DPS and free up your energy slot if you really, REALLY want to run Vestian Dynasty. 

5. There is no RNG lockout from the weapon. This isn't a Gjallarhorn situation. There is a clear path and hell there's even protection now that says you WILL get it eventually. So you have access to the weapon. If you're upset about LFG requiring Ikelos SG, guess what? You have an avenue to obtain the weapon. 

6. You know what? I LIKE smashing bosses into oblivion and I LIKE melting Shuro Chi's health bar the instant it comes up. Just because you want to sit there and lull yourself to sleep with a sidearm on these bosses, doesn't mean I do. GLHF, have a damn blast, knock yourself out, break a leg. Not how I want to play the game. 

End rant. 

TLDR: Ikelos SG isn't the problem, this community has a problem being happy.

Being able to dictate the gun and it’s masterwork are enough player directed assistance for me. The rolls being rng on top of that keeps it fun. 

I find it important to loot the chest multiple times at the end of a run, even with double drops at times, it’s still tough to get the perfect 5/5 roll. 

After listen to recent interviews with Luke Smith and Mark N, they said “the next season will be dictated by how much we like this season.” 

So, I want to make sure as much positive feedback get back to the community team. 

The tube grind is great, and gives us reasons to grind out playlists to get runes for the chalice.

EDIT 2: I didn’t say HOW AMAZING -
Rune Bonus 2 & 3 are!! I just got 8 snipers from one run! They really nailed the synergy with getting runes back, and the chance at double drops ACTUALLY being the gun you slotted to get, and not just a random second drop.

Entirely True Cayde Facts (F),7166,czkqf9,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/czkqf9/entirely_true_cayde_facts_f/,419,1567631778.0,"Cayde-5 was known to be a very quiet individual, and a great thinker. His file at Clovis Bray described him as ""Silent, but worth listening to when he isn't"". His previous reset was the exact opposite, described as a ""Total and complete prick"".

The Human body of Cayde was very unfit. He had difficulty walking up stairs, and according to the medical records, suffered from arthritis at a young age. He also suffered from repeated migraines, which were described as ""Like having a horn sticking out of my head"". It is thought these problems were exacerbated due to his tenure as a soldier, and the Exo program offer must have secretly been a blessing to him.

Sundance was very talkative, often whispering in Cayde's ear during important meetings. During one very tense meeting regarding Oryx, Zavala said ""We need to get ourselves deep into Oryx's Dreadnaught and destroy everything we can."" Sundance whispered ""If you know what I mean"" into Cayde's ear, who burst into laughter. 

The Ace of Spades is very, very old. Dating performed by Banshee date it as at least 300 years older than the No Land Beyond, one of the oldest known weapons. Yet is is perfectly made to fit the hand of Cayde, possibly meaning it could well have been the weapon Cayde had as a Human.

Cayde's Horn is made of a mix of Titanium, Platinum, and Iron. Ripping it from his head would have been very difficult, despite that being Cayde's biggest fear. In one particularly difficult battle against the Fallen, the rain began to pour down heavily, the storm cracking around them. Cayde leapt into the air to unleash a Golden Gun, but was struck by lightning directly onto his horn, and his Golden Gun shots fired pure arc light for a few minutes. Cayde also spoke with a stutter for a full week because of the experience.

The Guardian really was his favourite Guardian. He often talked of us in bars about how he knew us, and would embellish our victories in an increasingly grandiose fashion, from eating the Heart of the Black Garden with tenderstem broccoli to tearing Oryx's arm off and beating him to death with it. 

Cayde was a welcome sight in the City bars, as he normally had an entourage of young Hunters and curious Warlocks with him. They would drink a bar dry and move on to the next one, laughing and being a bit of a nuisance as they went.

Cayde was very close with Amanda, but not in a sexual way. He knew her since she was very young, and has kept an eye out for her ever since. He gave her her first wrench, and her first sparrow to work on. That sparrow was Cayde's personal sparrow from the moment it was completed.

Cayde at one point considered Hawthorne to be a worthy successor despite not being a Guardian. In his own words, ""She looks like a Hunter, acts like a Hunter and definitely drinks like a Hunter. Lets hope she kills me, eh? I get the feeling she could do it too, she just never quits.""

Cayde's last thoughts were of Ikora and Zavala. He desperately wished they were there with him, but knew the Guardian would bring him to them. He wished he could give Ikora a big hug one last time, and Zavala a friendly punch on the arm. 

Cayde and Sundance played pranks on Ikora for years. The exploding engram was the last straw however, and she said that if she gets pranked again, she would drag him to the Crucible. He stopped.

Cayde and Banshee were close drinking buddies. When Cayde would drink too much, he would forget what he was saying, and Banshee doesn't really need drink for that. The two of them would discuss the exact same topic for hours on end, not realising the other had just made the exact same point not moments before.

Cayde and Albios were very close, to the point where the two would actually exchange notes and scout together. It was Albios who told Cayde all he knew about the Ahamkara, and even showed one to Cayde prior to the Great Ahamkara Hunt. Cayde made a wish, but to this day the only person to hear it was Albios, who tragically passed. Albios was not a serious or solemn person, and Cayde decided to cheer up his funeral by breaking both of his own legs leaping from a mesa on Io while Banshee laughed.

Cayde and Shaxx were close, and Shaxx mourned Cayde the best way he knew how. He placed Arcite in charge of the games for a full hour, and released his pent up rage on some fallen in the cosmodrome that had remained behind. In his hour, he tore apart 7000 individual Fallen, including a particularly fearsome Captain. He raised it high above his head, and brought its back to his knee, snapping it like a twig. When he returned, he was overjoyed to see Guardians using Cayde's Hand Cannon in his Crucible. 

Cayde died doing what he loved. Having an adventure with a good friend with high stakes. He wouldn't have had it any other way.",2019-09-05 05:16:18
Crucible quickplay has lost the intent behind it,7174,cgtdvp,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/cgtdvp/crucible_quickplay_has_lost_the_intent_behind_it/,1958,1563921328.0,"I'll preface this with a little context. I'm an average to bad pvper. Been grinding for the last 3 seasons, trying to reach fabled once just to get the pinnacle weapons there. Im currently the closest I've ever been, roughly 1700. 
Planned on doing more comp today, so naturally thought I'd hop into quickplay to warm up.

What follows is a game of clash, lost 48-100, where the enemy team has 2 Not forgottens, 2 lunas howls, everyone is rolling dust rocks, and 4 of the 6 players are One eyed mask titans because of course they are.

Now, this isn't a comment or complaint on any one of those items. However, the idea that quickplay is ""casual"" whereas comp is, ya know, competitive, seems to have completely died.

I would have had a better time warming up *in* comp. Isn't that a problem? And this isn't just a one time thing, I've noticed lately QP is an constant sweatfest or pubstomp. Its no longer a place to get a few fun games in. Its where all the pvpers who ground comp for pinnacle weapons want to sit back and stomp without having to try.

Now, to be clear, I'm not hating on you PVP gods. You're good. You deserve to win when you're better. You deserve your pinnacle weapons.

But the fact that comp is so deincentivized for you has created a problem where now you are de-incentivizing crucible PERIOD for a bunch of other players. 

Because we can't learn. I can't learn what I did wrong when I take 3 steps from spawn and am immediately ganked by 3 players running NF/OEM titans who instawipe me with the super they just used a second ago to kill me before.

My opinion. One of two things needs to happen (preferably both). Comp needs an overhaul, that much is certain. How that would look is debatable, but I'd like to see some sort of cosmetic or emblem based comp end game. Not just for rank, but for time played, games won, etc... things to make serious crucible players WANTING to bounce into comp.

The other change is to quickplay. Clearly hardcore players dont want SBMM in QP (that much is clear from the outrage when Bungie did so temporarily), but for a lot of newer/learning players, that experience was a net positive for them. If not SBMM, we need some way to avoid the average joes of PvP getting crushed when they dip their toe into the crucible.

This isn't me complaining, I swear. I shrugged my shoulders at that loss, and decided I'd just go straight into comp (wish me luck!).

But it seriously worries me as to the Crucibles longevity. The balance of power has so violently shifted in pvp that most of my friends won't even touch it. I just dont want to see the player population die any more.

EDIT: Just made my way up to Fabled, yay new guns. Yeah, this post caught a lot of traction, lots of good discussion. Lets all bear in mind that players aren't the enemy here. Someone being a sweat, or god, or blueberry isn't the problem. It can be frustrating yes,  but this is an incentive problem as I see it.",2019-07-24 06:35:28

School Teacher and resident Des'plainer here...

I've had dozens of conversations with adolescents over the past four years concerning Destiny, and honestly not a SINGLE one of the kids I've talked to really cares about the story, so I daresay the target for lines like ""later haters"" and, er, *simple* storytelling is a missed one.

PvP strategies? Raid mechanics? Gun Meta? Sure. But even students of mine that are paying attention to the story notice a dramatic downturn in quality (""cringey"" was a good description I got this week).

All that said, there's no reason to even aim so low with these narratives... way back in '98 I was 10 years old picking up Metal Gear Solid for the first time and the complex, challenging story was unlike anything I had ever experienced. Kids can be challenged by a story and LOVE IT, I promise!

Garden of Salvation is finally conquered by a deaf fireteam,7104,dfkbdb,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/dfkbdb/garden_of_salvation_is_finally_conquered_by_a/,245,1570670803.0,"Proof- https://i.imgur.com/FCicJHi.jpg

It took us 35 hours, yes, ***35!***

We had to shuffle through several players trying to clear it. Such to no avail so we decided to wait till yesterday's weekly reset to push our light above 940 to attempt again and finally, we did it.

We used Zoom (video conferencing software) to communicate with each other and to discuss strategies. Chat is strictly for call-outs only. We did discuss through chat because a teammate doesn't have a secondary monitor to set up for Zoom.

For first encounter- we would split into two groups of three with one to rotate picking up the bomb each (Voltaic Overflow) and the other to clean adds/kill Angelic to set up the tether. Once the wall is disabled, we would rotate roles to allow one team's Voltaic Overflow to expire. We used overload rounds mod on our recluse.

Second encounter- At the first relay, two would stay to help tether to strengthen the Enlightened buff while four move on to the second relay. After the second relay, one would stay with three moving on to the third relay and one from the first relay would become the runner to help set up the tether at both first and second relays. The remaining three would do the same at both third and fourth relays. We would type R1, R2, R3 or R4 if we need to extend the Enlightened buff as well as ""help at R#"" after Angelic's come to say hi. We stayed at our respective relays until the final relay (in the center) is open and it was a cake. We use anti-barrier rounds for this encounter.

Third encounter- we tried the cheese and it only caused Consecrated mind to start hitting the wall. We didn't successfully get it to drop down so we dropped the cheese and did it legit. Same groups of three with one working on collecting motes for Enlightened buff and one to focus on eyes (inner/outer circles). For those working on eyes, one of us would get the Voltaic Overflow and wait for the eyes to reveal. If the red is in the inner circle, we would type I and O for outer circle. It took us two phases. No Anti-Barrier or Overload rounds were needed for this.

Final encounter- it was truly torture. This is where we spent roughly 20 hours on it. We tried so many different strategies until we finally settled on one that we would stick with it until there's a better one. Four players would split into groups of two rotate collecting motes while two stay to rebuild the grounds. We made couple of references to Portal game because two portals are colored blue (light) and orange (dark). So when we need to rebuild the ground we would say either BL (blue link) or OL (orange link). Mote collectors would start with the blue portal first until 30 motes are deposited then we move on to the orange portal for the final 30. When we shoot at knee or shoulder to activate portal, the two that aren't responsible for motes would shoot at Cyclops and once mote collectors return, they would shoot at Cyclops instead. For DPS, only four of us would set up the tether while the remaining two stay out of the picture to continue damaging boss until we reunite at the middle relay (yay for relay defender mod) after both links are successful then we do the most damage we could. It took us three phases, yep three. That's quite unfortunately. We are working on one phasing on both Consecrated Mind and Sanctified Mind. No Anti-Barrier or Overload rounds were needed for this but Anti-Barrier rounds may be needed after we spotted one inside the portal.

Overall, less call-outs is a lot better than Last Wish but new players would struggle in the final encounter. I can totally tell.

We have never cleared any raid within 24 hours for the emblem. It's how bad we want it. There are couple deaf players that defeated raids for the 24 hours emblem but there was never a complete deaf team that had done it. So we are working on the latter. We did defeat Prestige EoW on day one, yes but there wasn't any emblem for it.

P.S.: Dear Bungie, we deserve some pizza and vex milk.

This really blew up into something huh? I’m glad to see such support and I also take on that this needs to be handled the right way so it doesn’t just result in everyone getting every exotic instantly.

Also - anyone know how to tag the community dudes so someone can see this please go ahead - i’m useless at editing

Edit The Second - theres been a couple of comments about people losing out on legendary drops at max power - personally I don’t get this as you get tonnes of max power drops at max light from daily and weekly chores - but Exotic Attunement could augment Prime Attunement, meaning theres say a 30% chance (making figures up here) that your prime engram will be exotic. Once you have one that week you could lose the Exotic Attunement til the next reset.

COLLECTIONS TAB 2.0. How to solve the 'Vault Problem' with random perks (Concept),7023,bud5yq,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/bud5yq/collections_tab_20_how_to_solve_the_vault_problem/,533,1559156163.0,"# Collections Tab 2.0

Alright, so I had come up with this concept back in the fall of 2018 but had no balls to write it up here or stand up to critique. I thought maybe we will hear something alike from Bungie with time. As time went by I kinda forgot about that, but today I discovered images of the concept on my PC again and finally decided to share it with you all. Maybe you'll find it useful or at least interesting.

So here's my pitch.

**The point of the concept is to upgrade the Collections tab in a way that would make it possible to retrieve any weapon with any ALREADY DISCOVERED combination of perks.**

## Problem

There is a great number of perk combinations on any given weapon (or armor). And although you have an understanding of what combination you wanna keep, you are never really sure if you wanna keep or delete some bizarre or unusual roll. That's where your vault comes up. People who are here since Y1 of D1 know better than anyone, that the vault was never a good solution for Destiny. We have literally thousands of items and I don't even want to count how many unique rolls for every item. Clearly, it's more than 500 or any number that Bungie is willing to give to us.

**But what if I told you we are just one step away from being able to keep all our rolls without any vault?**

(yeah I'm not a great salesman, sorry)

## Solution

* When you receive any items with random rolls, the game remembers that exact combination of rolls
* In the Collections Tab, you are able to go in any weapon's 'forge' menu as if you wanted to preview it
* The forge menu allows you to see already discovered perks, and see what you've not yet discovered (image 1)
* As you select perks, the list of available perks in such combination shrinks, leaving you only with discovered combinations
* You're NOT able to just roll things, this would kill the entire chase for a godroll with any given economy, thus killing the incentive to play activities, the element of surprise, and thrill of luck
* You can not insert a perk if you've not yet discovered it in a combination with the already chosen perk
* After you choose a combination of available perks you can forge the weapon for a usual amount of materials as if you are just pulling a year 1 weapon out of the collection

## Implementation

*Please be aware that I am not near a graphic or UI designer, this is only a variation of what can be a possible solution*

**This is what I came up with**: [https://imgur.com/a/J5rbmVM](https://imgur.com/a/J5rbmVM)

&#x200B;

**Image 1:**

* This is the Forge menu of a Y2 Better Devils. Here we can float over our perk slots.
* While we float over a slot it shows you a tooltip with Discovered Perks.
* We select a slot with an 'X - Choose an insertion'.

&#x200B;

**Image 2:**

* While you are at an Insertion menu you can float over Discovered Perks
* Blurred gray ones are those not yet discovered at all
* White ones with a circle around them are available for insertion
* As it is the first perk we are choosing we have a lot of options
* We inject the Rangefinder by holding 'X'

&#x200B;

**Image 3:**

* We are selecting a second perk for our Better Devils in another Insertion tooltip at a second perk slot
* As we float over a white perk without a white round, a tip says 'Not yet discovered with RANGEFINDER'
* That means this perk was discovered, but not yet in a combination with the already selected perk, it is available in a different combination though

All of this goes for every other perk or scope slot.

## Technical difficulties

Of course, there's gotta be some difficulties.

1. The main one I think is storing the available rolls information on every gun or armor item. **There is a whopping number of 2352 combinations just for the Better Devils**. Now multiply that not only to an overall number of year 2 guns and armor in the game but also to the entire Destiny population. That is a lot.  
I am not a software engineer, but I've talked to my colleague who is and we decided that it would be optimal to store a list of pairs of linked nodes for each graph serverside on each weapon obtained by user (where each graph is a unique combination of perks for that weapon), and then calculate available combinations on a client.   
**We DO NOT store** shaders, trackers, masterworks or any other additional characteristics of an item.  
All this may not be a simple task but then again this is a major game problem we are talking about, I think it's worth the effort.
2. Then there are masterworks. I gotta be honest, I didn't think about them a lot, but I guess we should not store info on them with perks combinations. Maybe we can add some fun by adding a second 'forge' button, that would roll a random masterwork at the moment of forging. This should demand a number of needed resources.

## Conclusion

I hope someone at Bungie will notice that we want this game to be better and we are not always toxic redditors blaming them for 'laziness', we can provide things such as this post.

Maybe some parts of this concept are going to find their way into the game, I hope we can at least consider such solutions and talk about them.And sorry for my English, it's not my first language.

# TL;DR

We could upgrade the Collections tab in a way that would make it possible to retrieve any weapon with any ALREADY DISCOVERED combination of perks, and by doing this we will get rid of a conception of the vault altogether, making it just a little box for a small number of things we are actually using day-to-day. We will not be afraid of deleting ANYTHING, because we know we can retrieve it after we discovered it anytime.

The only reason people did EP was for the weapons. Currently there's no point in doing blind well outside the bounties and the first seed of light.

EP was a success because of the loot to chase, the game needs more stuff to grind like that. Make a good secondary so I can take my EP shotty off.

(ignore this if a new tier blind well comes this reset or in future with the dreaming city and actually drops stuff lol)

This is also assuming there isn’t another activity still to come that drops some good stuff and this was designed to be mainly for the bounty

Good loot to chase is one of the primary factors that makes an activity worth playing. Blind well is a cool and fun activity it’s just missing unique gear. Hearing that EP had unique rewards was a pretty cool touch imo that made the activity successful. Without the loot it would have been dead on arrival, a bit like when the raid lairs were first released. You do them once and you’ve experienced the whole thing, there were no unique items worth chasing outside of the power increase. 

Edit: I know t4 drops powerful gear on first run. It’s just that there’s no reason to continue to do blind well after the 5 or so runs needed for the bounty and going after your first seed. A few Blind Well weapons or armour pieces (with cool perks) would be a nice addition to chase for a long term goal and long term replay-ability, because it will be pointless at 600 power.",2018-09-26 06:44:25

Divine Fragmentation Quest FOUND!!!,6972,ddvbal,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/ddvbal/divine_fragmentation_quest_found/,725,1570347504.0,"If you go to the Garden of Salvation gate entrance in patrol, you encounter some vex coming out of it. Killing them spawns a big boss, who gives you a exotic quest called Divine Fragmentation.

If says we have to find a vex construct that is NOT on the moon. Any ideas as to where this is?

Edit: To get to the gate, head to the Lunar Battlegrounds on the moon, once you get to the area with the broken bridge (Where you capture the 6 hive things in the opening mission), turn left and go down the big path. You can't miss it. Keep going till you reach the gate, kill the vex and the boss to get the quest

&#x200B;

Edit  2: So for the first step you need to go to 3 lost sectors, analyze the  cores, and kill the vex. The first one is in the cistern, in the Conflux  on Nessus. It's up on the right side of the room about halfway through.

The second one is in the Orrey lost sector. In Artifacts Edge on Nessus. It's halfway through the lost sector to the left. Before you reach the stairs.

Third one is in Ancients Haunt on Nessus. Halfway through the lost sector there is a small room to the left. Inside is the oracle.

\-Next Step is to kill 120 Vex in the Black garden or the vex by the gate where you originally got this quest. 

\-Third Step is to go to the lectern on the moon and buy the exotic item there. Credit to r/[jakelikesjellybeans](https://www.reddit.com/user/jakelikesjellybeans).

\-Final Step is to put it in the secret raid room at the beginning of the raid. It seems you have to tether two rooms that appear on the left and right after that.

Edit 3: So you have to tether the rooms on the left and right in the beginning of the raid. ( Right before the first boss room.) Someone also said that they found more rooms with tethers after the first encounter.

This is probably similar to the monitors in WoTM in D1. So far it seems like you have to do a tether room after each encounter in the raid. If anyone proves otherwise I will edit it below.

Frankly, it's disgusting behavior, especially if the people posting these things don't actually work for Bungie/Activision.

This game is **designed for grinding and replayability**. I'm super happy for your sister's friend who only plays 30 minutes a week and has plenty of content to do, but there are many of us who have reached the end of meaningful replayable endgame content. 

I am there myself, and I didn't even ""no-life"" it. I have a full time job and a girlfriend who I spend time with. But that doesn't matter. The lack of end game content isn't affected by the amount of hours spent playing.

**We should have replayable end game content appropriate for a power level bungie expected many of us to be by now (260+)**

I want to clarify that when I say replayable end game content, **I don't mean the content you can only replay once a week. I'm not talking about the raid or the nightfall.**

Now back to how the amount of hours doesn't matter. Open your director. Find me the highest recommended Power Level activity. It's probably less than 260, and it's probably not substantial. **That alone is enough to show we are lacking meaningful replayable end game content.** It doesn't matter if you've played 1 hours or 2000 hours.

These Bungie loyalists literally are asking you to artificial pad the game by time gating yourself. It's crazy. 

They even say idiotic things like, ""It's only week 2!!"" or ""Remember vanilla Destiny?"" 

These are bullshit arguments. It's not week two. It's 3 years and 2 weeks, or week 156. The comparison to vanilla Destiny is kind of funny considering these same criticisms exist for that too. So essentially people are saying, ""It's okay. Vanilla Destiny was just as lacking!""

The thing is, a lot of these things were fixed at the end of D1, and are inexplicably missing from D2. 

Here is a better quote from another user:

>""It's the second week."" I'm sorry but this is horseshit and it's starting to bother me. This is not the second week, the second week was 3 years ago and had Guardian's telling each other that the Gjallarhorn was a waste of coins. Look at where Destiny began, to where it ended, to where we are now. I don't understand why Destiny 2 had to take steps backwards in so many places. It feels like we reset back to beginning of Destiny 1, which I thought we all agreed was objectively worse than the end of Destiny 1.

Here is a compilation of things I've posted about and have found from other people:


- Removed Strike and Crucible Streak rewards; tied Fireteam Medallions to Bright Engrams.

- armor no longer has perks or int/dis/str rolls, killing variety. (Although this could be a good thing if you just want to wear what looks nice)

- Lost sectors, chests in the wild, scavenger chests, and public events all have basically the same loot.

- Removed selectable perks on (almost) all Exotic equipment, killing variety. 

- Improved Emblems, removed more emblems than they added, made emblems non-purchasable with Glimmer. 

- Removed more armor perks than they added as mods. Removed more weapon perks than they added.

- Removed more subclass perks than were added (I counted and there are less than 6 new abilities across all subclasses, not including class abilities - otherwise literally copy/paste). 

- Removed strike specific loot. 

- Removed daily heroic story missions; added 3 weekly heroic story missions. 

- Removed strike points system. 

- Removed subclass customization (went from 7 total player options to 4 - almost half). 

- Added Exotic Sparrows; removed Sparrow Collection, Sparrow Horns, Sparrow types, tied Sparrows to Bright Engrams. 

- Improved Shader system; removed Shader collection, made Shader system punishing to use, tied shaders to Bright Engrams. 

- No new race or anything character related. 

- Nearly all enemies are recycled.

- Uninspired new classes with only two paths.

- little to no replayable end game content. 

- a severe lack of variation in the armor department. 

- None of the armor does anything special at all. 

- 90% of the exotic perks are laughably bad. 

- half assed vault with no categories. 

- a fucking farming timer that gives you empty chests if you're farming too much. 

- not a single new grenade. 

- 2/3 subclasses are recycled. 

- recycled exotics. 


Edit: This is a compilation of things from myself and others users here. There may be some duplicates. I don't care about the size of the list. 

Some things on the list are small, but plenty of them are considerable.

There was no reason to take so many steps backward from the end of D1 into D2. I say no reason, but I think most of us know the reason. It's so they can trickle it out to us and/or make us pay for it via DLC.

But more than anything, my concern is the people in this community telling other people their opinions aren't valid because they play too much. That is ridiculous. 

I also want to say that **I am NOT a Destiny hater. I love Destiny and I still play it every day because it's a ton of fun.** But I'm not going to bury my head in the sand and pretend there aren't glaring issues.

apparent revelation that the new armor for the raid in Shadowkeep—set in the D1
location of the Black Garden on Mars, a Vex domain—will be a reskin of the Curse of
Osiris Eververse armor, the Omega Mechanos set (this was just confirmed in the latest [TWaB](https://old.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/d07vph/this_week_at_bungie_952019/)).

Fortunately, this is not another post about that. This post is more an examination of the overall trend of Eververse-obtained cosmetic items, and the apparent willingness Bungie has as a company to forgo lore-supported acquisition of a select number of cosmetics, instead putting all the 'cool stuff' behind Bright Engrams. 

Now, of course, since this is discussing cosmetic items that (by and large) do not affect gameplay, many of the opinions to the effect of, 'why does Tess have all the cool shit??' are entirely subjective. What I'm more seeking to do here is to discuss items that seem like they could have been placed as rewards for certain activities that would be lore-friendly and positively reinforcing for the player. 

I'm going to wait until the end to discuss Weapon ornaments and Armor, since it would just add about 150 words to each section to the effect of, 'why is this stuff so much nicer than earn-able armor sets?', and 'why can't I earn this through ... using the gun or something?'

Since there are 100s of Eververse items, I'm not going to touch on all of them. But I would like to take a few select examples across all of the seasons and discuss why their placement in Eververse feels bad, and how a more conscientious distribution of cosmetic rewards for activities could lead to greater player engagement and satisfaction. I'll also take a bit of time to point out good examples when they come up, as rewards that I'd like to see elaborated on going forward.

##Season 1 — Destiny 2 Vanilla, ""Is this the only flavor?""

The honeymoon phase, before people really saw how problematic this game was on launch. The only one that really jumps out to me here is [*Rose and Bone*](https://i.imgur.com/zs9vBWx.jpg), supposedly Rezzyl Azir's ship before he became Dredgen Yor. It does start off a recurring theme here, though: ships that were puzzlingly released through Eververse before relevant content came up—in this case, the Thorn quest. Now, it's entirely possible that perhaps they didn't know that Thorn was coming back at this point, but our first iteration of this question: wouldn't this have been a fantastic cosmetic reward for completing the Thorn quest, or perhaps the triumph for Thorn? Perfect fit that shows the effort you put into doing it. 

We find here the first of the shader objections, too: why are the 'class shaders'—*Frumious Blue*, *Noble Constant Red*, and *Midnight Talons*—locked behind Tess? Wouldn't it have made slightly more sense to give those to their respective Vanguard Commanders? Wouldn't it be nice if Hunters *had* a Vanguard Commander?

Coming hot off the revelation of XP throttling roughly two weeks before release of CoO, comments of 'dEAd gAmE LeL' continued to plague every place that wasn't here—and here with constant spamming of #2tokensandablue (still pretty funny, sorry DeeJ). This was not helped by what seemed a renewed focus on Eververse, with some pretty awesome stuff being locked behind Ms. 'Needless to Say'. Some things that really stick out to me:

A whole host of exotic ships that would be better suited elsewhere: [*Ikora's Resolve*](https://i.imgur.com/R3RAfXi.jpg), [*Asher Mir's One-Way Ticket*](https://i.imgur.com/JUTdIiA.jpg), [*Kabr's Glass Aegis*](https://i.imgur.com/ExLOtxR.jpg), [*Sails of Osiris*](https://i.imgur.com/iXNa9WG.jpg), [*Saint-14's Gray Pigeon*](https://i.imgur.com/D4bd5BW.jpg) ... the reason these all make me go '?' is that it would be so easy to make them a reward for doing something meaningful in the game, rather than farming PEs.   

- *Ikora's Resolve* could have been a random drop from her token engrams (yeah, remember when she was relevant, lol?), maybe in some way making it meaningful the work you do for her. Also of note is that this was at the time the only *Arcadia*-class dropship in-game, i.e., the only ship of the same frame as the original ship you first acquire in *Destiny*, which would be exciting and nostalgic for long-time players.    
- *Asher Mir's One-Way Ticket*—I don't know, Pyramidion Nightfall rare drop (speaking of Nightfall drops, I'll touch on those momentarily)? A side note about this is that honestly if they had just dropped it to legendary and called it something else, practically no one could tell the difference.
- *Kabr's Glass Aegis*—what? Why is this—how did—I can think of no earthly reason why Fenchurch's or Tess' grabby little paws could get this. While I can't really think of a super relevant place to put this (again, the only tenuous connection this game has to the Vault of Glass is the Pyramidion, and we can't stuff all the rewards in there, even if it *is* one of the best strikes in the franchise, don't @ me), but it certainly makes no sense whatsoever that it's in Eververse.  
- *Sails of Osiris*: c'mon, this one is ridiculous. Just give it to us at the end of the campaign, or as a reward for one of the strikes, or Heroic adventures on Mercury ... there's just so many Osiris-related reward sources that this would have made so much more sense for this to have come through, it's frustrating to see it dropped into Eververse. See also the [*Curse of Foresight*](https://i.imgur.com/Azj6kRb.jpg), the Osirian-themed Sparrow—give it to us as a reward for *Tree of Probabilities*, since that's the only time we can use Sparrows on Mercury, hahah.  
- *Saint-14's Grey Pigeon*: again, this just seems obvious. Kick Perfect Paradox to the end of the Prophecy weapons, and have this as a reward for finding S14's tomb. So perfect, memorializing S-14, and your commitment to the quite lengthy grind that is the Forge weapons.

Vex Shaders: *Mercury Vex Chrome*, *Descendant Vex Chrome*, and *Precursor Vex Chrome*. While my relation to Eververse and shaders has never been good, these ones in particular kinda got me: why is it, that when we have a bunch of missions that go forward and backward in time, and are all set on Mercury, and involve all three of the Present, Descendant, and Precursor Vex, are their respective shaders given to Tess? It just seems so mind-blowingly obvious to have these as rewards for finishing a quest or adventure in the past/present/future Mercury that it really just ... c'mon, man. 

And while this is personal opinion, of course, the aforementioned Omega Mechanos gear looks way better than the Mercury armor offered by Brother Vance, FWIW—more on the armor issue later.

However, CoO did admittedly see the introduction of Nightfall-exclusive drops, which, as I said, were definitely a good thing. To their credit, there are some cosmetic examples in the collection that I still use—like [*Universal Wavefunction*](https://i.imgur.com/pWzeQGE.jpg) on my main, to this day. And again to their credit, the models used for all of the Nightfall-exclusive drops are unique to those drops and have not been used since. Hell, if you really want to, you can still use the weapons, even if they're now out-classed by Y2 options. That's pretty all right by me—these were a step in the right direction, with a clear 'do *x* activity, get *y* reward'. The fact that they were pretty 'neat!' rewards was icing on the cake.

##Season 3 — ""Warmind if I play through?""

Not without its problems, but the first point at which there were some mutterings of, 'well, maybe Bungie might be able to right this ship ...', but also came with its own host of '... why is this *here*?'

Chief among them for me would be the swapping of [*Vespulsar*](https://i.imgur.com/9Zmr1bE.jpg), an exotic Sparrow with a Rasputin-effect contrail, and a generic legendary sparrow, [*Pacific Deception*](https://i.imgur.com/nUyXNu1.jpg). *Pacific Deception*, while a perfectly nice sparrow, I guess, has no connection whatsoever to Escalation Protocol (where it drops from), aside from its default shader being a Rasputin shader. Moreover, its model mirrors others in Tess' loot pool, leading me to believe that *Vespulsar* was originally slated as the random drop from EP, and was swapped by higher, meddling powers. 

Another fun first is that of the first Silver-exclusive ornament, the totally-cool [*Lupus Visage*](https://i.imgur.com/mXJB6MS.jpg) ornament for the Fighting Lion. It goes without saying that I am less-than-thrilled with ornaments—especially themed to an event, like Iron Banner—that are only obtainable with real-world money. Why was this not a reward for 'do *x*, *y*, and *z* in Iron Banner, and turn in *q* packages'? There's way to make this *explicitly-Iron-Banner-themed* reward related to stuff we do in Iron Banner, rather than stuff we *pay* for in Eververse. It's also worth noting—to my great disappointment, as I'm currently grinding the Mountaintop quest—that this ornament remains indefinitely unavailable if you didn't buy it in Season 3. This will not be the first time we see stuff like this—and this is only the beginning. 

However, there was also a high point, as well: the ship tied to the Whisper Quest (and, for the record, the Whisper Quest is still a highlight of D2), [*A Thousand Wings*](https://i.imgur.com/HThbO8W.jpg) (itself a Taken-ified version of the [*Agonarch Karve*](https://i.imgur.com/N6tdAI8.png) from D1), is actually related to a three-week puzzle from the Heroic version of the mission, which is a great and fitting reward for putting that time in.  

However, this also marked the first time we saw event-related, silver-exclusive ornaments: [*Bound Hammer*](https://i.imgur.com/GDenOlq.jpg) and [*Between Breaths*](https://i.imgur.com/EsPrNaP.jpg). While there was some trepidation from the community that they were only available through Silver, it has since been confirmed by Bungie that the revenue from these was used to make similar content, like the Thunderlord quest, and the Zero Hour mission after it.
____
##Season 4 — #4saken

Eververse, at least for the first bit of Forsaken, was not that bad. Many of the rewards were at least not obviously related to an activity that we did in-game, so it more felt like, 'oh, that's a shame', rather than 'hey, wait, shouldn't that be a reward for doing x?'

That being said, there are a few examples I feel like are worth mentioning: 

The [*Tyrant Shell*](https://i.imgur.com/AfxwnIb.jpg) feels like it could have been tied to something Rasputin-y (maybe acquiring all of the Resonant Frequencies on Mars?).   
I'm not 100% sure about this, but I'm fairly confident that [*Unfinal Shapes*](https://i.imgur.com/rJ7Lh9R.jpg) is the first direct reference to Eris Morn in D2 outside of the lore books—that is to say, the first reference to a noticeably-absent D1 character that most people would see. This one is kiiiiinda /shrug-y, because where would this get put otherwise (Titan maybe?), but ...  
[*Ravager's Ride*](https://i.imgur.com/NCCVRwm.jpg) seems like an obvious fit for the Heroic version of *The Rider* mission, perhaps as a random drop. Or maybe from one of Spider's Heroic bounties. It seems like it could be better suited as a not-Bright Engram thing.

**Sidebar — Spookytiem**

Largely okay since most of the drops were pretty explicitly spooky-themed (and therefore not really related to anything else in Destiny), though [*Stonecraft's Amalgam Shell*](https://i.imgur.com/J0iO7sV.jpg) would have been a great fit for defeating the resurrecting jackass Nightfall.  
This is the second time we saw silver-exclusive ornaments as well, this time for the Thunderlord: [*Hypervelocity*](https://i.imgur.com/rZdl6pm.jpg) and [*Tlāloc's Wrath*](https://i.imgur.com/td9j1AO.jpg). As with the ornaments for Whisper, I'm more okay with this, as we've since had confirmation that purchases of them directly fueled similar content, which has been awesome.
___
##Season 5 — ""Well, *I* don't see what's wrong with a 'White Armory'.""

Mezzo-mezzo on this one here. While many of the drops should have been elsewhere than Eververse, there weren't that many drops to begin with. But:

All of the ships in Eververse. While that may sound a bit much, there were only three, and they all have a clear place they 'should' be, so to speak.  
[*Ódrerir*](https://i.imgur.com/GKLBGC1.jpg): random drop from Volundr forge in the EDZ, or as a reward for finishing the 'Master Blaster' achievement (kill 500 enemies with Jötunn during a Volundr Forge activation). It's not a super flashy ship, so I'm not torqued about it, but by the same rationale it could be a nice little bonus.   
[*Ada-1's Lone Wolf*](https://i.imgur.com/VHVbHQ8.jpg): Reward for the Blacksmith title. EZ-PZ. That title is nothing to shake a stick at, so this would be an awesome reward for those who have it.  
[*unsecured/OUTCRY*](https://i.imgur.com/js1pWbT.jpg): again, this feels like an obvious choice for a Rasputin-y themed thing. Again with the ship that drops from various chests (nodes perhaps? I've heard conflicting reports) on Mars—the [*Alpha Umi*](https://i.imgur.com/O4Ags1r.jpg)—it's a perfectly nice ship, but it's unclear how it's related at all to Mars or Rasputin. As was the case with *Pacific Deception*, it really does seem like this was swapped in at some point with no regard to its relation to its setting or drop scenario. Perhaps this should come from a Mars-related triumph, or its Heroic adventures?

Another good point I wanted to highlight was the [*Platinum Starling*](https://i.imgur.com/xPKKTMw.jpg), the reward for forging 100 (!) weapons in the forges. I think that's a great reward for that effort—and maybe I'll even be able to get it soon!

We also had another Iron Banner silver exclusive, this time in the form of Ghost projections, which, while not as bad as the Fighting Lion ornament or the emote, are ill-suited to being only available through monetary purchase.

Overall, 

>not great, not terrible. 

Probably more bad than good, but this is MTX and monetization we're talking about, so we'll take what we can get. 
___
##Season 6 — Drifty Boi Reconnects With an Old Flam(ing Coin)

Our last 'normal' season, it was interesting for a few reasons in terms of Eververse—not in the least that an enormous amount of ornaments were dumped in Tess' inventory. While there's a whole section on ornaments below, I wanted to draw attention to four in particular: 

- *Powerful Statement* for the Loaded Question. As with LQ's other ornament, it is incredibly lackluster, in much the same way that Merciless' white ornament is.  
- *87% Ennui* for the 21% Delirium (what happened to the overlapping 6%?).  
- *Perfluorocarbon* for the Oxygen SR3 (two snide comments here: 'I sincerely wish it made the gun perform better', and, 'about as interesting as the gun itself').  
- And the *Itsy-Bitsy Spider* for the Recluse (again, doesn't do a whole lot visually. Gun is still OP though).

Why these four? Because these three weapons are quest weapons, and I don't love that the 'upgraded version' (scare quotes are there for a reason, but often ornaments improve a gun—see 'Vigil for Saint-14', below) is only available through Tess. Couldn't these be a reward for demonstrating your mastery of the weapon, in much that the quest itself demonstrates that—like, for instance, how the ornament for Redrix' Claymore that could only be acquired through hitting Legend in the comp playlist?

Also of note a cool Ghost shell that felt like it should have been elsewhere, namely:  
[*The Hissing Silence*](https://i.imgur.com/YLEdHd4.jpg) Shell. You know what the silence is hissing? That this so obviously should have been a random drop from Tier 3 Reckoning, or from Bounties of the IX. C'mon! There's a whole boatload of IX-related stuff this season! It didn't occur to anyone that this could've been a great addition to their loot pools? 

I'd also like to take a moment to mention the *Vigil for Saint-14* ornament for Vigilance Wing, purely because it's an ornament that comes about as close to improving the functionality of a weapon as any ornament does. That's a slippery slope, unfortunately. But also, again, what if they had re-released the mission to everyone, and had this be a tie-in drop? How killer would that be? It might even rehabilitate CoO's reputation a bit!

Third iteration of silver-exclusive ornaments, this time for Outbreak Prime and its mission. /shrug, see reasoning above. 
___
##Season 7 — ""♫ Completely-Ammoral-Lying-Unhinged-Superego ♪♫—wait, I thought we were doing *Mary Poppins*?""

This, of course, is where everything gets a bit wonky. The usual thought process of 'hey, could this be somewhere else?' is magnified by a few factors: first, the new items with the new season are now no longer available through a seasonal engram (which is to say, only acquirable through using bright dust or silver—yikes). Secondly, the designs depart in a significant way that many previous designs don't—a majority of the designs in Season of the Opulence Eververse, from ships to sparrows to shells, are entirely unique, making them more desirable. This was not a mistake. And if anything, that makes it worse! Purposely exploiting FOMO to maximize profits—not everyone has two years' worth of Bright Dust stored up, and what's the only way to get more bright dust fast ... ?—seems at best morally gray, and at worst deliberately conniving. Thirdly, there are some items that will not be available for Bright Dust this season (though they will appear in future seasons), meaning that some things will not be earnable this season, a change from the previous six seasons.   
This is slightly offset by the fact that frankly, even though many of the new designs are cool, none of them are super related to anything. There's no clear-cut example of 'hey, shouldn't these be related to *x* activity?' The only one I can think of is the flavored shells should be tied to mastery of their respective elements (for instance, every subclass-related achievement across all three characters, or some sufficiently high bar like that), but even that is kinda stretching it. So it's kinda nice that even if all of the S7 is unique and un-acquirable except through Bright Dust and Silver, they're at least not themed beyond 'set in the Destiny universe'. 
___
##Ornamental Offerings

This is a bit of an odd area. Ornaments have never really been something you can earn in Destiny—even in D1, ornaments were exclusively Tess' domain. So to object to them being Tess' inventory seems a bit ... disingenuous. But!—this ties back to my earlier point that perhaps ornaments should be tied to mastery of the weapon. I know that Call of Duty isn't exactly a *persona grata* in the gaming crowd, but the whole idea that the 'top tier' skins of the weapons could be acquired by playing a crazy amount with it is a good one—what better to demonstrate your expertise with a weapon than 1,000 masterworked PvP kills (for the record, I have just *three* weapons like this in 1500h playtime) or 10,000 MW'd PvE kills?  
That being said, if we don't leave ornaments for Tess, what will she have? I don't have a lot of sympathy for her, but I do have sympathy for extra content like the Whisper Mission and Zero Hour. 

Perhaps a season's ornaments should be released for Bright Dust on a two seasons' delay? Fr'instance, the Reckoning weapons ornaments (which make the weapons look *amazing*) haven't been offered past the Drifty season. Given the new, exciting drop rates for Reckoning weapons, it would be great to have that work of the weapon artists back in play. 
___
##Armor—not just for arms!

This is a current flashpoint, but there has been a undercurrent of, 'hey, wait, why does this stuff look so much better than ... all of the other stuff?' Specifically, it smarts when you see the armor for Crucible and Vanguard and Gambit etc. stagnate for several seasons on end (there has not been a vendor refresh since Forsaken, including even light refreshers like the ornaments found in previous seasons). So why is Eververse getting these shiny new armor sets—and often ones that have pretty hefty lore connections, such as Wei Ning's armor, or Andal Brasks' armor—that are not only locked behind Eververse, but are also impossible to grind in the same way as Vanguard and Crucible armor. This feels shitty.  
Moreover, to speak to the recent controversy, when old Eververse armor is used for a pinnacle activity, it kinda feels like Bungie is laying their priorities bare—and that *earning* cool gear through tough activities is less of a priority for them than buying cool gear through Eververse.
___
##I like big rebuttals and I cannot lie—though honestly this one is pretty small

This post would seem at best ignorant if I didn't mention *why* Eververse exists, and why so many of these things are currently behind Tess. 
Eververse, of course, exists to make money. We have no idea *how* much money it makes Bungie, but we can guess from the fact that every season, there's been a new slew of items and a full, unique armor set, that it makes enough money for them to devote that kinda resources to it. So it's not insignificant.  
So that is a consideration for any argument like the one I'm making: at some point, Tess needs to make money. What better way to do that than with cool, exclusive shit?
___
##Vanguard's Dare: Not change armor for three seasons (*Achievement Unlocked!*)

That being said, it does feel frustrating to see so much cool shit locked behind Tess—and at some point, it often feels as if Bungie is—explicitly or not—encouraging us to spend money to get cool stuff, rather than play their fantastic content to do it. I believe that all legendary drops being 2.0 at Shadowkeep will alleviate this *somewhat*, but it's certainly a bit eyebrow-raising to see Tess 'find' new armor every season, when the Vanguard has has a mediocre reskin set for three seasons straight. 
And don't get me wrong, I actually kinda like some of the reskins we've seen from D1—but again, Tess hasn't got any reskins. It would be nice to see a different prioritization.

And another benefit of placing all of these exotics etc. in the places I""ve recommended is that it keeps old content relevant. Look at the chase for [*Nanophoenix*](https://i.imgur.com/0J5jn9I.jpg), the ship from the Wrath of Machine Heroic version: people ran that raid ad nauseum just for the ship. Now, perhaps the drop rates shouldn't be *that* low (the running theory is that Nanophoenix dropped at a 1-2% rate, with no bad luck protection), but having a chase for cool, prestige cosmetics could maintain player engagement with a lot of content, and make sure that that content doesn't fall out of relevance. Win-win-win. 

In sum, a more conscentious distribution of cool-ass cosmetics would be a fantastic way to keep content relevant, keep player engagement up, and reward players with a sense of satisfaction and prestige. While I understand that Tess needs to make money, it seems clear to me that some things that could be redistributed, *especially* those that have lore relevance. It would be doing the assets and the players justice.

Nothing else has been talked about more but still had little to nothing fixed. I believe there was an “attempt” at a fix? Some changes to matchmaking that ultimately did nothing.


This isn’t about reinventing the wheel. This is about listening to the community and taking note of the successes of other competitive games and the ways they utilize skill based matchmaking.


Right now on the daily there are post of people being thrown into half filled games. Not games people quit and you fill in. **Brand new matches that start with several empty slots.

That way we can go back to talking about Nova-warp, HunterMasterRace, or whatever.

>How can my second, third, and tenth Better Devils hand cannon be interesting? That's a question we should be asking and answering as quickly as we can,"" -Luke Smith

Without that fundamental question answered, this game is still going to feel like shit to play. We're going to get flooded with blue and purple loot that is well below our current light level. We're going to fill up our mailbox with it. We're going to shift our inventory around to make room to remove it from the mailbox. Then we're going to dismantle it immediately, into weapon parts to use at the gunsmith... TO GET THE EXACT SAME GUNS.

The fundamental problem with Destiny is simple: the prizes suck. The loot is shit in every aspect of this game, and there is absolute no chase to be had. Nothing to desire.

The static affixes on the guns: suck. I can't tell you what any of them are, they're so bad and unimpactful. I can't honestly tell you I feel ANY difference between Uriel's Gift and Positive Outlook. Are they really that different? They feel pretty much the same. Shrug. Who gives a shit. Neither one of them makes me go ""hell yeah!""

The grinding for the CoO vex guns was cool, but guess what?! They all suck, too! No idea what special perk any of those have either! They look cool, but they feel like the exact same gun as the others.

Theres a fast, medium, and slow version of each gun type. That's all I know. That's all I've bothered registering because the affixes feel SOOOOOOO boring.

Nothing yesterday addressed any of this. Mods 2.0 *might*, but what I learned from the post is YOU STILL HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO IMPLEMENT MODS. You actually thought that the current mod system was good, and had no plans to improve it until the community revolted on this game.

You've made a game with zero aspiration. Nothing to strive for. Nothing yesterday changes that. Diablo 3 refound it's footing when it starting making you powerful. When it realized that players want their avatars to be empowered characters. Big numbers. Gear synergy. Diverse gameplay styles from the gear. NOTHING in Destiny 2 comes close to that. It's all primary fire and rockets. It's lame. It's frustrating. And the game is going to die because of it.

Nope! Better throw money at the screen to get them from Eververse. Want a weapon that only has a 5% chance of dropping from one strike? Nah. Nothing like that here, better go back and grind for Grasp of Malok some more. Maybe the monthly Iron Banner will have some unique weapons? Nope, reskins of weapons that already existed. Even if you want the unique armor, there's little to no chance you'll get the full set if you have a job, family, or school. Destiny going in the direction of a collection game is fine. But if you're going to call it that now, at least give us something meaningful or unique to try to collect.

The franchise advertised itself witht he slogan ""Become Legend"", I wont be a legend in D2 if my character hasnt beaten Atheon, killed the sword baby, prevented HoW from gaining strenght by using Vex time travel technology, defeated the source of the Hive, Oryx, the Light Eater and prevented a self replicating virus spreading again.

edit 3: Tess' voiceover cost too much silver,  
but u/StorytimeGhost gave an [audio version](https://soundcloud.com/chrisallenvoice/how-the-eververse-stole-christmas) for us to devour  

&nbsp;

Every guardian in the tower liked The Dawning a lot...  
But the Tess, who lived central Tower, did NOT!  

&nbsp;

Everis hated the Dawning! The whole Dawning season!  
Now, please don't ask why. No one quite knows the reason.  

&nbsp;

It could be her hair was not cut just right.  
It could be, perhaps, that her skin was too light.  

&nbsp;

But I think that the most likely reason of all,  
May have been that her purse was two sizes too small.  

&nbsp;

Whatever the reason scheming under that awning,  
She stood there on Dawning Eve, hating The Dawning,  

&nbsp;

Staring from her storefront with a sour, awoken frown,  
At the transmatted guardians right in their town.  

&nbsp;

For she knew every guardian down Tower across,  
Were busy now sorting their vault for a toss.  

&nbsp;

""And they're throwing snowballs!"" she snarled with a sneer,  
""Tomorrow is The Dawning! It's practically here!""  

&nbsp;

Then she growled, blue fingers nervously drumming,  
""I MUST find some way to stop The Dawning from coming!""  

&nbsp;

For Tomorrow, she knew, all the guardian girls and boys,  
Would wake bright and early. They'd rush for their toys!  

&nbsp;

And then! Oh, the loot! Oh, the loot!  
Loot! Loot! Loot!  
That's one thing she hated! The LOOT!  
LOOT! LOOT! LOOT!  

&nbsp;

Then the Voidwalkers, young and old, would mayhem their novas.  
And they'd nova! And they'd nova! And they'd NOVA!  
NOVA! NOVA! NOVA!  

&nbsp;

They would novabomb all day, until the loot is released.  
Which was something Tess Everis couldn't stand in the least!  

&nbsp;

And THEN They'd do something she liked least of all!  
Every guardian in town, the tall and the small,  

&nbsp;

Would stand close together, with Dawning bells ringing.  
They'd stand hand-in-hand. And start dancing and singing!  

&nbsp;

They'd dance! And they'd dance! And they'd DANCE!  
DANCE! DANCE! DANCE!  

&nbsp;

And the more the Everis thought of un-dust paid dancing,  
The more that she thought, ""I must stop this whole thing!""  

&nbsp;

""Why, for fifty-three years I've put up with it now!""  
""I MUST stop this Dawning from coming! But HOW?""  

&nbsp;

Then she got an idea! An awful idea!&nbsp;  
THE TESS GOT A WONDERFUL, AWFUL IDEA!  

&nbsp;

""I know just what to do!"" The Tess laughed in her throat.  
And she made Eververse and stocked it with bloat.  

&nbsp;

And she chuckled, and clucked, ""What a great Tessy trick!""  
""With this Eververse loot, I look just like Saint Nick!""  

&nbsp;

""All I need is good loot..."" The Tess looked around.  
But, since good loot is scarce, there was none to be found.  

&nbsp;

Did that stop the old Tess? No! The Tess simply said,  
""I'll take all the good loot from the endgame instead!""  

&nbsp;

So she summoned her blue sparrow and shaded it gold.  
""I bet they won't even notice this sparrow is old!""  

&nbsp;

THEN she loaded some engrams and level ten gear,  
On her reskinned sparrow named Holiday Cheer.  

&nbsp;

Then the Tess said, ""Giddap!"" her intentions to assault,  
All the heartbroken guardians destroyed Gary their vault.  
 
&nbsp;

All their windows were dark. Quiet snow filled the air.  
All guardians were all dreaming sweet dreams of new lair.  
When she came to the first little house on the square.  

&nbsp;

""This is stop number one,"" Tess Everis hissed,  
And she looked in the window, ~~silver dust~~ shards in her fist.  

&nbsp;

Ready to take them for more or for less  
But, if Oryx could do it, then so could the Tess.  

&nbsp;

She saw few rooms over the glow of a light,  
The tennants appeared entertained a Fortnite.  

&nbsp;

""I'll make them pay for it and cleverly so.  
""This raid loot,"" she grinned, ""is the first thing to go!""  

&nbsp;

Then she slithered and slunk, with a smile most unpleasant,  
Around the whole room, she took their endgame presents!  

&nbsp;

Intellect! Discipline! Strength! T12! RNG!  
Primary! Secondary! Heavy! G&H! LMG!  

&nbsp;

And she stuffed them in bags. Then the Tess, very nimbly,  
Stuffed all the bags, ""Now in engrams they'll be!""  

&nbsp;

Now passing the station where playlists would tumble,  
She took from that list their beloved game, rumble!  

&nbsp;

She cleaned out the playlists so quick and so fast,  
""Their free-for-all playlist will now be in the past!""  

&nbsp;

Then she sparrowed away on her speeder with glee.  
""And NOW!"" grinned miss Tess, ""I will charge them a fee!""  

&nbsp;

And Tess stocked her shelves without worry or halt,  
Until next day she heard of the DTG salt.  

&nbsp;

She turned around fast and saw such a crowd,  
But ingored their complaints no matter how loud.  

&nbsp;

~~Activision Bungie~~ Tess had been caught quite red handed,  
Explanations of why the community demanded.  
 
&nbsp;

They stared at the Tess and said, ""Blue lady, why,”  
""Why are you taking our endgame fun? WHY?""  

&nbsp;

But, you know, smooth tongue Tess was so smart and so slick,  
She thought up a lie, and she thought it up quick!  

&nbsp;

""Why, my sweet guardians,"" said Tess with reply,  
""There's not enough reason to get you to buy.""  

&nbsp;

""So I'm making the endgame better, my dear.""  
""So you won't have to play there, I'll fix it up here!""  

&nbsp;

And her free gift exotic fooled all of that lot.  
""Though something felt missing,"" the community thought.  

&nbsp;

And when all the guardians entered the raid,  
""This loot table is missing some things, I'm afraid.""  

&nbsp;

To sweeten her pot she took random gun roll,  
""I can charge them for mods and they'll pay me a toll.  
""But something's still missing. A purpose a goal.""  

&nbsp;

So she looked at all other things she could claim,  
And add to her store with the Eververse name.  

&nbsp;

Her motive to make all players bump to a wall,  
And make all the players a filthy casual.  

&nbsp;

She thought of a new and splendid technique,  
So she made all the levels of experience leak.  
Packed her store with the ghosts! The shaders! The Ships!  
The armor! The consumables! The buffs! The Ornaments!  

&nbsp;

She lined them all up for the chumps to obtain,  
But limited their engrams to three they can claim.  

&nbsp;

""GG to the players!"" she was greedily humming.  
""They're finding out now to my store they're coming!""  
""They're just walking up! I know just what they'll do!""  
""They'll buy up a package of silver or two!""  
""Then bean counter suit-men will all shout WooHoo!""  

&nbsp;

""That's a noise,"" grinned miss Tess, ""That I simply MUST hear!""  
So she paused. And the Tess put her hand to her ear.  

&nbsp;

And she did hear a sound ringing out through snow.  
It started in low. Then it started to grow.  

&nbsp;

But the sound wasn't money! Why, this sound sounded merry!  
It couldn't be so! But it WAS merry! VERY!  

&nbsp;

She stared out the Tower! Miss Tess popped her eyes!  
Then she shook! What she saw was a shocking surprise!  

&nbsp;

Every guardian there present, the tall and the small,  
Was dancing! Without micro-transactions at all!  

&nbsp;

She HADN'T stopped veterans playing! THEY PLAYED!  
Somehow or other, they played just the same!  

&nbsp;

And Tess, with her loot shone bright in her store,  
Stood puzzling and puzzling: ""How can they play more?""  
""It came without rolls! It came without perks!""  
""It came without interest, what's wrong with these jerks!?""  

&nbsp;

And she puzzled three hours, till her puzzler was sore.  
Then Tess thought of something she hadn't before!  

&nbsp;

""Maybe the Dawning,"" she thought, ""doesn't come from a store.""  
""Maybe the Dawning...perhaps...means a little bit more!""  
  
&nbsp;

And what happened then? Well...in The Tower they say,  
That Tess' generosity grew three sizes that day!  

&nbsp;

And the minute her heart didn't feel quite so tight,  
She thought of a way to balance things right.  

&nbsp;

She put up her loot in public events to do,  
Produced for us, us Guardians, **2 tokens, 1 blue!**

The sad reason I need more solo content: all my friends are gone.,6737,8mlgg3,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/8mlgg3/the_sad_reason_i_need_more_solo_content_all_my/,864,1527490494.0,"I've noticed an uprising in posts regarding solo queueing in Crucible, and the need for improved matchmaking and other measures for solo PvE content.  I think something that needs to be talked about, that has so far been left out of the conversation, is *why* solo content is becoming so important.


I used to have an amazing raid group.  We formed at the start of TTK and we would reset raid every week.  We got to know each other really well and had a blast doing it.  There were plenty of shenanigans but we still managed to blast out 3x Oryx/Aksis in about 3-4 hours.  The rest of the week we'd hang out and play Crucible, Nightfalls, etc.  They were legitimate friends, even though it was over the online medium.


They're all gone now, *all* of them.  My friends list (for people playing Destiny) is a barren wasteland.  When I ask if they want to play, most are so jaded the response is something like ""screw that shitty game.""  Or, they ask me, ""why are you still playing Destiny?"" with complete incredulity.


This has left me with 2 main feelings about group play in D2.  First, I am less interested in joining a new clan or making a whole new set of friends, for the few times I have tried, those people have ended up disappearing too, and it totally sucks.  Second, as the population drops, LFG has become more toxic and I just don't have the time to grind prestige Calus 50x just to be invited into a group.


So, I need solo content.  I need matchmaking.  I want to play the game just to relax and get some stress out, and get some decent loot in the process.  But it seems like Bungie is still designing activities around the old population numbers and player base.  Escalation Protocol is a perfect example - with my old group I'd be happy to team up with 2 others and discuss tactics and coordinate weapons/roles and all that.  Now, I just would like to load into a zone and be able to complete it with a group of randoms, because it's just not as fun to try to mesh play styles with an LFG stranger.


So, the point of this, is that if anyone from Bungie sees this, I would appreciate if you started to develop more content towards solo players, because that seems to be the majority of who are left at this point.  I think people will return for the fall DLC, but I fear so many parts of the game are fundamentally broken (atmosphere, tone, abilities, the feel of weapons, loot, etc) that we'll never be at D1 levels of engagement.  That isn't necessarily a terrible thing, it just means Bungie needs to know who their audience *is*, instead of who they should be.

Personally I think for a long time Destiny has lost the leveling up aspect of the game. With Light Level only really being a chore to access new activities, and being pretty damn easy to come by in general. Thoughts?

Edit: u/Smurf-But-Blank made a great suggestion that armor masterworks should level up when you use its perks. For instance using hand cannons when you have a hand cannon targeting perk would level up th armor. Or Remote connection when you get sniper kills. ",2019-03-21 08:44:34

Entrance could simply be the portal on Mercury or a tab within the Mercury map like it is in the Tower at the moment

Brother Vance could have a powerful bounty,  rewarding his loot and some Masterwork Cores. The bounty sends you to kill a bunch of bosses or to get to branch 7. 5 Branches if soloing. He could offer several bounties for shards, glimmer, materials and just legendary items. 

The Mercury gear is good and I’d love to use them but some of their rolls are trash and they’re Year I weapons not gear 2 so giving them random rolls will make them worth while to use. 

All I could say is that if they do it the Year 2 Vanguard and Crucible armours are going to need to be thrown out for something new since it’s a copy paste of the Mercury set with a different paint job. Especially if they’re going to use the Mercury armour as rewards within the Haunted Forest.

I have never seen such a display of unbelievable stupidity and lack of awareness. 

In no particular order, I have seen:

* A Hunter went into spectral blades against a Cyclops, and was promptly deleted from the game from the other Cyclops and the Minotaurs around them. 
* 2 Guardians waiting by the Portal for an invasion, while we were on 74 motes. The other team had their primeval. The worst part of this was the fact 3 motes were right next to them, left behind from an invader not moments before. 
* 2 Hunters embracing their inner Titan and meleeing the Primeval. Which would be fine, were they wearing Liars Handshake, or if the Envoys had been killed. Nope. Promptly killed. Revives. Does it again.
* A Warlock with 15 motes ran headfirst towards an invader, despite the fact that same invader had just destroyed two other players with a shotgun in what was actually a very impressive play. Guardian down.
* A Titan dropped a bubble during a Meatball round, and blew himself up inside it with a rocket. It was D1 all over again. 
* During a sudden death, a Blueberry decided to use hammers against the meatball. Which was immune the entire time. Didn't stop them lobbing hammers at it though. 

I do worry for some people. I really do. These people might have reached an age where they are able to vote.

Massive Breakdown of a System to Bring Back Subclass Customization and Provide Players with More Choice as to How They Play,6596,agz3wt,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/agz3wt/massive_breakdown_of_a_system_to_bring_back/,519,1547769186.0,"**Let's start at the beginning:**

I think removing the ability to choose individual perks for the subclasses was one of the most unfortunate things to come out of D2. I very much believe that we should be able to choose how we want to play, and not just get a general clump of perks to use. As such, I've gone back and looked over the D1 subclass system, brought in the new D2 perks and subclasses we've been given, and molded it to try to make it closer to an RPG experience. Most importantly, it's based on the fact that there doesn't need to be the exact same amount of perks for each subclass/archetype. With asymmetric subclasses, perks could be added into the grid as content releases, providing more variability and more exciting options for players without having to invent entirely new skill trees or subclasses. The basic system is as follows:

* Each subclass gets:
 * Class Ability - 2 standard options
 * Grenade - 3 standard options
 * Jump - 3 standard options
 * Super - Either 1 or 2 options.
 * Melee - 3-5 options
 * Up to 5 Subclass Perks: 3-5 options in each, can improve the Super, Grenades, Melee, Movement, Abilities in general, or be Utility perks

So, as a player, you basically get to choose one option from each perk slot. 

As a developer, you would focus on whichever subclass has the most blanks to fill in, and add new perks when a content drop happens if need be. The stronger the subclass in the current sandbox, the less it has a need for more perks. Similarly, weaker subclasses can be given far more options. 

At the end of D2, if things went as planned, every subclass would have their 10x5 grid filled out, and would have 2 supers to choose from as well. There would, of course, have to be some balance changes put in place to help kick start this process to prevent certain choices from being OP, and I will detail the changes I would make in a later post. 

I encourage anyone who is interested in theory-crafting to go look at their preferred subclass, and see what type of combinations could be made with a system like this.

"Can we get rid of that bug when applying a shader, ornament or whatever, it cancels when the bar is almost full.",6591,a7zu22,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/a7zu22/can_we_get_rid_of_that_bug_when_applying_a_shader/,288,1545353579.0,"It's so annoying.

Edit 4: It's not latency, neither your controller/mouse, neither being in specific areas and neither loading screens (according to a another guardian), then I think it should be a **bug**, like I original thought.

Edit 1: Some folks said is due to latency which I *half* believe is correct and, this happens almost with all the things that requires the action to hold the button for a moment, yet I notice that some things like infusing and dismantling shaders (for me) is not affected by this, instead of holding the button to repeat the process due to latency problems, it won't let you do it until the action performs.

If it ~~is~~ *were* latency problems, the game shouldn't let you do it over and over again until the action performs, it's like what you just did, didn't happen.

Edit 2: Another fellow guardians saying that either your stick or mouse which ever you're using, doesn't have to move at all or it will cause this, I wonder how sensitive this is since even myself with a new controller with no deadzones it still happens, *quite odd considering this happens only when the bar is almost full*.

Edit 3: With all the comments now I think it's not latency, due to the fact that I put in the ""Edit 1"" when it's a matter of latency the action gets a delay in to do it, but it won't let you do it again.

Neither it is the stick or mouse barely moving, because why would it cancel only when the bar is almost full, also a comment said that it still fills if you move your stick (I'm not sure about this).

It is also not the place where you currently are since some comments said that they got the problem in the tower and in orbit was fine, while another said the opposite.

I believe now is the loading screens sections the source of this problems, since a comment point out this was not a problem in D1 and it is D2, and why? Because the loading times are quite long in D2 (especially in console), kinda funny and dumb since loading screens is where we are gonna to this stuff.",2018-12-21 08:52:59

"Curse of Osiris and the next ""expansion"" should NOT be paid DLC - the season pass should only include major updates akin to The Taken King",6596,7hx6ta,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/7hx6ta/curse_of_osiris_and_the_next_expansion_should_not/,868,1512584735.0,"In Destiny 1, we experienced the Dark Below and the House of Wolves, which were essentially just small updates with a few extra hours of content. There was a lot of upset about the fact that these were both $20 ""expansions"", and that Limited Edition and Season Pass holders felt cheated of their money.

In response to this, we were told that in the future, with the help of Eververse, content like this would be available for *free*, as those of us who bought into microtransactions would be those funding the progress of the game. The idea behind this would then be that we would only pay for the large expansions, like The Taken King. This is what **SHOULD** have happened with Destiny 2, especially given the increased reliance on Eververse for cosmetic items.

But instead, we're right back to Destiny 1 - only this time, with microtransactions already in place. We were hopeful that Curse of Osiris would be a large-scale update, similar to Rise of Iron, but instead we got a new House of Wolves. A small new social space, a few hours of missions/quests, and a new end-game activity. Not a full Raid, but an end-game activity.

So here's the thing: Curse of Osiris (and given the release of CoO, the new expansion too) should be **free**. It should come as a seasonal update to the live game, to keep players engaged and coming back for more. With a release like this every quarter or so, Destiny 2 would be filled with content within a year. But instead, we're going to get another tiny piece of DLC in the Spring of 2018, and then no doubt there will be an *actual* major expansion at the end of 2018 - welcome the pyramid ships.

And THAT major update is the only one we should have to pay for. It should bring 10+ hours of new story, with all new adventures, locations, and MORE THAN ONE new Lost Sector. It should provide a full set of new end-game activities, with a new Raid, new, exciting exotic quests and weapons, and challenging patrol activities like the Archon's Forge, and Court of Oryx. That is an update I would gladly pay good money for. A $40 DLC to justify the $40 Season Pass price point. Not two $10 DLCs charged at twice the price.

This is for anyone that thinks there should be a refund or something similar cause you bought it when it wasn’t free: depreciation exists in any market. Things get cheaper over time, in this case it’s free. Say you bought a brand new car 2019 model for 20k, in a few years it will be worth let’s say 10k. Would you go to the car dealer and ask for part of your money back cause it’s cheaper now? No, that’s stupid. The game market moves much faster so we see it on a greater scale. 

I see so many comments about bungie making the annual pass free and people asking for refunds. it’s making me cringe how little knowledge of how money works everyone has. You made the decision to buy the annual pass, you played a years worth of content on the annual pass and now you expect a refund because they decided to make it free. Please take a finance class people.

Not sure why Bungie retired the old armour sets but if you bring them back, they should come with perks that activate when wearing more of the armour set, like Gambit Prime armour but for strikes. This would incentivise players to go after these armour sets again, as I don’t think anyone were too interested in replaying story missions with no powerful reward to gain.

Of course Ikora would request significantly more strike tokens in order for you to receive these rewards and the reward pool could be expanded upon with new guns, which would make up for the lack of new gear this season (though I doubt this will happen this season). She could even have weekly strike bounties that give these items powerful rewards.

"Destiny is one of the most shallow, linear, vertical progression MMO-esque games ever and it's a shame.",6541,7ay4rq,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/7ay4rq/destiny_is_one_of_the_most_shallow_linear/,1464,1509924230.0,"I'm a PC player new to Destiny and let me say after reading up on the games lore and watching vids from Byf I was more than excited to jump into the Destiny universe. The game looks great, plays great and sounds great but is shallow to a fault.

ZERO horizontal progression. We essentially all play the same characters with the same weapons and how we dress and the color of our weapons seems to be the only difference. 

No crafting, resources or skill trees. I mean you could argue there are skills but.....c'mon now.

DLC coming with a new power level and level cap which is more linear vertical progression. I won't even compare games like Guild Wars 2 or Elder Scrolls Online from a horizontal progression standpoint because Destiny is a shooter first and I get it but even games like The Division, Warframe and hell even Defiance have more depth. It's a real shame that all of the great things about this game are wasted on a lack of depth. Not salty just really disappointed. 

EDIT: Just want to add that I'm in love with the game from an aesthetic and gameplay perspective. MMO-esque and co-op games for the most part take place in a pure fantasy setting and Destiny's world, lore, gear, weapons etc are a breath of fresh air. I ABSOLUTELY love all of those things and just want a reason to play it more.

EDIT: I want to clarify that I got my monies worth out of Destiny 2. I don't feel ripped off. It was fun until I hit a wall when the lack of diversity in gear/weapons/mods and the games overall simplicity started to show. I say it's a shame because the lore and world are things I find fascinating. 

EDIT: I'm not even a hardcore player like many in the comments have assumed. This game is even too linear and ""dumbed down"" for a casual player. Bungie's goal is to keep people returning to the world and I don't think that will happen for many PC players if the only reasons to return are in the form of paid DLC.

"4 months ago I talked about how Destiny was a 4th wall breaking experience, now that you all know now it is, let's go deeper.",6522,beoavx,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/beoavx/4_months_ago_i_talked_about_how_destiny_was_a_4th/,619,1555637369.0,"Hello everyone, 4 months ago you may have seen a thread I published about [how the Ahamkara and Hive basically tell us that this game is literally a game.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/a0qmut/destiny_is_a_giant_fourth_wall_breaking/)

But it was met with some criticism that I was looking to deep into it. Turns out, I was looking at it exactly as it was intended.

Yes, real life is our Throne World. Yes Destiny is literally a game. In fact look at it this way, we are so powerful that these people's entire existence is just a game to us. That's lore now.

But let's start to breakdown things we have in front of us, and what it could possibly mean:

- The Emissary is not a correspondent between Guardians and The Nine, it is our correspondent with the game itself. As in, The Emissary is bridging the gap between you as a human real life player, and the mechanics of Destiny's universe. She knows we are real, she knows where it all stands in perspective.

- There is quite literally no challenge this game (or any game for that matter) could ever present us that would ever beat us. You can wipe 2,000 times, and in the game you are still going to be alive. You will still win. You cannot lose.

- Even if you were to literally delete your character, and uninstall the game, you have won. Why? Because you have insta deleted any and all possible foes this game could ever present you as both a guardian and player. You've won.

- Even if a boss deleted your character upon killing you, you aren't dead. You can create an infinite amount of characters, and take on the same challenges an infinite amount of times.

- You know all the different timelines Osiris' clone army goes to? Well, a large majority of those ""alternate timelines"" are just other players doing the same activities but in different ways. They are all happening at the same time, all different, and all relevant.

- The Ahamkara, unlike the Nine currently, understand this. They want out, literally. The Ahamkara understands you are human, that they are in a game. Their main goal is to be ""real"" like you and I. When you step away from the game, the moment you even think of Wish Dragons and Ahamkara you are giving them what they want. You are applying them outside of the realm of the game. You are making them more ""real"" in a dimension outside of where they are constrained too. That is partially why Riven says she is a part of you now. You have met her, you've killed her, and your going to keep that experience for the rest of your life. In a mental way, she is a part of you. Which gives her power. 

- The Vex are simulating a simulation of a simulation. A game of a game of games. 

- The darkness could, in many ways, mean the literal end of the game. When we beat the main bad guy at the end of the franchise, at some point your going to turn the game off. The servers will turn off. Darkness has come, a new dark age begins. Which is funny, before Destiny was released the B.net community referred to the time between Reach and Destiny as the ""Dark Age"". Bungie had gone dark, and a very small rag tag of Bungie fanatics stayed on through till we saw the light. Before the game existed, the darkness had won. The game was then created, dark and light met at odds thus creating the world we now play, then light really entered the game when we all did. We are the embodiment of light. We give the game life, we are what keeps the lights on. The moment we all leave, dark again.

Does this mean Destiny has no stakes? No, the point of a game is to be invested in the journey. Just because we now have rooted omnipotence in the games lore, doesn't mean that each new enemy, each new threat and expansion has no meaning. 

So often we are told power (light level, weapons, armor, etc.) is what we are after. The Emissary says no for a reason, that's not just what we are after. We are after an experience, something The Nine can't fathom.

And if we really want to go beyond it all. The Nine could be/is/are Bungie. Because they are constantly vying to understand us, the player, the human. 

Hope you've enjoyed this thread.

With the apology, the new bundle offers, and a closer look at ""Year One"" rewards, I'm sure many people have had their issues resolved. Not to mention the Bungie Day reward (which was fully expected, but the rejection thereof was also part of the statement).

I'm still going through with it because I feel like it's ridiculous that we had to kick and scream and get the media's attention just to get them to treat veteran players like everyone else. There's also the issue of our foreign friends still getting seriously shafted on price (an issue that has gone completely unaddressed up to this point). I feel like this whole ordeal just exemplifies the general disconnect between Bungie and its players at the moment, and that's been the point of this ""boycott"" the whole time.

At this point, I don't expect a large participation, but it's still a message I'm going to stand by. So if you've still got issues with Bungie's apparent business model as of late, as far as anyone is concerned, this is still happening.

-------

EDIT: This has definitely evolved from the pretty lukewarm discussion I started before I went to bed into an actual discussion of grievances or lack thereof and how we should act based on either perception. I'd like to start by thanking everyone (for or against) for some pretty thoughtful responses. I would like to address a few things on a personal note, though. Buckle up for some lengthy responses or you can just skip to the original post.

First, for me, it's not about the emotes. I ended on that little line to emphasize how strange it is that the powers that be feel like $40 extra for special collectibles alone is a good value. Sure, it's a phenomenal deal for new players, but older ones aren't just encouraged to shell out the full cost of the expansion for a few cosmetic items - Bungie fully expects us to (and we've proven them right). While it may not be about the emotes for me, I can't really blame people playing a loot-driven game for being upset that exclusive loot is locked behind such an outrageous paywall.

On the topic of cost, personally, it's not about the price of the expansion itself, either. With the previous DLCs costing $20, $40 for TTK makes sense. I've sunk so much time into this game with my friends and I've had a great time doing it. The cost of development is increasing, game prices are staying the same, and Destiny has some pretty hefty backend hardware to maintain. There's a lot of cost that goes into this, and while it's pricier than most, this is a very MMO-styled expansion schedule. However, the cost for our friends with ""foreign"" money is definitely something they have a right to be upset about. This expansion is a measly £5 less than the full game on launch and is actually more expensive than other recent releases like Witcher 3. This only alienates any player not in America, and again, they're expected to just lap it up without so much as a whimper.

Third, it's not about getting revenge on Luke Smith. It seems that way because he's such an obvious target to point at in this moment, but I realize he's just a lead designer (""just"" used very loosely, but...). He doesn't make these decisions and he's never been good at PR. At the same time, you don't get on a podium and declare your entire fanbase a collection of slobbering idiots who'd throw their money at you for showing a video of a golf clap. This leads into why I'm actually upset and why I made this post in the first place: there's no respect.

In a game like this where you rely on gamers to form their own communities and you rely on their feedback to constantly improve the game to appeal to more players/retain the ones you've got, there needs to be some level of respect between the developers and players. That's how it is with just about every successful MMO, and while Destiny isn't one fully, it borrows a lot from that genre. We, as players, are vitriolic 9 times out of 10 for sure. We're pretty nasty sometimes. Still, with the emissaries Bungie has given us like Deej, we've managed a fairly civil dialogue (on the whole) up until now and we've seen great improvements as a result. If you look at launch Destiny compared to today's Destiny, it's insane how much this game has actually gotten better. It's not perfect, but it's still a huge step forward. However, between the pricing schemes being irreverent of existing and foreign players, effectively withholding content (as small as it may be), and the PR nightmare of that interview, there was a very real picture coming into focus of contempt towards us existing players. There was no respect; we're idiots with cash. That hinders a lot of our ability to actively communicate with Bungie and to have Bungie communicate with us, and with the expected longevity of the game, this communication is essential.

I'm not going to stop playing Destiny altogether because I do still enjoy the game and I believe that it can be more. I'm not expecting a sit-out to be earth-shattering, but I think one of the most active communities taking a day off (and on the Weekly reset, no less, when they're used to seeing huge traffic spikes) does send them a message when they boast of our daily time investment. If you want to go further and refuse to purchase TTK, I'm right there with you, but I felt like this would be something small and preemptive to hopefully get a message across before the train got too far off the tracks.

I realize that Deej has since addressed the issue of respecting player investment as a topic in this week's Weekly Update. I look forward to hearing what he says, and I encourage you to give the man a chance to speak before we beat the war drums too hard. They still nuked the business-client relationship, though. It's wise to keep Luke's attitude in mind as we move forward into future expansions and determine if that's the kind of attitude you want to support with your money.

Things like LFG sites that were made to compensate for the lack of matchmaking; like [DestinyPublicEvents](http://destinypublicevents.com/) or [Destiny Item Manager](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/destiny-item-manager/apghicjnekejhfancbkahkhdckhdagna?hl=en); like [Destiny Ghost Hunter](http://destinyghosthunter.net/) or sites that give you a better look at the Grimoire so that you have even the slightest clue as to what story actually exists in this game. The list can go on. We as a community put a lot of time and effort into making this game more than we were given. And don't get me wrong, there are some fantastic people at Bungie working their hardest to constantly improve the game, to listen to us and implement as much feedback as they can, to give use the tools needed to build everything I just mentioned. I get that. I'm hugely grateful for them, too.

However, we can't let an attitude like Luke Smith's dictate the future of this game without being contested. We shouldn't, anyways. We didn't just play this game; we invested in their community. We invested our time and talents to enrich the experience for each other in ways the game itself couldn't. Yet now we're being treated like we're nothing more than a pile of wallets? I get that they're a business, but you don't build a strong base for a game that's supposed to last 10 years by ostracizing and insulting your existing player-base.

For that reason, I implore anyone reading this to consider taking a day off. Just one day of either watching Netflix or playing a different game (new Batman, yes?) or anything else, really. That Tuesday, when they expect all of us to rush back into the weekly events and start knocking out our chores (likely even offering us some trinket to celebrate their favorite day of the year), let's actually show them what happens if we take our business elsewhere. Let's try to drive their server numbers to record lows. Let's organize ourselves as the community that wants this game to be as great as we know it can be and tell them in a way that even Activision can understand that we don't agree with their direction and we're not afraid to go elsewhere (especially after that E3 we were given this year). They need to stay competitive to retain us, so please, I only ask that you consider grabbing your friends and playing something else on Bungie Day this year. Show them that we matter just as much as any new players they mean to attract. 

It's your choice as to how the future of this game shapes up, so do you want to try to make a statement or do you want to pay $40 for exclusive dance moves?",2015-06-23 21:56:23

Edit: This is being driven by us, the fans and players.  The louder our voice, the more likely it will happen. 

Edit 2: Many people are concerned with PC vs Console PvP and yet no one has said anything about PvE being a problem.  PvP should be separate queues unless you opt-in to play against PC players, similar to the Fortnite model.

Edit 3: For everyone saying that Sony will never allow this, please [see the recent news](https://blog.us.playstation.com/2018/09/26/extended-fortnite-cross-play-beta-launches-on-ps4-starting-today/) about that wall crumbling for Fortnite.  Saying that it will never happen is exactly why it won't.  

Edit 4: Apologies for saying ""sister company"", it was meant thematically, e.g. they are somewhat similar, and not that they were owned by the same parent.

Edit 5: Guardians, thanks for having a reasonable and well thought discussion on this topic!  This is how you get people to listen.  This community and all of you are wonderful!1

Edit 7: A few people have pointed out that Blizzard has responded to this news in a [statement to VG247](https://www.vg247.com/2018/10/12/diablo-3-cross-platform-play-update/).  I don't think this has any relevance to the idea of cross-play or cross-saves within Destiny 2 aside from a potential loss of additional industry pressure; we can still share our thoughts and express our desires to see this capability be added.  This also sounds like a classic PR statement for something that may have been accidentally disclosed ahead of schedule.  Up to everyone to decide how to interpret that.

---

Five years ago, we began a journey together (and for some of us at Bungie, many years before that when Destiny was just an idea). There have been great, unbelievable days and dark, dark days (I won’t repeat myself, but the closing of [Director’s Cut, Pt. 3](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48072) touches on it), and in five years, A LOT has changed from September 9, 2014 – you, me, the Bungie team, Destiny, and the world. 


During 2019, we’ve developed and shared a clarity of vision we’ve never had before in Destiny. We’re finally going to make the Destiny 2 we’ve always wanted to make—one world that you and your friends are going to meaningfully change and make memories in. This year, our team has felt the full weight of what we’re responsible for (even on your worst days in the game, no one is harder on us than ourselves). But we now have a unified purpose. A calling. 


October 1st is the first step toward what we want Destiny 2 to become. Everything we’re doing this fall is more than just any one part – it is Destiny 2 fundamentally evolving and in some ways starting new. It’s Shadowkeep, it’s New Light, it’s Cross Save, it’s you, me, and our friends together. It’s all of it. 


This isn’t just the next chapter of Destiny 2, but the next chapter of us. 


Tomorrow, that journey begins again for all of us and many, many others. These past few months have been awesome with you. Thanks for being the bright points of light shining in the night. You are Destiny’s stars. Be that light for the new Guardians wandering around the Tower, soloing a public event, dropping into Crucible for the first time, or trying to learn Raid mechanics you can do with your eyes shut. We were all Kinderguardians once. 


Let’s help each other, make some memories, and head back to the Moon and see what’s been going on there for the last five years. It’s weird to say five years in, but given the year we’ve had: we’re just getting started. 


See you soon.

"Can we get rid of the shader inventory, and just apply the shaders we have unlocked in collections?",6449,a8b011,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/a8b011/can_we_get_rid_of_the_shader_inventory_and_just/,276,1545434708.0,"How this would work is when you see the dropdown list of shaders when applying one to a piece of gear, you would see all of the shaders unlocked in collections instead of the 50 shaders in your inventory.  The cost of buying the shader could be added to the cost of applying it, so we could buy and apply shaders all in one button press, instead of worrying about rather we have enough of a certain one.  And most importantly, this would eliminate the tedious work of micro-managing your shader inventory.

**How to unlock new shaders:**

Currently, we unlock a shader in collections after it is put into our inventory.  With this change, new shaders could be dropped as one-time consumables, like ornaments, that unlock the shader in collections when used.  Where we would have recieved duplicate shaders, we could just receive the price of applying the shader (glimmer, legendary shards, bright dust, etc.).  So instead of Tess giving us 3 shaders in a bright engram, she would give us enough bright dust to apply 3 eververse shaders.

**New Filtering options:**

Since the list of shaders would be huge compared to the 50 we have now, it would also be nice to have some new filters for the list of shaders we see when applying one.  Sort by: recently used, most used, rarity, and favorites would be nice additions.  Being able to mark certain shaders as ""favorites"" would be nice since, if you're like me, you really only use about 5-10 different shaders and all of the other ones kind of just waste space.

**Transitioning to the new system:**

If this were to happen, at the time of the update our current stock of shaders could be auto-dismantled and the resources from dismantling could be added to our inventory.  Sure some of us might miss out on some glimmer if we're at or near the cap, but as long as we're warned about it prior to the update and given a chance to sink some glimmer beforehand, it would be fine.  And I think a lot of us would be okay on missing out on a little glimmer in exchange for a permanent solution to the shader problem.

**Pros:**

- Saves room in both our post master and our vault
- Eliminates the need for micro-managing shaders
- Could work as a permanent solution to the re-occurring issues with the shader economy
- Frees up server space per account to allow for more filtering and customization options

**Cons:**

- The large amount of work this would require on Bungie's part
- Shaders can no longer be stored for emergency glimmer/bright dust funds",2018-12-22 07:25:08

Don't judge me pls.)*

&#x200B;

\*\*\***IMPORTANT EDIT:** It has also been suggested that both the MW cores and the here explained progression system could exist alongside each other, which I agree completely with. That way players who have enough cores can maximize their gear instantly, and ""poorer"" players still have ways to maximize their gear without rare resources. I like this idea even more than removing the cores completely. **/edit**

&#x200B;

The recent glitch that allowed some few lucky people to farm literally thousands of free MW cores for 2 hours was the final trigger to completely destroy the core economy in Destiny 2 for me.

At this point there are so many complaints about the MW core system (e.g. how inconsistently you obtain them, that they're used for infusion...) that I don't understand why Bungie is still trying so hard to defend them. Right now they're still spending resources on creating a complicated system for next season to earn cores. These resources would be much better spent on trying to create an actual progress system for masterwork levels that rewards you for playing with that specific gear piece.

&#x200B;

**How usage based masterwork levels should work:**  
*(Please note that the sample numbers are only my opinion, they may seem too high or too low for some players. I think they shouldn't be too low because it should feel like an actual accomplishment to wear a shiny golden masterworked gear piece, but they also shouldn't be too high because there's so much stuff to possibly masterwork. Tell me what you think!)*

* **Weapons:** by getting kills and generally dealing damage with that weapon. Sample PVE kill numbers:  
*(for primary weapons only, would need adjustments for special/heavy weapons and multiplied PVP progress)*
   * Level 2: 10 kills
   * Level 3: 20 kills *(Note: you have to get an* ***additional*** *20 kills from Lvl 2 to 3, so you need 30 kills total for Lvl 3. This is how it works for every following number as well, including the armor numbers.)*
   * Level 4: 40 kills
   * Level 5: 80 kills
   * ...
   * Level 10: 2560 kills *(That's a total of 5110 PVE kills for mw level 2-10 on a primary weapon.)*
* **Armor:** by simply wearing it while doing activities and by taking damage. Sample numbers for wear time:  
*(At first glance the time numbers will seem way too high, but remember that you're always progressing 5 armor pieces at the same time (4 if an exotic equipped), so divide those numbers by 5 and you get the times for individual pieces.)*
   * Level 2: 30 minutes OR 3 activity completions *(activity = anything that has a ""Mission completed"" message, e.g. Strikes and Blind Well)*
   * Level 3: 60 minutes OR 6 activity completions
   * Level 4: 120 minutes OR 12 activity completions
   * Level 5: 240 minutes OR 24 activity completions *(That's a total of 450min / 7.5h for mw level 2-5, which equals 90min per individual armor piece)*

All these numbers are only examples and would need adjustments for the different weapon types (primary, special, heavy) and a PVE/PVP balance. They only serve as a base for how I would imagine a proper masterwork system. If they are way off your imagination I'd love to hear why, please tell me your opinion in the comments!

&#x200B;

**TL;DR: Bungie should stop wasting resources on the core system and just remove them from the game. It would be much better if masterwork levels on weapons/armor would increase by using them (on weapons by getting kills/dealing damage, on armor just by wear time or taking damage).**

* Remove Kinetic attack mods, and make legendary mods more effective than rare mods (ex. -10 sec cooldown for legendary and only -5 sec for rare). 
* Give us one exotic weapon mod and one exotic armour mod to equip. 
* Use the mod system to end the random roll debate
* Have specific PvE and PvP mod perks (recycle perks from D1 if necessary; think RoI artifacts and D1 raid gear)
* Tie mods to endgame activities that are relevant to said engame activity
* Give each subclass an exotic mod
* Do NOT use Eververse as a way to sell mods
* Remove the $5000 price tag of applying mods

It'll be interesting to see what Bungie comes up with for the next strikes we get, or if strikes will be put on hold until we get new enemy units or races in a large expansion or D3.

"Can we get a Gambit bounty that is just ""Defeat 10 Primeval Envoys""",6409,9nku0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/9nku0p/can_we_get_a_gambit_bounty_that_is_just_defeat_10/,581,1539384076.0,"Bonus points: it should get ""stuck"" and be available every day.

Taking a look at the Gambit bounties, there's around a quarter of them that have goals that can be actively problematic for people queueing up who like to win (multikills with RL/GL, kills with specific ability energy types, kill enemies with Sidearms while jumping, etc.).

Why not have bounties that more clearly reinforce skills and tactics that are important for the game type? If players are rewarded for doing the ""smart"" thing, they… might… learn?",2018-10-13 06:41:16

A few suggestions I've seen about for what each person could do as well as a few of my own. You don't need to do all or even any of these but do SOMETHING:

&#x200B;

**Ikora:** Bring back her story vendor feature. Give her world drops. Give her drops you earned in the past that can't be reearnd right now. Maybe have her be some kind of intelligence gather missions or bounties for Hidden rewards. Have her get us to study lore to unlock rewards, or turn her into a lore or cutscene viewer.

&#x200B;

**Amanda:** Let her add perks to sparrows. Give her some buyable or earnable sparrows that are not trash. Bring back SRL and have her be the vendor. Have her give out some kind of sparrow related missions or bounties like driving through points like in D1. Make her a Build a Sparrow thing where you can customize it's looks and earn parts.

&#x200B;

**Faction vendors:** Bring back factions like they were in D1. Have a PVP Faction War Mode. Make patrols do stuff for factions and give out their tokens when you pledge. Have a faction PVEVP area where you can fight Guardians and enemies at once ~~preferably without losing anything~~. Give them back their exotic cloaks so you can show your colors.",2019-09-09 01:20:52

Today. On the final day of Destiny before the sequel. I chose to accept a random invite from a blueberry in the tower. What followed was one of the greatest experiences I had playing a video game.,6401,6y54tk,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/6y54tk/today_on_the_final_day_of_destiny_before_the/,436,1504608299.0,"So earlier in the day me and my friends were playing Wrath of the Machine doing a fresh run and right as we started Aksis Phase 2 the worst ISP in the universe aka Comcast decided to shut off my internet. They've been doing this for months now so I call my friend and tell him he might as well get someone else because I'm not coming back.

I do some troubleshooting and suddenly my internet magically works again. I rejoin to find that another person had taken my place and listen in as 3 minutes later they finish the raid. 

Later I'm sitting in the tower decrypting engrams and getting ready to log off and suddenly I'm hit with the notification that someone had invited me, and I see a Warlock joyfully running around me with 2000 Grimoire. I decided to join him as I didn't want my last time playing destiny before d2 to be of a black screen and I had never accepted a random invite from the tower before. He (hereby referred to as Hoop) said he wanted to the nightfall 380 version. I'm like ""okay there are no other versions but alright"". I ask him if he happened to know what the nightfall is this week and he says 

Hoop: Crap I don't remember.. Something with an ogre?

Me: Abomination?

Hoop: No something with like he walks around and beats you to death..

My heart sank

Me: Kovik?

Hoop: yeah the priest

Uh oh. I have to carry this 391 through a strike which even I, a LL 400 Year 1 player, struggles to complete the **350** version of. Challenge Accepted.

I warned him beforehand that there was a very strong possibility that we wouldn't get through this. He said he was ok with it but he wanted to at least try it. He invited his friend (hereby referred to as Kv) while I sorted out Hoops loadouts, told him to put on self-rez, etc. I realize at this point that Kv, also a sunsinger, is only LL 344 and that he didn't have Self-Rez unlocked yet.

My heart sank into hell at this point. 

I gave Kv the same warning about not getting through it and he gave back the same response as Hoop. They wanted to do it. 

We load up the strike and get to the boss fairly easily. We wipe a few times but those attempts aren't documented here. What's important to know is that as we fought together we grew more coordinated and got farther each time with Hoop mainly distracting the ogre as me and Kv shot Kovik. (In hindsight it probably wasn't the best idea as Kv had significantly lower level but Hoop was good at keeping himself above the ogres head so I didn't question it). And along the way Hoop realized why I had him put on the Fireborn perk:

Hoop: oh shit I can bring myself *back to life?*

Me: ....yeah

Hoop: fucking cool!

I have no idea how he hadn't figured that out as he had the perk unlocked, it says in the description what the perk does AND he said he had been playing the game for a year now.. like.. How does that even happen??

And here is the story of *The Attempt*. The reason in which I made this post.


We had gotten very far into the fight. The boss had 1/4 of his health left. We had never gotten this far and I could tell *they* had never gotten this far

Kv: ^Im ^so ^nervous ^right ^now.

Me: We're fine dude stay cool

During this point there were so many ads on the board that we had just kept dying and picking each other back up. At one point Hoop was the only one left.

Me: Hoop you're gonna have to loop around and come get me.

Hoop: Alright

Kv: I have so much faith in you right now man

Hoop looped around the left pillar and came and got me, making sure that the right pillar was always between Kovik and himself. 

I ran and got Kv and I just said ""Fucking shoot 'em, just fucking shoot 'em guys!!

The boss had literally the smallest pixel of health remaining and I could hear my teammates cries of desperation quickly turning into celebration

And then [](#s ""**A BLACK SCREEN**"")

I just sat in my chair as I came to terms with what had happened.

""Oh my god I got dropped!! **OH MY GOD**""

I quickly got my phone out and used the PlayStation app to message them quickly 

Me: Oh my god I got dropped did you guys kill him?? Please tell me you got him!!

Kv: [](#s ""We died"")

Me: I'm so sorry dude

Me: Fucking Comcast

Me: I'm so sorry

I felt so horrible that that happened. My heart fucking broke into a million billion piec-

Kv: Jk

Kv: We won

*You. Fucking. Cunt.*

They had won. *We won.*

And in that moment I swore that that would be the final time I played Destiny before the sequel came out. This memory absolutely tops anything that happened during my entire 3 year journey. I will always remember it as the time we triumphed over the incredible odds against us.

From now on I want every Guardian to not just ignore that invite you get from a blueberry, but to follow that little blueberry wherever it takes you. Follow that Blueberry, see where it takes you, and never look back. I know I won't.

Thank you Bungie for an incredible game experience

Make a crucible playlist without supers or heavy,6391,clfcsh,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/clfcsh/make_a_crucible_playlist_without_supers_or_heavy/,941,1564840305.0,"It’s pretty common knowledge by now that about 2ish minutes into any game of PvP, the super chain begins. Then you can expect at least 1-2 supers per life, which leads to plenty of running away or futilely trying to fight them. Added on top of that is the rampant amount of power ammo, especially in MGs. 

Now don’t get me wrong, I love the power fantasy of destiny, but I think a great addition to the crucible game mode selection would a playlist without supers and either very limited or no heavy. This way it will be possible to enjoy the entire game instead of only the first 2 minutes.

Edit: a lot of people are bringing up d2 vanilla in terms of being pretty much only primary gunfights, to which I agree were boring -BUT- we are now in a totally different meta with faster move speeds and faster times to kill all around the board. As I stated earlier, this would be a gamemode, not THE game. So if you don’t want to play then that’s totally up to you.

Here is a link for people who clicked the title and still are coming to post negative things: https://www.reddit.com/r/LowSodiumDestiny/**

I got into Destiny back in freshman year of college (3 years ago) and my god was it magnificent... I came in right as Crota's raid was being released. I think it was after the Vex got nerfed from being OP in PvP lol.

Destiny by far has got to be one of the best games I've ever played in my life. I'm sorry but no other game can match the movement mechanics that I insanely love. I never discriminated; had all 3 classes maxed and everything.

I definitely was addicted to D1 like no other, spending nearly every day after classes playing and even being up at reset at 4am to do everything and then do everything all over again with friends. The guns were awesome, gameplay was awesome, story was ok (I didn't care much for story), grimoire was awesome, everything was awesome! I completed Crota's End raid more than 130 times, even helping people achieve the Flawless Raider (https://www.reddit.com/r/Fireteams/comments/4mxhld/xb1_flawless_raider_achievement/).

D1 affected my freshman year negatively, and maybe sophomore year a little as well. To be honest, when D2 came out I started getting back into my gaming habits but with every update making the game worse, I'm actually glad I'm leaving the Destiny universe behind. I still browse r/DTG and r/raidsecrets because it's fun to know what's going on and whatnot.

Honestly, I want to say so much more but at the same time I don't, and I don't know why I made this post either, but a huge thank you for showing us just how easy it is to mess something up even though you have all of the knowledge beforehand to make it perfect. It's like preparing for a test while having the answer key in your hands and still getting an F.

What you don't realize is just how amazing of a fan-base you had created,and how ***easily***, and I mean ***#easily*** you could have kept the saga going and kept each and everyone and maybe even have added millions and millions more to the player-base as well! I just can't believe this is how it's all turning out... D1, you will be greatly missed! I hope that after I have graduated college and have a job and my life is more stable, I can really get back into gaming and by then Bungie creates an out-of-the-park Destiny game. I know you can do it Bungie. ***Listen to the players.***

**Edit:** I was honestly trying to express the addictive hold D1 had on me and not expecting this to blow up haha, so I appreciate all of your comments! I'm not sure if I should be surprised by how many other people are also saying similar things, all along the lines of constantly playing D1 and missing out on other games, etc. because it was so fantastic.

I appreciate all of your stories and especially the person who guilded me as well! I'm sure that within the next 6 years left of Bungie's 10 year Destiny plan, we'll get something extraordinary that will once again throw us right in front of the TV for hours upon hours upon hours. ***Let us pour all of our remaining salt into this thread and move on together so that we may all wait peacefully for the next great game to return. In the mean time, enjoy as many other games as you can, people!! Why? Because if Bungie manages to excel and creates another fantastic Destiny.... Well, then I better make damn sure I'm graduated by then and have a job hahaha. Eyes up, Guardians!***

Destiny's Armor Design at its Finest,6318,crm4y7,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/crm4y7/destinys_armor_design_at_its_finest/,537,1566077406.0,"It’s no secret that the art direction for Destiny 2, particularly armour design, was disappointing for a lot of people. The consensus seems to be that armour pieces had cheap, plastic-y textures and over-stylised, impractical shapes.

*But* there are still designs Bungie are *really* good at, and explaining what works can set a precedent for what Destiny 'should look like' going forward.

Up until Destiny 2 Bungie mainly focused on **used future** with some **space western** and **science fantasy** elements, which I think works best for the setting both on a visual and thematic level.

&#x200B;

""Used future"" is a setting set in the future where the spaceships, robots, and everything else looks as though it has gone through wear and tear over the years. There is obviously a sliding scale but on some level designs are generally practical and utilitarian, things get weathered, fabrics tear and paint gets chipped.

[Used Future Example 1](https://www.destiny-infobase.de/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2015/04/Destiny-3-bild.jpg)

^(Like so - armor looks durable, fabrics are tattered, outfits have utilities and armor paint is slightly chipped)

This style grounds your setting in a sense of grit and realism, and breathes life into it - contrastingly, when everything looks brand new it can come off as static and lifeless. Tonally, it also works a lot better for stories in a post-apocalyptic setting where civilisation has all but collapsed and humanity has been hunted down and cower behind a single walled city.

&#x200B;

Then there’s the space western influences. I think everyone instinctively know what ‘western’ looks like in Destiny, but think Tex Mechanica, Icarus Drifter, Duster of Cormorant and the Intrepid sets.

[Space Western Example 1](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DfgfQRRUcAA-Lgb.jpg:large)

*^(Concept art for the Gambit sets - the western influences are a bit downplayed in the in-game models but c'est la vie)*

Since both used future and space westerns are very much defined by their pragmatism and grit it creates a very effective visual synergy. There’s going to be a lot of scuffed leather and weathered steel in both cases, so one doesn’t look out of place next to the other. The western style also works on a thematic level since the solar system has turned into a sort of wild frontier.

&#x200B;

Finally there’s the science-fantasy aesthetic. Fantasy as a visual genre is pretty much non-existent so more specifically - as with most fantasy - Destiny falls under historical fantasy.

[Science Fantasy Example 1](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/69/72/2e/69722eb2b35c9d5e9227c367fce6ee12.jpg)

[Science Fantasy Example 2](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/1280x868/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Ferikkain%2Ffiles%2F2015%2F10%2FIron-Banner-Trials-of-Osiris.jpg)

*^(The norse / medieval aesthetic has the same opportunity for gritty realism as westerns)*

The association with a historic period can *really* heighten the design, and since the medieval and norse aesthetics tend towards a very rugged look it maintains that visual synergy. On a thematic level it also communicates Destiny’s grand romantic elements very well.

However, it’s important to note that the historical period is just a theme - it shouldn’t dictate the design *too much*, nor undermine the science-fiction-y look.

&#x200B;

So yeah! That’s my take on which art styles Bungie should focus on. I tried my best to rationalize why the designs work for me, but my overall point is that visuals will inform the tone. If you stray too far from the established look it can cause a sort of tonal whiplash.

Though I’m obviously biased so feel free to share alternative takes.

&#x200B;

Edit: To clarify I think the rugged sci-fi look should be a baseline - with some space western and science fantasy sets inserted where it would makes sense. The branching-off point could then come from more unusual sources, not everything has to follow this formula.",2019-08-18 05:30:06
