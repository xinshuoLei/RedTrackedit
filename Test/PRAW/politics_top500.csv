"Hi, I'm Stacey Abrams. If I win my ""toss up"" Georgia gubernatorial race, I'll be the first Black woman governor in America. Ask Me Anything!",62739,9nmrxh,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/9nmrxh/hi_im_stacey_abrams_if_i_win_my_toss_up_georgia/,3057,1539397619.0,"Hi, I'm Stacey Abrams. I'm a tax attorney by trade, a serial entrepreneur, an award-winning author, and the former Democratic Minority Leader in the Georgia House. I am running for governor to build a Georgia where every family has the freedom and opportunity to thrive. If voters put their faith in me, I will be the first Black woman governor in U.S. history. 
 
I like to say I'm Mississippi-raised but Georgia grown. I grew up in a big family (3 sisters, 2 brothers), and we moved to Georgia when both of my parents were called to ministry. I'm a proud alumna of Avondale High School in Dekalb, Spelman College, UT Austin, and Yale Law School. 
 
I believe that poverty is immoral and economically inefficient, and I believe we can use policy to end it. That's why I first ran for public office in 2006, and why I founded an organization to combat voter suppression and help eligible people of color register to vote in Georgia.
 
As the first woman to lead either party in the General Assembly and the first Black person to lead in the House, I worked to elect Democrats and prevent a Republican supermajority. I also stopped legislation to raise taxes on the poor and middle class and to roll back reproductive health care, and worked across the aisle to save the HOPE scholarship. 
 
I will continue that work as governor: Expand Medicaid for 500,000 Georgians, support educational opportunities for every Georgian, and support small businesses to build a thriving economy in all 159 counties.
 
Under the pen name Selena Montgomery, I've written 8 romantic suspense novels and (shameless plug) released my first non-fiction book (Minority Leader: How To Lead From the Outside and Make Real Change) earlier this year. 
 
I'll admit: I'm a pop culture junkie. I watch a lot of TV (right now: Supernatural, The Good Place, Living Single reruns, Leverage), I'm a big fan of Buffy and Star Trek (especially Voyager and TNG), and I'm a voracious reader (Colson Whitehead, Haruki Murakami, Nora Roberts, tax policy, and more).
 
I’m excited to answer your questions, and I’ll be around for about an hour starting at 3:20 PM. Ask me anything!

Mueller III will testify to Congress in open session next month about his investigation of Russia's interference in the 2016 election and possible obstruction of justice by President Trump.

The House Judiciary and Intelligence committees, in a late-night announcement Tuesday, said that 'pursuant to a subpoena' Mueller has agreed to appear before both panels on July 17.

'Americans have demanded to hear directly from the special counsel so they can understand what he and his team examined, uncovered, and determined about Russia's attack on our democracy, the Trump campaign's acceptance and use of that help, and President Trump and his associates' obstruction of the investigation into that attack,'' said House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) in a statement. ''We look forward to hearing his testimony, as do all Americans.''

Megathread: California governor signs bill requiring presidential candidates release tax returns to appear on ballot,56949,cjwwf5,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/cjwwf5/megathread_california_governor_signs_bill/,15063,1564544391.0,"California’s Democratic governor signed a law Tuesday requiring presidential candidates to release their tax returns to appear on the state’s primary ballot, a move aimed squarely at Republican President Donald Trump.
But even if the law withstands a likely legal challenge, Trump could avoid the requirements by choosing not to compete in California’s primary. With no credible GOP challenger at this point, he likely won’t need California’s delegates to win the Republican nomination.

>Federal prosecutors in Manhattan obtained the search warrant after receiving a referral from the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, according to Mr. Cohen’s lawyer, who called the search “completely inappropriate and unnecessary.” The search does not appear to be directly related to Mr. Mueller’s investigation, but likely resulted from information he had uncovered and gave to prosecutors in New York.

Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, called Epstein's suicide an 'impossibility' that needed further congressional investigation.

'When an impossibility occurs involving powerful people and possible criminality there must be an investigation to end speculation,' Green wrote. 'Because the public has a right to know, I’m calling for a congressional investigation.'

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., voiced concern about Epstein's death.

'We need answers. Lots of them,' she wrote on Twitter. She then retweeted a post from former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti, in which Mariotti says that the criminal probe into Epstein would conclude because 'no one else was charged in the indictment.'

Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., called on the Bureau of Prisons to 'provide answers on what systemic failures of the MCC Manhattan or criminal acts allowed this coward to deny justice to his victims.'

Attorney General William Barr on Saturday decried the death of wealthy financier Jeffrey Epstein in federal custody while he awaited charges on sex trafficking, saying the apparent suicide 'raises serious questions.'

'I was appalled to learn that Jeffrey Epstein was found dead early this morning from an apparent suicide while in federal custody. Mr. Epstein’s death raises serious questions that must be answered,' Barr said in a statement.

'In addition to the FBI’s investigation, I have consulted with the Inspector General who is opening an investigation into the circumstances of Mr. Epstein’s death,' Barr added.

Megathread: Michael Cohen claims Trump knew in advance of 2016 Trump Tower meeting,52239,9289mr,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/9289mr/megathread_michael_cohen_claims_trump_knew_in/,9517,1532683973.0,"Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump's former personal attorney, claims that then-candidate Trump knew in advance about the June 2016 meeting in Trump Tower in which Russians were expected to offer his campaign dirt on Hillary Clinton, sources with knowledge tell CNN. Cohen is willing to make that assertion to special counsel Robert Mueller, the sources said.

Cohen's claim would contradict repeated denials by Trump, Donald Trump Jr., their lawyers and other administration officials who have said that the President knew nothing about the Trump Tower meeting until he was approached about it by The New York Times in July 2017.Cohen alleges that he was present, along with several others, when Trump was informed of the Russians' offer by Trump Jr. By Cohen's account, Trump approved going ahead with the meeting with the Russians, according to sources.

"Mega Thread: Unsealed Michael Cohen documents reportedly implicate Trump, Hicks, others in 'hush-money' payments",48717,ceuxd1,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ceuxd1/mega_thread_unsealed_michael_cohen_documents/,11092,1563497057.0,"Court documents related to hush money payments arranged by President Donald Trump’s former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen were filed unsealed Thursday.

The documents include a description of an Oct. 8, 2016, phone call Cohen received from Trump’s campaign communications chief Hope Hicks, during which 'Trump joined the call,' which federal investigators believed was related to an effort to keep porn star Stormy Daniels from going public with her claims of having had sex with Trump a decade earlier.

Hicks was interviewed by the FBI about the phone calls with Cohen, the documents indicate.

The filing by federal prosecutors in New York came a day after the judge in Cohen’s criminal case ordered their release, saying that the end of a probe into those payments meant they should be made public.

''So interesting to see 'Progressive' Democrat Congresswomen, who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world (if they even have a functioning government at all), now loudly and viciously telling the people of the United States, the greatest and most powerful Nation on earth, how our government is to be run,'' Trump said in an early morning string of tweets.
