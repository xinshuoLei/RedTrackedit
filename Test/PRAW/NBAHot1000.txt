"[OC] A look back at previous ""Most Improved Player"" winners and what it may tell us about the most likely candidates this year",236,dne8c0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dne8c0/oc_a_look_back_at_previous_most_improved_player/,58,1572127269.0,"
After going back through the list of ""Most Improved Player"" award winners from the 2000s, there's no clear and consensus template to victory. 
 
Certainly, the easiest path to win the award would be to blow up your scoring overnight. Some examples of that would include Zach Randolph who won in 2004 after going from 8.4 PPG to 20.1 (+11.7). Monta Ellis won a few years later by ballooning from 6.8 to 16.5 (+9.7). More recently, C.J. McCollum won in his breakout year after going from 6.8 PPG all the way up to 20.8 (+14.0). In all three cases, the improvement also came from a huge swell in ""minutes played."" Randolph and McCollum both doubled their minutes, for example.
 
However, that's not always the case. In certain instances, the trophy goes to improvement in scoring and efficiency more than playing time. In fact, Danny Granger won in 2009 despite playing only 0.2 more minutes per game. Jimmy Butler won in 2015 with the exact same minutes played (38.7 to 38.7). However, both Granger and Butler did improve their scoring that season (+6.2 and +6.9, respectively.)
 
If you want to scroll through the entire list of winnings of the 2000s, here are the numbers and their improvements. For the ""year,"" we're listing the year the trophy was handed out. For ""age,"" we're using basketball-reference numbers which judges by midseason age.

Clearly there are different versions and pathways forward to win. Most often, we see players win around their 3rd or 4th season, but that's not always the case. At times, it takes a new team and new role to jumpstart your candidacy. Other times, it's that first breakout year when a good player takes the next jump and gets his first All-Star appearance.
 
If you take the AVERAGE for each of these seasons, you'd get the following most improved player.
 
**Mr. Most Improved (average from 2000-2019)**
 
*age*: 23.7 years old, season 4.0 in NBA
 
*before*: 27.1 minutes, 11.7 PPG
 
*after*: 36.0 minutes, 19.6 PPG
 
Clearly, a big number in ""minutes"" and ""points"" is the crucial calling card. And since we're looking for players who can jump about +7 or +8 points, the idea of eyeing current players in the 11-12 range last season makes sense. If we also look for players in the typical age range (23-24, season 4), that could narrow our search.
 
So if we look for someone who fits this profile, which players come to mind?

######**candidates that fit our profile**
 
**Jaylen Brown, Boston**: Based on pure numbers, Jaylen Brown fits our average ""Mr. Most Improved"" nearly to a T. He's 23 years old, and entering Season 4. His previous numbers (25.9 minutes, 13.0 PPG) are also nearly identical to our average. The main concern for Brown's candidacy would be opportunity. Will the Celtics have enough minutes to play Brown 33-34 per game? That's going to be the hardest aspect for him, unless the team commits to a super smallball approach.
 
**Fred VanVleet, Toronto**: After his huge opening night performance, we already heard some FVV ""Most Improved"" buzz, and he fits our criteria well even before that. He's 25, also entering Season 4 (the magic number.) Even more so than Jaylen Brown, the opportunity for extended minutes (27.5 last year) and extended points (11.0 PPG) is absolutely there for the taking. I don't know if VanVleet has the type of mentality to push his average up into the 18 PPG range, but if it's required to help the team win, he may be capable. Oddly enough, teammate Pascal Siakam also has a clear opportunity to improve by + 7 or + 8 PPG, although I’m not convinced voters will honor the same player twice in a row for this. 
 
**Justise Winslow, Miami**: On paper, Justise Winslow also fits neatly into the boxes we've laid out. He's 23, entering Year 5. His average from last season (12.6 PPG) should be easy to improve on as well. While Winslow already played a fair amount last year (29.7 minutes per game), his increased ballhandling and playmaking role may make his minutes more productive (statistically) and lead to a candidacy in the mold of his new teammate Jimmy Butler.
 
**Kelly Oubre, Phoenix**: Candidly, I'm not a huge fan of Kelly Oubre, but I have to admit he has an opportunity here. He'll be 24 for the majority of the season, and will be in Season 4. ""Opportunity"" shouldn't be an issue either. Now on Phoenix for the full year, he can absolutely improve on his 15.2 PPG average from last season, especially with Deandre Ayton suspended for a while. If the Suns rely more heavily on Oubre, he can threaten 18-20 PPG. Can he get into the 21-22 range he'd probably need to win this? Maybe.
 
**Malik Beasley, Denver**: In terms of talent and production, all Malik Beasley really needs is the opportunity that someone like Kelly Oubre has right now. Beasley's already a good scorer, hitting 11.3 PPG in 23.2 minutes a night (with 40.2% from three last season.) If he got to play 30-35 minutes, he could absolutely win this award in his Age 23, Season-4 campaign. The only thing blocking him would be the Denver depth; there's not a true pathway to those minutes right now barring an injury.


**Myles Turner, Indiana**: We tend to think of Myles Turner as an already-established star, but there's still room for improvement from a statistical standpoint for the 23 year old. Last season, the Pacers kept his minutes down (28.6 per game) and his scoring stagnated at 13.3. Perhaps he's simply not the type of player who's going to drive up his scoring given everything else he does. However, if he *wanted* to, he can absolutely threaten 20 PPG and make a case here. Teammate Domatas Sabonis may also have the same idea in mind.

######**candidates that nearly fit our profile**
 
**Jonathan Isaac, Orlando**: Still only 22 years old and entering Season 3, Isaac's candidacy may be a season premature. Still, you love the opportunity here. After a modest 9.6 PPG last season, Isaac has the chance to get the +7 or +8 he would need to qualify for some votes if he shows more of an aggressive approach on offense this year.

**Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Oklahoma City**: Only entering Year 2, it would be quite early for SGA to win Most Improved. However, it has happened for a few year 2 players before so we can’t rule it out. On a new team, he’s going to have an extended opportunity to score, especially if the team starts shipping out their vets. 
 
**Markelle Fultz, Orlando**: Based on the template we've laid out, Markelle Fultz doesn't qualify as a likely candidate because he's not even productive enough for our ""before"" campaign (8.2 PPG, 22.5 minutes last year.) Still, that low bar may help him even more in the event that the Magic unleash him for 30 minutes a night and allow him to get up to that 15 PPG range. In fact, he may be one of the most likely candidates all things considered.",236

Granted, he has done his role and facilitated and whatnot, but the shooting percentage is pretty surprising. I am not freaking out or anything though, he will be fine. 

I found it surprising that people really thought Lebron is washed. He isn’t, and it’s silly to think that. Hot takes are hot takes I guess.

Biggest surprise is Kyrie Irving to me though. He is playing great and looks happy with the Nets. I didn’t expect him to kill it so quickly. Good for him.

Josh Jackson was the #1 recruit out of high school. his coach held practices to only 50 minutes and his trainers restricted him from jumping to reduce risk of injury.,907,dn4u4w,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dn4u4w/josh_jackson_was_the_1_recruit_out_of_high_school/,124,1572070919.0," There was this ESPN article about injury epidemic among young players.

&#x200B;

 [https://www.espn.com/nba/story/\_/id/27148543/under-knife-exposing-america-youth-basketball-crisis](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/27148543/under-knife-exposing-america-youth-basketball-crisis) 

\>Russotti, co-founder of a prep basketball program that trains elite athletes, majored in kinesiology at Sonoma State -- and loves basketball. And after 14 years teaching middle school physical education, then working as a skills trainer/strength and conditioning coach for youth players, Russotti married his two loves at Prolific Prep, a program in Napa, California, that partners with Napa Christian, a private school. In 2014, with backing from Adidas, Russotti helped found that program in part because of issues that he saw around the youth landscape, where he says players were too often exhausted by marathon schedules, didn't receive proper training and saw promising careers be cut short because of it.

>**""\[Basketball\] is all he does. He doesn't have time for anything else.""**Sharonda Sampson, Zion Williamson's mom, in May 2017, before his senior year of high school

He vowed to do better: He would hold shorter practices -- not two hours a day, five days a week, as it was when he went to high school, but just 50 minutes a day, total. He also wanted to limit the number of tournaments and games that his players would play in, even if it meant taking heat from tournament directors, which he says happened when they sat one of their players, a future NBA lottery pick, for a dozen games during his senior year.

""We can see it in their body when they need a break,"" Russotti says. ""We don't want to be the reason why a kid gets hurt.""

**The player they sat in those games? That star was forward** [**Josh Jackson**](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066297/josh-jackson)**, who went on to play at Kansas and would become the fourth overall pick in the 2017 NBA draft. But to understand the depth of Prolific Prep's concern for player health, consider what Jackson heard when he'd practice acrobatic dunks:**

**""You just lost $1,000,"" Jackson was told. ""You just threw it away from your future."" Staffers would explain to him how leaping and landing impart a violent force on a player's knees, and that if he wanted to get the most out of those knees, he should save those jumps until it really mattered. If Jackson jumped 10 times in a day, they'd tell him he lost $10,000. If he jumped 100 times that month, they'd say he cost himself $100,000. They'd tell him he was well on his way to losing millions and millions, just on jumping alone.**

Such thinking sounds radical, Russotti admits. ""The AAU coaches and the parents, we get it all the time: 'Why isn't he working out? Why is he doing this? Why are you giving him time off? No pain, no gain.' That's the old philosophy. So we get that pressure, but we have to tell them, 'Understand. Just please let us do what we know.'""

The players, he says, don't buck against Prolific's methods. ""The kids get it,"" he says. ""They want a break. It's exhausting.

Did the 2004 Athens Olympics Contribute to Today’s NBA?,9,dnfbcl,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dnfbcl/did_the_2004_athens_olympics_contribute_to_todays/,5,1572132578.0,"Olympic basketball has always been a personal favorite and lately I have been on a YouTube journey catching old games from 1992 to 2016. 

In 2004, the USA basketball team, led by Tim Duncan and Allen Iverson, took home bronze in what at the time was a giant upset. The US had been on roll since the Dream Team and with NBA players in the mix we were always the favorite for Gold. In the 2000 Sydney Olympics the cracks were starting to show, a close win over Australia proved the gap was closing. Then 2002 FIBA, the US is manhandled and finish 6th.

In 2002 and 2004, it becomes clear the international game has changed. During both tournaments smaller, quick guards are penetrating the defense and kicking out to their three-point shooters. The US is still playing inside physical basketball and they are getting hurt by strong three-point shooting.

At the same time, Mike D’Antoni and the seven second or less Suns are mirroring that basketball and Steve Nash is on a two-year MVP run. D’Antoni has a lot of international experience as a player and coach and is incorporating this brand of basketball into his team that at the time was making a serious run against the then dominant Spurs and Mavericks teams.

So much of the 2002 & 2004 basketball looks similar to the NBA of today. Smaller, faster guards and tons of three-point shots. Really interesting to see how US basketball effected international play, and then international play really influenced the current NBA, in my opinion at least.

As a side note, if you have 45 minutes to spare I suggest catching the 2008 Gold medal game between the US and Spain. The Redeem Team wins a close victory against a amazing Spanish team and its an all-around exciting games with a lot of stars on both sides playing amazing basketball.",9

This past season, Pascal Siakam emerged as the champion Raptors' second-best player at times, while being paid in the 12th percentile of all NBA players. Stephen Curry's ankle issues led him to be famously underpaid during his MVP seasons and set the stage for his Warriors' mid-2010s dominance. You could make a convincing argument that LeBron James has been worth far more than his max contract for his on-court contributions alone.

&nbsp;

On the flip side, bloated contracts given to underperforming stars or even middling role players can severely restrict the flexibility and ultimately the success of their teams. All Wolves' owner Glen Taylor needed to see from Andrew Wiggins before handing him a max contract was a handful of subpar chucking seasons and an (unfulfilled) [promise that he would improve](https://sports.yahoo.com/timberwolves-just-want-andrew-wiggins-promise-hell-get-better-200047839.html). Wiggins' ill-advised contract contributed to the downfall of the Wolves' short-lived return to relevance in 2018, and may eventually cost them the opportunity to retain Karl-Anthony Towns.

&nbsp;

I mean, this a pretty straightforward concept - acquire high-value players and avoid having overpaid players on the roster. But is there anything more to this strategy that we can uncover? Are there certain types of players that tend to exist under the radar? What exactly constitutes a ""high-value"" player?

#Salary Scores and VORP Scores

My working definition of value is production in relation to salary. For two players with a given level of production, the player who is paid less than the other has more value. But how should we measure salary and production?

In order to form an effective basis for comparison across seasons, we need to scale salaries relative to each season. Otherwise a max contract from a decade ago would look like insane value compared to a similar size contract today. Case in point: Kobe Bryant in 2005 made $14.1 million. A similar salary today would net you players like Kelly Oubre, Marvin Williams, or Eric Gordon.

In addition to salary, we need a production metric. I chose VORP for the job given that it has a decent reputation as advanced metrics go and is widely available in Basketball Reference for the scope of this study. Because VORP is calculated to be era-independent, I scaled VORP relative to all seasons (2003-2019).

To compute both Salary Score and VORP Score, I rescaled the original variables such that the means have a value of 0 and the standard deviations have a value of 1.

I went as far back as 2003, when the NBA introduced the modern salary cap and luxury tax system that remains in place today. Before 2003 you had contracts exceeding the entire cap - but with different luxury tax incentives, teams and players behaved differently. 

&nbsp;

So with these rescaled tools, we can plot all players from 2003-2019 on [one chart](https://i.imgur.com/75AvJmx.png).

&nbsp;

We can begin to tease out an idea of value from this chart: remember that a positive Salary Score represents a salary above league average for that season, while a positive VORP Score represents a VORP above league average for the entirety of the 2003-2019 seasons. Thus, a player with a positive salary score and a negative VORP score can be identified as having poor value, and the opposite for a player with great value.

It gets a little murkier around the middle portion of the plot, where salary score and VORP score are similar. Just how valuable is a player that is paid highly yet falls slightly short in terms of production? How about a player that is paid slightly above average but produces well above average? There exists a delicate balance between the value of cap space and the rarity of big-time contributors - where exactly does the equilibrium fall?

A great many players are scrunched into that bottom left corner - that means they're below average in both salary and production. These players aren't difference makers on the court, nor on the team's books, so their value doesn't move the needle.

So we visually laid out players in a way that we can tease out some assumptions about value. But we need to more explicitly define this idea of *value*.

#Adding a Value Gradient

The tricky part in defining value is finding the balance in valuing production as magnitude of contract increases. The value of VORP does not progress at a one-to-one rate with salary - higher production players are increasingly rare and should be compensated accordingly. A player with a VORP of 5.0 should be worth more than two players each with a VORP of 2.5.

At the same time, cap space itself is highly valued, and a player taking up large amounts of cap room while not living up to their contract acts as a deadweight to a team that is now severely handicapped in building out the rest of the roster.

To come up with my Value Score, I created an expected salary for each player based on their VORP for that season. Then I subtracted the player's actual salary from their expected salary to get the first component of the Value Score. Then, in order to account for the rarity of higher production players, I added VORP Score as a second component to the Value Score. The end result, besides the ability to quantifiably rank player value, is [this value gradient](https://i.imgur.com/z5HnHXa.png).

&nbsp;

The diagonal line represents the ""break-even curve"" where value score is calculated to be zero - players above and to the left are of below-average value, and players below and to the right of the curve are of above-average value.

The graph above confirms our intuitions about where the high and low value players reside, also giving us some clarity in the murky middle region of the graph.

Time to put it to use!

#Which Player is the Most Undervalued?

**Here are the top 20 most undervalued player seasons since 2003:**

|player|season|age|season number|team|sal|vorp|value score|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|Chris Paul|2009|23|4|NOH|$4.6m|10|8.29|

|Stephen Curry|2015|26|6|GSW|$10.6m|7.9|5.45|
|Brandon Roy|2009|24|3|POR|$3.1m|5.7|5.36|

&nbsp;

11 out of the 20 seasons are from budding young stars still on their rookie contracts. Andrei Kirilenko was an absolute beast in 2004, finishing second in VORP while earning a meager million. 

The non-rookie contract seasons come from: LeBron James - no further explanation needed; Steph Curry - whose aforementioned ankle issues suppressed his value until he blossomed into an all-time great; and a handful of superstars at the absolute peak of their game - 2003 McGrady, 2005 Garnett, and 2009 Wade. 

&nbsp;

**Top 20 most overvalued seasons since 2003:**

|Jalen Rose|2006|33|12|TOT|$15.7m|-0.3|-4.42|
|Jermaine O'Neal|2008|29|12|IND|$19.7m|0.0|-4.4|
|Jermaine O'Neal|2010|31|14|MIA|$23.0m|1.0|-4.39|
|Shaquille O'Neal|2007|34|15|MIA|$20.0m|0.8|-4.34|
|Shaquille O'Neal|2010|37|18|CLE|$20.0m|0.5|-4.16|
|Carlos Boozer|2014|32|12|CHI|$15.3m|-0.7|-4.14|
|Stephon Marbury|2008|30|12|NYK|$19m|0.1|-4.13|
|Jermaine O'Neal|2009|30|13|TOT|$21.4m|0.5|-4.12|

|Keith Van Horn|2006|30|9|DAL|$15.7m|0.1|-4.04|

&nbsp;

The tail end of the value spectrum is populated almost exclusively by aging stars struggling with injury and ineffectiveness while still being paid handsomely  - 17 out of the 20 players listed here are in their 10th season or later. Derrick Rose's third comeback effort in as many seasons (after as many knee surgeries...) makes the cut. And then you have... Andrew Wiggins.

[Here is a visualization of the above tables](https://i.imgur.com/v7ScZZO.png), overlayed onto the value gradient.

&nbsp;

For a more recent flavor, let's take a look at the **most undervalued players from this past season (2019):**

|player|age|season number|team|sal|vorp|value score|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|Karl-Anthony Towns|23|4|MIN|$7.8m|5.7|4.82|
|James Harden|29|10|HOU|$30.4m|9.9|4.72|
|Giannis Antetokounmpo|24|6|MIL|$24.2m|7.6|4.13|
|Nikola Jokic|23|4|DEN|$24.6m|7.3|3.83|
|Nikola Vucevic|28|8|ORL|$12.8m|5.3|3.7|
|Pascal Siakam|24|3|TOR|$1.5m|3.5|3.48|
|Ben Simmons|22|2|PHI|$6.4m|4.1|3.4|
|Luka Doncic|19|1|DAL|$6.6m|3.6|2.85|
|Rudy Gobert|26|6|UTA|$23.2m|5.9|2.75|
|Montrezl Harrell|25|4|LAC|$6.0m|3.4|2.73|


&nbsp;

Again - 4 out of 10 players still on their rookie contracts. The rest? Giannis and Harden finished 1st and 2nd in MVP voting, respectfully; Vucevic had a career year on a very team-friendly salary; and Gobert's fourth-place finish in VORP lives up to his lofty salary, a scenario that Value Score (ahem) values highly.

Nikola Jokic, despite being in his fourth year, was not on his rookie deal due to the fact that he was a second-round pick. Second-rounders aren't subject to the same salary structure as first-rounders. He is still totally worth every dollar of that contract though.

&nbsp;

**And now for underperformers in 2019:**

|player|age|season number|team|sal|vorp|value score|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|Andrew Wiggins|23|5|MIN|$25.5m|-0.6|-4.12|
|Harrison Barnes|26|7|DAL/SAC|$24.1m|-0.2|-3.58|
|Gordon Hayward|28|8|BOS|$31.2m|1.2|-3.28|
|Jabari Parker|23|5|CHI/WAS|$20.0m|0.0|-2.79|
|Jeff Teague|30|10|MIN|$19.0m|-0.1|-2.73|
|Otto Porter|25|6|WAS/CHI|$26.0m|1.0|-2.71|
|Chris Paul|33|14|HOU|$35.7m|2.4|-2.69|
|Dennis Schroder|25|6|OKC|$15.5m|-0.6|-2.66|
|Allen Crabbe|26|6|BRK|$18.5m|-0.1|-2.65|
|Kent Bazemore|29|7|ATL|$18.1m|-0.1|-2.59|

&nbsp;

Would you look at that - Wiggins takes the cake for most overvalued player of the 2018-19 season. And on the other end of the spectrum? His teammate, Karl-Anthony Towns. 

[For your visual reference:](https://i.imgur.com/Bel2GVx.png)

&nbsp;

[Here's a link to the full value dataset.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1szjxw6ZJYjsIKnddoDmr-_bRAZFt6gz1/view?usp=sharing)

There seems to be a trend we're noticing here, which leads us to...

#The Value of Rookie Contracts

The NBA introduced rookie scale contracts in 1995 in response to the growing number of absurdly large deals given to young, unproven rookies. The structure of these rookie contracts allows teams to retain their first-rounders for up to 4 seasons at a predetermined rate depending on their draft position.

Given the amount of uncertainty involved with projecting future success at such a young age, the structure makes a lot of sense. For the rookies, it represents guaranteed money upon being drafted, their first taste of (monetary) success. But for the standouts - those who enter the league as positive contributors, or become one after a season or two - this contract structure serves to artificially depress their salary, and thus lead to incredible value for their team. 

[Check out this visual](https://i.imgur.com/Tzz8gK8.png) which charts player salary against season number.

&nbsp;

As the graphic above depicts, players in their first 4 seasons are vastly over-represented in the lower 50 percentile of salaries, which immediately shifts from season 5 on, when many rookie-scale contracts end. But does player production follow a similar progression?

&nbsp;

[Not at all.](https://i.imgur.com/0ZjQuWg.png) By their third seasons, players' VORPs start to closely resemble those of more experienced players. This means that some of the most valuable contracts in the league, on a season-by-season basis, tend to be players in their third or fourth seasons. 


[This graphic](https://i.imgur.com/nvr2455.png) charts Salary Score by VORP Score, but separates players' seasons by season number.

&nbsp;

[Here's all of them squashed into one graph](https://i.imgur.com/pEsDpIL.png) for a different look. Blue points represent players in their first four seasons, while red points denote players in their fifth seasons and on.

Note the solid value growth throughout the first four seasons, underscored by the dramatic shift from season four to season five.

As an aside: The goal here is not to uncover some hidden strategy - it's no secret that players who develop into positive contributors while still on their rookie-scale contracts get the most bang for their buck. Nevertheless, I think visualizing the scope of their value in comparison to more experienced players is pretty striking. 

#Bottom Line: Young Players Who Pan Out are Insanely Valuable.

...Until they sign their second contract, that is. Teams that hold the rights to the player hold a distinct advantage over others when it comes to retaining that player in terms of total salary and years offered. Valuing that contract, however, is especially tricky, as teams have to take into account future growth and injury risk, evaluate the player's fit and role within the team, and fight off other potential suitors. But before they sign that second contract...

&nbsp;

Their value multiplies two-fold when you consider the cap flexibility retained by the team. Not only does the team reap the benefits of outsized productivity from a young, underpaid player, but they also maintain the wiggle room to acquire and keep additional talent.

&nbsp;

If team like the Sixers manages to acquire a Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons, two star-level players still on their rookie contracts, it leaves them with ample cap space to sign another star in Horford and put together a cast of high-level supporting players. The Sixers may face a troubling cap scenario when Embiid and Simmons' extensions both kick in, but for now they remain one of the favorites to come out of the East.

&nbsp;

These results only magnify the importance of identifying and acquiring young talent. If a team can create a competitive advantage through the draft and hit on more draft picks than average, they can reap the benefits of their inflated value. Easier said than done, of course, but teams like the San Antonio Spurs have shown a consistent edge in finding talented young players later in the draft, which is a large component of their continued success.

#Next Steps

I ran into a few problems during the course of this project that need a little working around. Only players with over 800 minutes played on the season are included in the dataset, which leaves out some players on albatross contracts that sat out the entire season (Chandler Parsons comes to mind, also John Wall for this upcoming season) and the exclusion of which could skew the data.

&nbsp;

Leaving out such players also distorts the uncertainty of relying on young, unproven kids. One assumed advantage of signing experienced players is that they are more of a known commodity, and that lesser risk factors into their monetary value. Expecting a draft pick to be a positive contributor out the gate for a world-class, professional sports team may be asking a little too much of a 19-year-old who would otherwise be in his sophomore year of college. Nevertheless, some players figure it out much quicker than others, some peak early and fizzle out, some never figure it out at all - the point is that you just don't know, and it's incredibly difficult to predict.

For these reasons, I plan to replicate this project including all players with no minutes cutoff.

&nbsp;

There is also much more nuance in team-specific situations than this study suggests. Each team is on their own timeline in terms of competing, player development, owner outlook, market situation, and overall direction that is almost entirely overlooked here. Sometimes teams are forced to overpay key players or risk letting them walk for nothing in free agency. The free agent market often boils down to a take-what-you-can-get scenario for many teams - acquiring a certain player may be viewed as an overpay by the numbers and from the lens of outside observers, but in actuality represents a necessary step for a team to continue to improve.

&nbsp;

Contracts also don't exist in a seasonal vacuum, and represent more than just compensation for on-court production. Teams may be willing to overpay aging stars in order to contend in the present (eg. Chris Paul and the Rockets). Expiring contracts represent strategic, roster-building value distinct from the on-court production of the players to which they are attached. The magnitude of contracts reflects the state of the free agency market around the time of the signing; weak markets lead to a negative feedback loop and overpaying players, as [John Hollinger points out in his Athletic article](https://theathletic.com/1312762/2019/10/22/hollinger-how-next-summers-weak-free-agency-class-impacted-nba-contract-extension-deadline/).

&nbsp;

The way in which we perceive contract value is flawed, too. Postseason success is too often the focal point through which we judge front office and coaching decisions, which may serve to create a revisionist timeline more often than not. While signing a player can be seen as a safe gamble at the time, perception of the deal can quickly sour if that roll of the dice turns out unfavorably due to injury or other misfortune.

&nbsp;

However, the goal was never to come up with an approach that accounts for all of the above and churns out a one-size-fits-all solution. The objective, rather, is much less ambitious. It is simply to add another tool to our belt - one that helps us shine more light on a specific component of the problem, that we can use in conjunction with other contextual clues to evaluate each situation. The results of this project provide a quantifiable addition to any discussion about a player's value.

#Which Teams Capitalize Most on this Value?

Earlier I touched on the importance of acquiring underpaid talent, given its extraordinary value. An interesting next step would be to look at the teams who have excelled in this department and whether they've employed any unique strategies in doing so.

&nbsp;

Front offices have many avenues through which to improve their rosters, whether it be through the draft, free agency, trades, or internal development. Teams located in larger, more attractive markets can lean on free agency as a bigger tool in roster building, whereas other teams must survive through calculated trades and developing their own talent. The latter category includes teams like the Spurs, Nets, Blazers and Heat which have relied on building a strong culture of professionalism and player development. More on that to come!",204

He's exactly the sort of explosive scoring/playmaking guard that MVP voters have given 3 out of the last 4 awards to. The Hawks won't be good enough this season but in the East it's definitely possible that they could put up 50+ wins within a few years.  

Trae is just such a dynamic scorer. He can whip by you to the rim, he can bomb from the logo, he gets to the line well. He's also already a better passer than someone like Curry. I think he will eventually be the best offensive player in the league.   

If I had to put money on it, I'd bet that over their first 5 seasons Luka will contribute more to winning but Trae will win more individual accolades. The benefit of playing in the East.

[OC] Overreactions from all the games in round one of 2019-20 NBA regular season,460,dmwd9u,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dmwd9u/oc_overreactions_from_all_the_games_in_round_one/,178,1572033269.0,"We're 3 days into the new season, and every team had played atleast one game so far.

Jaylen Brown is the next Andrew Wiggins

Is there anyone in the league right now that could surpass Tim Duncan's defensive accolades?,28,dn834t,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dn834t/is_there_anyone_in_the_league_right_now_that/,38,1572087175.0,"Tim Duncan is one of the best players to ever fundamentally pick up a basketball. He was so good that he ended up with more individual and team accomplishments than Kobe ""The Black Mamba"" Bryant.^Tim^Duncan^is^better. I think a part of his game that NBA fans overlook is his defensive dominance only because he never won a Defensive Player of the year award. In my opinion, Tim Duncan is between the 3rd or 4th best defensive player of all time.

**Tim Duncan's Defensive Metrics:**

- Defensive Rating         95.6 [(3rd All-Time)](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/def_rtg_career.html#tot::none)

- Rebounds                   15091 [(6th All-Time)](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/trb_career.html)

- Blocks                        3020 [(5th All-Time)](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/blk_career.html)

- Defensive Win Shares  106.3 [(2nd All-Time)](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/dws_career.html)

- Defensive Box Plus-Minus 4.02 [(5th All-Time)](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/dbpm_career.html)

**Nearly Unbreakable records:**

- Most Blocks in Postseason History 568 [(1st All-Time)](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/blk_career_p.html) 
Something that I believe will never be broken. The next closest person is Kareem with 476 blocks.

- All-Defensive Team Selection        15 Selections Total [(1st All-Time)](https://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/all_defense_by_player.html) 
It should be almost impossible to break this record, because who will be able to play top-level defense for 16 years? Pretty much from the start to the end of their career.


Is there anyone in the NBA right now that you think could come close to this level of defensive dominance?",28

Naturally, I see this scenario going until the trade deadline, not ending anytime soon.

In the case he isn’t waived, what are some trades that you’d propose for a contending team to get  Andre in a trade working with the cap?

The only one I can see for the Lakers is Iguodala for KCP & Bradley. However, KCP needs to waive his NTC and I’d prefer to keep Bradley, so I wouldn’t make that deal.

At the moment, speculation is the top teams for his services would be the Lakers, Clippers, and Rockets, but all currently are of the mindset of picking him through a waiver.",1

Magic Johnson on Undisputed claims that Demps was fired because he wouldn't trade AD to the Lakers out of spite and it cost him his Job.,141,dn0hbd,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dn0hbd/magic_johnson_on_undisputed_claims_that_demps_was/,36,1572052281.0,"https://streamable.com/pgaiv

This is what he claims but it is totally false. AD was not traded to the Lakers midseason because soon as AD requested a trade Dell would be fired at the end of the season. The ownership also didn't want a trade to be done till a new GM was chosen. Other suitors were also limited in their offers until the offseason. It was a direct order from the ownership of the Pels to wait till the offseason to trade AD. It shows what everyone knew of the Lakers org that they live in their own bubble.

Russ has not had that type of accountability in years and maybe ever in the NBA. It looked like Harden was yelling at Russ for not moving to the right spots off-ball. Russ adjusted and ended up making some great cuts later in the game. And even after the game he said he needs to be better in terms of moving off-ball. I never saw Russ and PG having that type of discussion and Russ played the most boneheaded basketball of his prime next to PG.",58

A significant portion of this subreddit are posts about player statlines that become irrelevant the very next day,2,dnegm0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dnegm0/a_significant_portion_of_this_subreddit_are_posts/,35,1572128392.0,"Every night, in every nba game there are going to be players who put up impressive (or inpressively bad) statlines. This always leads to several threads everyday along the lines of ""wow! Amirite!?"" and not much else of substance.

Also, these posts about individual stats in a game become irrelevant because the next day will have more posts about statlines that take their place. These posts wouldn't be so bad if some people actually posted highlights of the performance, but most dont. It's just numbers associated with a player name and no context.

I'm pretty sure there are people on here that aren't even watching games but look at the boxscore only to farm upvotes for themselves with low effort material. I feel like this type of material belongs in a sub about fantasy basketball where contextless numbers actually matter and have some use.

Furthermore these posts about statlines without video or context just invites people to make vapid comments or give uninformed opinons about players and teams overall.

I dunno. Maybe i'm just a grouch but to me these threads are worse than the low effort highlight posts that people would make before the recent rule changes on the sub.

TLDR - A significant portion of this sub is about circle jerking over numbers from a single game that doesn't matter as soon as the next day of games are played. At least post highlights if you have nothing to say about the performance other than present numbers",2

Rule Question: You Cannot Secure and Attempt the Shot within the final second,4,dn9e6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dn9e6c/rule_question_you_cannot_secure_and_attempt_the/,17,1572094772.0,"Hey all, big fan of NBA basketball. This is one thing I hear from time to time that I don’t quite know the specifics about. 

My understanding is that whenever there is an inbound (dead ball type situation) and the shooter has less than a second to shoot before the end of the quarter or half, there is a certain rule the NBA has instituted relating to that. I have heard it referred to as “You cannot secure and attempt the shot” after a certain time within the second. (For example, 0.2 seconds) 

Here are my questions:
1. At what point does this rule kick in? 0.6? 0.7? I really don’t know.

2. What is the procedure for when there is a dead ball inbound that is beyond this limit? Do they just call the game/quarter/half as over? Does the team still have to inbound, but any shot attempt is immediately waved off by the ref?

3. Is this a reasonable rule? I’ve seen some guys be able to tip the ball (and even attempt the shot) in an incredibly short amount of time.  

4. I believe I heard this rule was implemented after the Los Angeles’ lakers defeated the Sacramento Kings back in the early 2000’s, you know, the infamous Derek Fisher shot where the Kings triple covered Kobe and Fisher was able to heave a shot in less than a second. Is this rule a direct response to that play?

Thanks for any insights. Sorry if that’s a lot. I’ve always been intrigued by this rule because I have seen some NBA players do some pretty amazing stuff with less than 0.5 on the clock.",4

As you already know, Harrell is much more like a small ball centre who often has success in setting a pick and rolling to the basket, while Kuzma has more success from shooting and driving in quickly and getting to the basket guard style

When I say bad I don’t mean in the sense that his decision making hurts the team but rather that he just has a complete inability to do anything offensively.  


Ps. For knicks fans who are gonna downvote this to oblivion, I really do root for frank and love his defense , I believe that if he could just make shots at even a slightly below average rate he will be a very solid player , but as a fan of the game I have to ask this out of curiosity.

This Rockets vs Bucks game was won by an intriguing coaching battle.,443,dmqyfd,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dmqyfd/this_rockets_vs_bucks_game_was_won_by_an/,55,1571999335.0,"In the fourth quarter Mike D'Antoni refused to play Capella in favour of a small lineup that could offer more floor spacing. The spacing obviously was set to allow Westbrook to drive to the hoop which he was doing incredibly, the Rockets are also a very good 3 point shooting team.   
  
However this was countered by Budenholzer who decided to take advantage of the short lineup by playing Lopez in the post. By running a low post play with Lopez, the big man from the Bucks was able to take advantage of his smaller opponent in PJ Tucker. He dished out some crucial assists by causing the Rockets to collapse in the paint where he would then kick it out to an open teammate for 3 (Middleton and Matthews). He also overpowered them and was able to take some strong shots close to the basket for crucial buckets.  
  
I hope you guys found this as interesting as i did because it was really cool to see.",443

>> This about $250-300 million more than the Knicks or Lakers, the next-highest NBA teams, and possibly more than even any NFL team, “except maybe the Cowboys,” one source said. Actually, in 2018, Forbes estimated that the Cowboys took in about $950 million in annual revenue, so the Warriors aren’t there.

>> But it’s still higher than any non-Cowboys NFL team (Forbes estimates that the Patriots are the next highest in the NFL, at $600 million in annual revenue), higher than the Yankees’ Forbes-estimated $668 million (No. 1 in MLB) and more than $400 million higher than Forbes’ estimate for the NBA average.

I think cp3 if he doesn't get traded has one good year left in him to score but his great basketball mind will stay the same, to help facilitate the offense 

I like Shai at the SG position. He has potential to have a breakout year next to CP3. Galo will give you 20 a game and Steven Adams is still a brick wall on defense


Where they truly hurt is their depth. Theyd need to stay healthy to compete, because outside of Schroeder their bench isn't looking hot. 


Many people think it's a wash cause they'll just trade cp3 anyway but who knows we didn't even think he would play a game in okc maybe they try and make a push

Getting Roberson back will boost their depth",4

Hey everyone - the NBA is back and this is my first video of the season. Unfortunately, it’s an injury to one of the most anticipated rookie phenoms in a minute - Zion Williamson. I took a detailed look at:

* The lateral meniscus tear injury
* The debridement surgery
* His return timeline
* Five potential underlying reasons:
   * Weight, activity fluctuations, biomechanics (landing, running, walking), risk/reward calculation, compensation
* Why a lateral meniscus tear, specifically, carries higher risk

For those at work or the hard of hearing, I've transcribed subtitles on YouTube so sound isn't required.

For reference, I'm a DPT with my own sports rehab & performance clinics in West LA and Valencia, CA. Feel free to hit me with questions or you can always find me @3cbperformance.

Who is the better player and who are you picking to be on your team for 1 year (assuming they’re healthy and stay that way). 

For reference, MJ was averaging somewhere around 20/5/5 with 1.5 steals during his time with the wizards. Butler averaged 18/5/4 on philly and 20/5/4 with the timberwolves. 

Defensively, I’m sure MJ was still giving people work but obviously age and athleticism have to go to Butler.

I am 22 Years Old coming from Northern Germany. I was always watching NBA and when I found out that there will be a Game in Europe I was so damn excited. I instantly signed up for Pre-Buying.

Then I even found out it will be a Bucks Game ( Giannis Fanboy here since 2 Years I think ). I knew it will be pretty hard to even get 1 Ticket or 2 I was prepared to pay a lot.

First Round Starts 23.10 I enter the queue and get placed 1800ish. -> Get no Tickets in not even one category.

So im like: "" it´s ok there will be another Sale maybe there just were not that much tickets"".

I also checked the usual Resellers where the Price of a ticket i wanted to buy for 85 Euro now Costs 440 !!!!!!!

So its Friday the official date of selling. I Enter The queue again and then I read it :

Places will be Randomly chosen. Of Course I get Spot 31000 so again no Tickets for me.

I am willing to pay like 300 Bucks for a Ticket but not to some Guy who just buys these tickets for resell.

So now I am at least not angry anymore just sad. :\`)

Potential trade if the dlo experiment doesn’t work for golden state,0,dng4du,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dng4du/potential_trade_if_the_dlo_experiment_doesnt_work/,59,1572136162.0,"If golden state has an underwhelming season and the dlo-curry fit doesn’t work out, I think this could be a trade that makes sense for both teams.

Orlando: Jonathan Issac, Evan Fournier, markelle fultz

Golden state: D’angelo Russell 

Now this is obviously assuming a couple things. 

First is fultz doesn’t prove himself as a capable starter. This is not me hating or rooting for the kid to fail. Fultz looks like a role player but if you watch him shoot, it’s still bad especially from 3. 

Second would be Issac takes a decent jump but not too big. I know Orlando is high on Issac but really he’s shown very little offensively. If he made a big jump offensively (which I don’t expect) Orlando wouldn’t do this. So it’d have to be slight improvement like more consistent from 3 mostly. 

Third is dlo and Steph don’t gel well and gs finishes as a low seed, first round exit or miss the playoffs. Steph and dlo have some very obvious fit issues. Defensively they project to be a disaster. And curry is also forced to play off ball when they are on the court together which isn’t maximizing his effectiveness. 

Fournier provides some much needed bench scoring for gs. He’d be in his last year of his contract. I don’t think Orlando would consider it a massive loss considering they reupped t ross for four more years.

For gs Issac is a very intriguing guy to trade for especially if dlo and curry prove to be a disaster defensively. By next year klay will be back and it’d be much more preferable to them if they can get back to running their normal Steph-klay-3 and d sf-dray-center. 

Issac would have to show a more consistent 3 for gs to wanna do this and continue his upward trend on the defensive side. Fournier is an asset especially for gs considering they have a bench full of g leaguers but he’s also an expiring next year so there’s not a lot of value there. Fultz’s skillset can be perfect for gs. It is similar to Livingston in some ways. No outside shot but he has shown he can distribute the ball effectively and still hit mid range shots. Plus he’s still very athletic and can be a good defender.",0

The ‘landing space’ rule for 3 point shooters has gotten completely out of hand and the NBA needs to make a POE to refs to stop giving guards all these damn 3 point fouls,52,dmqym2,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dmqym2/the_landing_space_rule_for_3_point_shooters_has/,29,1571999362.0,"What started out with good intentions (to protect three point shooters from injury) has gotten completely ridiculous. You’ve got James harden angling his feet outward on all of his three point shots. Steph Curry falls down on of all his 3PT attempts if anyone is within 5 feet of him. And every team in the NBA now runs the ‘my shooter will curl around a high screen and immediately stop and pull up for a three, if the defender is behind him he’ll graze him in the back and we get the call’, and the refs call it every time! 4 point plays used to be a rarity, because by and large, there isn’t really all that much contact on three pointers. What really bothers me about this trend is that we know it all was brought on when Zaza stepped under Kawhi in the 2016 west finals, but that wasn’t a natural defensive play at all, it was just a clear dirty play from a dirty player. And because of that one instance, every three point shooter since then has had a massive advantage over their defenders. It only harms officials ability to ref a game fairly because the standard of contact for a foul is completely different for guards and big men. It has always been this way in the league and refs just have to deal with that as part of the job, but this ‘landing space’ rule even further exaggerates the gap between what is a foul inside the paint and what is a foul outside of it.

TLDR I’m sick and tired of three point shooters getting these soft ass calls from refs 5 times a game and watching “SICK 4 POINT PLAY!” Highlights that are just dudes shooting a three and falling down",52

Give me promo codes for jerseys or some shit related do basketball... give me a lube ad even, but what kind of poser listens to daily basketball podcasts and buys custom suits?

For a 20-25 minute podcast, you listen to 5 minutes of ads, mostly about their own network. 

No, when I think of NBA duos I don't think about Nate fucking Duncan bruh. Quit that shit and go straight to the point with your own ads.

Toronto Raptors Should Start Lowry/Siakam/OG/Ibaka/Powell To Remain Competitive,0,dn8ro8,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dn8ro8/toronto_raptors_should_start/,25,1572091011.0,"This lineup is well balanced to run Siakam and Ibaka as primary scorers. Lowry as facilitator and secondary scorer. OG and Powell as wing scorers, both decent 3pt shooters. This lineup also allows for length/size for rebounding, athleticism and for Raptors to play their natural fast-pace basketball, one of their biggest strengths. 

You can easily achieve 25-30pts a night from Siakam, Ibaka 18-20pts, Lowry 15-17pts, OG 12-15pts and Powell 12-15pts. Ibaka is an underrated, well rounded, efficient scorer who is grossly underutilized, and deserves to be the starting day-to-day center for offense provision. Start Gasol only when facing teams with traditional bigs like Lakers, Portland, Dallas, Sixers, e.t.c.  If coach Nurse refuses to yield to this warning, Raptors will lose miserably.",0

Last night, he stole Reggie's thunder. Just like he habitually stole Teague's thunder in Minnesota. And with Blake out, he was pivotal in supporting Drummond's monster output to get this team its first win of the season. 

How long does Reggie have to prove he still deserves to be this teams starter? How long until the trade rumors start if he can't prove it?

I would probably have to agree that Wade was his best teammate, but I'd have to say Lebron during the Cleveland chip year (2015-2016) was the absolute pinnacle of his prime (brain and body perfectly in sync). **ESPN ranked that year 4th!? And ranked multiple Miami years ahead of that.**

Also, I know recency effect makes Bosh seem not as good as he was, but the man was a 25,10 in Toronto, deadeye shooter, silky smooth offensive game and very high IQ, plus THE REBOUND, so I have no problem with him over Kyrie at 3. AD on paper is 2, we shall see where he ends up.

Is Westbrook's playmaking underrated?,0,dn8dbm,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dn8dbm/is_westbrooks_playmaking_underrated/,42,1572088744.0,"I was watching Westbrook play yesterday, and I was really impressed by his playmaking. He got Capela, Chandler and Tucker a lot of easy looks. Westbrook may not be a good shooter, but his rim gravity forces teams to gear up and stop him, which leads to getting his teammates easy buckets. Even Popovich would use Kawhi or a bigger wing to guard Westbrook instead of KD.

Steven Adams had played very poorly so far. Obviously, I expect Adams to rebound, but Russ did such a good job making Adams an effective weapon. 

Sure Russ can be turnover prone, but turnovers aren't nessecarily a bad thing when it comes to playmkaing. It can actually indcate how may tough passes a player might make. 

It almost feels that Russ's playmaking is super underrated sometimes. In fact, I'd probably aruge that Russ is the best playmaking guard in the NBA.",0

What can yall say about this? I think it would provide more playmaking for the starters but less shooting. Looks like Danny Green will be the only one who is a 3PT threat in the starting lineup.",3

***Mitchell's quotes***

--

>Mitchell turned 23 last month and is beginning his third NBA season after an eventful first two. But this season promises something different for the 6'1"" Jazz guard. No longer will he be judged on what he can be, but on what he is.
>
>After a summer spent with Team USA and surrounded by a refitted roster built to make his life easier, Mitchell carries with him expectations he's rarely had as he quietly built his resume by listening to and learning from those around him. And if he is to lead the Utah Jazz to their first Finals in more than 20 years, and perhaps their first title ever, he'll need to keep doing so.
>
>""I try and carry myself in such a way, especially in this game,"" Mitchell said. ""This isn't college, where the oldest player could be 22, 21, whatever. I picked Thabo's [Sefolosha] brain when he was here. I picked Ricky's [Rubio] brain. I'm picking Mike's [Conley] brain. I'm picking Joe's [Ingles] brain, picking Rudy's [Gobert] brain, just so I can find ways to be better at my age than they were. Not necessarily them specifically, but if I can learn from Mike Conley, at 32, everything he knows, and Jeff Green, who played [for] years in the league ... [and] can learn all that now, I'll be light-years ahead of people that I'm around. It's an advantage.""

>As a rookie, he shined in the Slam Dunk Contest and filled a Gordon Hayward-sized void to lift Utah to an unexpected first-round playoff win over Russell Westbrook and the Oklahoma City Thunder. Though the Jazz drafted him 13th overall, Mitchell finished second to Philadelphia 76ers point guard Ben Simmons in the Rookie of the Year vote.
>
>Mitchell's second season tested him on multiple levels. A foot injury prevented him from training for much of the offseason. Early in the year, he struggled with his shooting efficiency, punctuated by his scoring 31 points on 35 shots with no assists in a November game against Philadelphia.
>
>""It was different,"" Mitchell said. ""Especially on offense, the opponent's top defender, having to guard you. So now it's Klay Thompson. It's Paul George, It's Kawhi [Leonard], it's Patty Bev. ... Now you're the priority. That's not like they're guarding you when you have a little hot streak. Now you're the target. It was a little different. I got to take a step back and figure it out. The stuff that works on the other guys, it's not going to work on those first-tier defenders. I had to get back and just slow down and just figure stuff out.""
>
>His coaches told him that this would be his new NBA.
>
>""They can tell you, 'Look, this is how they're going to do it,"" Mitchell said. ""But I'm a person that you just have to go out there and experience it and do it. Because that's how I am. I got to go through it and physically go through it, so it was unsettling at first. That was the fastest my life has ever moved. ... And I'm glad I did, because it just enabled me to learn, coming into this [past] summer, how to manage my time, how to even slow down in life.""
>
>Now that the season is here, Mitchell's life is speeding up again. 
>
>""We're chasing the Raptors, chasing Giannis [Antetokounmpo], chasing James [Harden], chasing those guys. Because in my career, I want to be an All-Star. I want to be MVP. I want to be a champion. There's always something that you want.""
>
>Joy wasn't in abundance this summer. Only two years into his NBA career, Donovan was thrust into a leadership role with Team USA during the FIBA Basketball World Cup. With stars bowing out because of injury or other commitments, Mitchell was entrusted with maintaining a legacy that had seen the U.S. men's national team pile up 78 consecutive wins in international competition coming into the summer.
>
>Mitchell played well, averaging 13.1 points, 5.0 assists and 4.3 rebounds in eight games. However, Team USA did not, tumbling to its worst international finish ever. But much as his mother had done, Mitchell absorbed his surroundings, processing what he saw and heard and how he could incorporate those things into his outlook. 
>
>""Obviously, we didn't win, but [it was valuable] to get guys from different organizations where they teach different things, whether it's sending middle or sending baseline or, you know, catching into iso versus catching and moving without the ball,"" Mitchell said. ""You've got the guys from the Celtics and Milwaukee, where it's iso, basically, but then you'd have somebody like Derrick White or Harrison Barnes, even Mason Plumlee, guys who move. So you have those two and you try to put them all together. 
>
>""We can't do it all with just a coach. You got to have the continuity from the players, so being able to merge those together in such a short amount of time, really helped me become a better leader as a whole and understand that people learn differently, how to explain things differently to Brook [Lopez] than how I explain it to Jaylen Brown or how I listen to Kemba [Walker] or how I listen to Marcus Smart. 
>
>""It's not always you saying, 'This, this, this, this, this.' There may be times where you are in the wrong and you need to find out why. And you may need to pick brains from a guy like a Khris Middleton or a Kemba, even some guys' minds my age, like Jayson [Tatum] and Jaylen.""
>
>Mitchell spoke while sitting in a dining hall adjacent to Utah's practice court. Around him, teammates grabbed lunch after finishing practice.
>
>""We're going through the same process right now,"" Mitchell said.
>
>He recalled watching a commemorative DVD of the 2008 Olympic team.
>
>""The biggest thing that stood out to me was they talked about LeBron [James] and how he was always the defensive anchor—talking, figuring stuff out,"" he said. ""I always wanted to be able to do that. ... So, knowing Mike's coming down, maybe in Memphis, they are two steps away from where you need to be. 'Mike, two steps to the right. We need to be right here on the elbow as opposed to two steps off.' Or maybe it's, 'Bojan [Bogdanovic], instead of turning your back this way, we turn this way. We sprint back.'
>
>""That's been one of the biggest things I took from Team USA ... being the one that never stops talking. Because there'll be times you get tired, but if you do it now and do it during practice when you're dead tired, when we get to Game 81, you get to Game 7, you're always ready to talk.""
>
>One thing hasn't changed, though: the chase. But where it once was to get noticed, now it is to use his unique abilities to find basketball joy within, to experience the type of happiness he watched as Kawhi Leonard brought Toronto its first NBA title last season.
>
>""I think the feeling that he had doing it there, I would love to have that here,"" Mitchell said. ""I would love to bring the state of Utah their first championship. I think that's one thing I've always wanted.""

Detroit Pistons are playing their home opener on the 2nd night of a back-to-back.,13,dmpyg6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dmpyg6/detroit_pistons_are_playing_their_home_opener_on/,10,1571994121.0,"In a season where the NBA has [reduced the number of back to backs that each team plays](https://www.nba.com/article/2019/08/12/nba-schedule-release-earlier-starts-fewer-back-backs), it seems rather absurd that the Pistons are the only team in the NBA to have to start their season on a back to back. And not only that, but their home opener is on the 2nd night of that back to back, when the team will be presumably gassed.

I know that if this happened to the Raptors, I’d be beyond pissed. The home opener is a signature game, and if this happened to a “bigger market” team, we wouldn’t be hearing the end of it, and rightfully so.

I feel as though the Pistons fans and players deserve better than this. No team should ever start the season on a back to back, and especially play their home opener on the 2nd night.",13

Viewership for ESPN’s season-opening NBA doubleheader on Wednesday was up eight percent from last year, according to Nielsen. The two games averaged 1,531,000 viewers, up from 1,423,000 viewers in 2018.

ESPN’s coverage of the Philadelphia 76ers victory over the Boston Celtics averaged 1,698,000, up six percent from 1,599,000 viewers for the Houston Rockets vs. the New Orleans Pelicans game last season.

The Denver Nuggets victory over the Portland Trail Blazers on ESPN averaged 1,345,000 viewers, up nine percent from 1,237,000 viewers for the Dallas Mavericks vs. Phoenix Suns telecast a year ago.

ESPN’s NBA regular season coverage continues this Friday, Oct. 25, as the New Orleans Pelicans host the Dallas Mavericks at 8 p.m. ET, followed by the Utah Jazz at the Los Angeles Lakers at 10:30 p.m.",22

I can see the “haha hornets bad” comments but this is the official NBA TV account, effort was put into this and they can’t even get the names of the players right. Pretty disappointing on the part of NBA TV to confuse last year’s 12th pick with this year’s 12th pick. Someone got paid to make this graphic, they spent a lot of time getting the right photo from this game and editing it, and they never realized which player it was.

That's not what they're doing now - if they were seriously testing everyone, lots of guys would be going down and not just Tyreke Evans for coke use. 

In a league with some of the most competitive athletes in the world, A LOT more guys than just Ayton would risk a positive test to get an edge and get a bigger contract.

Allowing rampant juice-use and then selectively applying it to Ayton is super unfair to him and the Suns and the false righteousness from the NBA is laughable here.

Edit: Beyond the obvious visual evidence and suspicious lack of suspensions (the NBA is the ONLY clean league with Dwight's shoulders out there, really guys???), here is some evidence on the testing policy now. There have been multiple write-ups by legit journalists on why/how the NBA drug policy is non-existent.

Derrick Rose said everyone was on PEDs before NBPA forced him to retract: https://www.businessinsider.com/derrick-rose-nba-steroid-problem-2011-5?r=US&IR=T

George Karl, the former Nuggets coach, openly said players use PEDs en masse as did Rip Hamilton. LeBron was implicated in the very real biogenesis scandal in Miami involving A-Rod. This isn't a random conspiracy lol

Woj: *Would you have said what you said to Kevin (the whole ‘we don’t need you thing’) away from the court, away from the game situation, and basically sent the same message, if you could do it over?*

Draymond: *100% because the thing that bothered me most was (...) The thing that bothered me the most was that, when Kevin goes [in the media]  and says ‘I wasn’t a part of [them]’ or ‘I was different from those guys’. A part of it is like, no you were one of us, and it pisses me off [that you would say otherwise]. But me knowing Kevin, and have an actual relationship with him, I know exactly what he’s saying. A lot of people didn’t know Kevin. I actually did. And I actually knew the way he was raised, I actually knew the things that bothered him, I actually knew the things he enjoyed. So like, the thing that bothered me most was, I lost his trust, and how do I get that back?*

Generally Draymond, in the rest of the pod, is taking responsibility for what happened on the Warriors last season, and especially between him and KD. And, as far as his answers goes, it seems like he was doing that through the latter half of last season. So I find it interesting how that thing that ultimately bothers him is KD going out and saying he wasn’t part of the group, because he feels that isn’t true. To me, it seems like Draymond thinks that KD is grabbing the fact that the whole ordeal happened in public, and using that as a reason for leaving the Warriors, which might not be entirely true. 

Ofc, I’m not gonna sit here and say what KD was or wasn’t feeling. Maybe he did truly feel like he wasn’t part of it. But Bob Myers (who is also on the pod) talks about a dinner that took place with the Warriors around Christmas where it really felt like they had something special, and that everyone truly loved one another.

Idk what’s right and what’s wrong, but to think about how Draymond was 1 year ago, to how he is as a player and person now, it seems like a very interesting transformation. On some level it seems like he regrets that not happening sooner so these things with KD hadn’t taken place.

In general, [this Woj Pod](http://www.espn.com/espnradio/play?id=27908368) is super interesting, talking about the last 5 years of the Warrior’s ups and downs, and their future with two (in my opinion) very intelligent people.",4648

The ESPN highlights of the game were all Kyrie/Brooklyn centric... not even one acknowledgement of the Wolves. I’m making this post because yes I’m salty but also because I find it ridiculous that media in general glorifies an individual performance for a player whose TEAM lost the game. In the end, Kyrie’s teammates failed him more than anything but at the end of the day, the Nets still lost the game.

This is just one example in a plethora of examples and this is rampant in the NBA in general. Media is all about the super star regardless of the outcome of the game and I truly think it’s impacting the youth in how they view team sports. It’s no longer about being a part of a team.

"Compare all the superstars in the league for the past 30 years, is it fair to say Kawhi has easily had the most support?",0,dn0186,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dn0186/compare_all_the_superstars_in_the_league_for_the/,111,1572050356.0,"This isn’t to say none of the teams needed him, they 100% needed him to get to the next level and contend but based on the support. Do you think he’s maximised the support he’s had? 2 rings and 2 DPOY but no MVP and it took him 8 years to be crowned the best in the league. Hypothetically, if you put Kobe/Lebron/MJ in his position I wonder how they would’ve done. 


- Spurs made the playoffs each year with him and had Pop, They might not have had the traditional all stars but TD, Manu, Parker even Aldridge’s basketball iq is very high. 

-Raptors had a great all round team and even a beat a fully healthy Warriors team by 20 at the Oracle without Kawhi last year 

-Doc is an elite coach, he has PG a top 5 two way player in the game, Lou/Harrell two studs of the bench and again a very good all round team.


Obviously the first comparison will be Lebron but he played with thrash from 03-10, won two games in the finals without Love and Kyrie in 2015, carried a very underperforming overrated Cavs team in 2018. He chose to go LA last year with Walton and the kids and this Laker team is strong bar the coach but has its weaknesses.

MJ didn’t have anyone particular till Pippen came in.Shaq only played in a few good situations. Kobe after Shaq left didn’t have a good team till 2009 then played with a poor cast till retirement. KD had Russ but never had good shooting , good vets or a good coach around him till GSW.


If I had to rank for whose had the most support in his career which I think is an important factor when comparing legacy  it would be Kawhi easily then Magic then MJ. Once again, I’m not hating but I’m newish to the league and wondering why people don’t use this when comparing players and if anyone has had more support?",0

Kawhi Leonard might become the greatest Raptor and the greatest Clipper ever in consecutive years,0,dn38ds,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dn38ds/kawhi_leonard_might_become_the_greatest_raptor/,37,1572063830.0,"I know it’s early for proclamations, but consider two franchises without an NBA championship or even a conference championship. For the Raptors, you could probably consider Vince Carter as their all time great with maybe Bosh a distant second. Leonard could never touch the obvious longevity of Carter in Toronto, nor probably the fan’s emotional connection, but his immediate impact on the team and the subsequent culture is a defining legacy that will be considered for the rest of the franchise history. Has any Toronto player ever had the same impact?

Then consider the Clippers. A team with a much longer history, but nothing much to show for it. Arguably Blake Griffin and Chris Paul would be the considerations for greatest Clippers, and it’s not an argument based on any particular tangible result, just that they are great players who happened to play for the Clippers at some point. Of course we have to wait to see what KL does in LAC, but once again his immediate impact on the team and on the culture is undeniable, and it’s hard to believe they he wouldn’t have them in serious contention every year he is a Clipper. Even with the Griffin/Paul years, I don’t think the Clippers have ever been taken as seriously as they are at this moment.

"Attempting to dispel the myth of ""OKC Wiggins"" or how Andrew Wiggins is not at his best vs. the Thunder",13,dmhlrf,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dmhlrf/attempting_to_dispel_the_myth_of_okc_wiggins_or/,23,1571957971.0,"There is a pervasive meme on this subreddit that Minneosta Timberwolves player Andrew Wiggins plays his best vs. the Oklahoma City Thunder. I don't know how or why this started, though he had a run over 7 games from the 16-17 to 17-18 season where he scored 18+ Points in all of them minus one. Maybe there are some late game heroics I'm unaware of that fuel the storyline. 

This is a pretty decent run, but somehow has entered the collective consciousness of the subreddit as something that is an ""essential"" part of Wiggins's identity as a player. OKC Wiggins is a thing to be feared, but overall he's played better vs. multiple other teams.

[This game](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201901080OKC.html), vs. OKC in January where he had a 40 point double double might have also catapulted the idea forward as it's one of the two best games of his career. However it's his only game in the top 35 of his career games by gamescore vs. OKC, where **he has 6** vs. the Lakers including [his career high scoring game](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201611130MIN.html) and 3 vs. the Kings and Cavs.

This table only includes teams he has a higher PPG against than OKC, but you could argue that he's had better career numbers vs. a handful of other teams.


Team | GP| PPG | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | TS%
---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----
CLE | 10 | 25.6 | 2.5 | 1.6 | 1.4 | .5 | 61.7%
TOR | 9 | 23.1 | 4.6 | 2.6 | .7 | .7 | 55%
LAL | 18 | 23.0 | 4.7 | 2.6 | .9 | .5 | 55.8%
SAC | 17 | 22.8 | 4.4 | 2.0 | 1.1 | .5 | 58.2%
OKC | 20 | 21.6 | 4.4 | 2.7 | 1.4 | .6 | 53.2%   
Career | 401 | 19.4 | 4.3 | 2.2 | 1.0| .6 | 51.9%


Considering who drafted him you would expect that somehow his dominance vs. the Cavs would be what people talk about. His efficiency and scoring vaults into superstar territory, and even things like his turnover rate drops.

**tl;dr** Wiggins career numbers vs. OKC are barely out of line with his normal career numbers where he has teams like the Cavs he has actually smoked.",13

Drummond had the 5th most steals and 6th most blocks last season,25,dmefvc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dmefvc/drummond_had_the_5th_most_steals_and_6th_most/,30,1571941628.0,"Average wise, he was 8th in both categories with 1.7 per game of each. This is on top of him leading the league in rebounding.

I never really thought of Drummond as that big of a defensive threat, but after his 4 blocks and 3 steals today, I realised that he was actually the league leader in combined steals and blocks, and has averaged at least 2.5 combined blocks and steals in every year of his career. Combine that with his rebounding, which he's the best in the league at, and it would suggest he'd have to be one of the very best defenders in the NBA.

Is he an underrated defender? Or do his defensive numbers flatter his actual game?",25

Surprises:

Hayward- dropping 25 after getting shit on all last year is pretty good


Kanter- held his own on defense and is an excellent rebounder. Outperformed my expectations by a lot


Disappointments:

Kemba-there’s basically 0 chance that last night is how he will perform for the rest of the year, but 4-18 is disappointing no matter what

People in this sub told me the Bucks were cooked against the Celtics and that Al Horford was the ""Giannis stopper"" after game 1 of the 2nd round last year too lol

Edit: So many HOF players have had elite seasons at 34/35 with the right conditioning (like LeBron) for those that want to mention age. Kareem, Jordan, Malone, and Dirk off the top of my head. Assuming he's cooked off of one game because he's 34 is horrible logic.",358

Did the Rockets get Worse with Russ?,0,dn5cnm,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dn5cnm/did_the_rockets_get_worse_with_russ/,54,1572073247.0,"*** DISCLAIMER: ITS ONE GAME***


The Rockets seem worse with Russ than with CP3. Forget everything else for a second. When they overloaded Harden in the fourth like teams tho, the ball always swung to the open man, Russ. Who proceeded to miss over and over again. 


This doesn't mean I think he sucks or sucked. I just think that this is about the ability to make a shot when the game is on the line and that's when CP was at his best. If not for that reason alone, which I think is what makes the difference in the playoffs, they should have kept CP.



I know it's one game, but what differences could they make to fix this?


The seemingly obvious one is to get the ball into Russ's hands and have Harden be off ball. Again, Russ is a great playmaker so not saying he sucks. But i know the answer to who I want to play make for me in the clutch and it's CP. I just don't see where the Rockets seemingly got better.



The other thing is health, which is obviously in favor of Russ. But I mean, you roster contruct with the best ideal fit and to me, that includes health. We will see and there's a lot of season left but IDK, not feeling the fit yet.",0
