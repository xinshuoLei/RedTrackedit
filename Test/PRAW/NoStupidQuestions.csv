Does anyone else stay up at night because they feel if they go to sleep then they havent gotten enough free time at home?,72380,cvy34d,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/cvy34d/does_anyone_else_stay_up_at_night_because_they/,4117,1566901538.0,"I'm a high school student, just a freshman, and sometimes I feel that if I go to sleep early then I'll just be like ""Well, this day just felt like school, barely any time at home.""

Edit: I know people don't like it when others edit their message saying ""thank you"" or anything, but DANG did I not expect this post to be the highest post in the sub after I, ironically, came home from school. Thank you all!  

It is interesting to see a lot more people than I thought stay up for free time as well. I can't imagine going to school or going to work, then going to sleep only a couple or few hours later, only to do the same thing again the next day.",2019-08-27 18:25:38

How do you repair relations with crows?,33667,9oeuas,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/9oeuas/how_do_you_repair_relations_with_crows/,2031,1539653669.0,"Story is relevant.

My neighbourhood has a lot of crows. Over twenty of them. They are generally on good terms with one another.

I watched them band together and kill one of the crows. They left its dead body in my yard. I waited until they cleared out and then went outside to clean it up because I don't want crow guts everywhere.

However, one crow was still in eyesight and cawed up a storm. This brought the other crows, and they all started swarming in the air. None of them dove at me but it was clear that they were upset with me doing this.

Now, they congregate and caw aggressively any time I am outside. Some swoop. They are becoming more and more aggressive.

Confusion on why they'd be mad at me for cleaning up _their_ mess aside, how do I repair relations with these crows? I don't want to deal with being attacked every single day by multiple crows. 

Google is not helpful on this front at all. There is surprisingly little documentation on how to make crows like you after you've cleaned up the corpse of one of their peers.

Anyway, would it hurt to die that way? 

He was working the controls, standing on the back of the truck when the arm of the drill hit the power line. Witnesses saw the truck burst in flames, and the fire department wasn’t able to make it to the truck for over an hour. 

I wanted to know if it was instant? Would it hurt? Did he burn alive? 

I told my mom that it was instantaneous and he didn’t even know what happened, but reading online I don’t know if that’s true. 

I’m crying right now, it just sucks and I miss him terribly. 

Edit: For those asking, this accident happened last May. The emotions are raw and fresh again because Easter is coming up and we had all made plans to go to the mountains, last year during that time.

I had cancelled the plans last minute and a few days later the accident happened.

With it coming up again, I just keep thinking why did I cancel? We could have had one last day with him but we didn’t. I want to go up this year, in his memory but I don’t know if I can.

This is dangerous. What can I do to notify her parents ?  It is an ATT number. Should I call them? 



Edit : I looked up the number on social media. Nothing. I reported it to tinder using their online form. 

She used fake pictures of course. I could certainly tell a 10 year old from an 18 year old. I will not be notifying parents or local agencies of any kind. I reported it to tinder and that’s all I will do. Some parents think their children are perfect and could twist the blame on me instead of themselves. The second she said she was 16 (before she admitted she was 10) I hung up and reported the profile, and unmatched. She revealed she was 10 while I was in the process of blocking the number. 

Even before she said she was under 18 I said absolutely zero things that wouldn’t be okay to say to a ten year old, so I know I’m in the clear. I believe there’s zero case to be made for any sort of enticing or anything like that. ",2019-02-17 13:32:42

EDIT1: Spelling.

EDIT2: Pictures of the note: [https://imgur.com/a/ocJDxhK](https://imgur.com/a/ocJDxhK)

EDIT3: Seems like it is ASCII code, thanks to u/Vicvic38 and u/Nrutasnz.

EDIT4: Most logical answer is that it's some kind of a Halloween or birthday prank.

**EDIT6: Trying to summarize it: the note is an** **ASCII sequence** **which can be translated to a** **HEX code** **+ the sentence ""u r alone now dont come after me"". The HEX code is a** **location** **somewhere in Tibet/China in reverse and also says ""in a red bag"". Could be a birthday prank or a puzzle for my present but I live in Europe.

I’ve been “disowned” or something. They made it really clear they wont be taking me back. Im 20, no job, no real friends and no family at all.

I was able to get my bike from my parents’ since i did buy it with my own money and took my life savings which so happen to only be $130. Maybe it hasnt hit me yet cause its only been a few hours but its starting to get really late and i have nowhere to go or sleep. I was considering a hotel but that would take a huge chunk out of my money so im considering just doing an all nighter in a 24h mcdonalds. Im guessing I’ll have to buy something every few hours so I won’t get kicked out. 

So basically what the fuck do i do next? Im considering maybe odd jobs but i have no idea how to find them. So if there’s an app or a website for that I’ll take recommendations.




Edit: im saved!! Well not yet, but i was able to contact an old high school friend of mine. He works night shifts and he said he can pick me up after so it won’t be until 5 or 6 am. Right now my plan is just to stay at the mcdonalds until then. Im really thankful for everyone who commented and tried helping. This post was kind of dramatic but im glad i wont have to sleep in the streets

Edit2: wow this blew up fast. I see a lot of people doubting that my parents just kicked me out overnight. I never really got along with them, i worked at a car-wash for a while until a few weeks ago and thats when the arguments started happening. I wasnt paying for rent anymore and i did get a little bit depressed and didnt really care about anything. Im not saying it isnt my fault what happened, it absolutely is, this was a wake up call. I’m extremely grateful to my friend, he is allowing me to stay up to 2 months to get my shit together. As long as i pay for the internet and my own food.

A lot of people think that the fact my life savings is only  $130 is because im a drug addict, that isnt it. I worked a minimum wage job while parents asked me for rent and internet (i dont blame them).

A lot of people were recommending joining the military. I’ve considered the Navy when i was younger and i might as well do it now, better than never so im going to meet up with a recruiter tomorrow (already talked on the phone)


((Edit3)) a lot of people have asked if i have a paypal or venmo.

"Was I sexually assaulted?

There’s this girl there who keeps flirting with me and harrasing me, touching my arms, openly announcing she’s looking through my social media profiles, won’t stop snapping me or Facebooking me, I’ve since deleted her Snapchat and blocked her on Facebook. 

Anyway, yesterday during lunch hour, she kept feeling my arms. I moved my arm away to which she responded “don’t you like to be touched?” to which I responded “not by you”. So she went to kick me in the balls but I moved out of the way and said “no chance”. 

As we all went to leave work later that day, there was a slight hold up at the door so we were all just jammed up and stood in a line, she was in front of me. She moved her ass against my crotch and touched it with her hands to which I pushed her away from me and warned her not to do it again. She said “I’m only joking” before trying to do it again IN FUCKING PLAIN SIGHT OF THE OTHERS. I told her to fuck off and leave me alone and then she laughed and accused me of being gay. All the girls laughed, while all the guys looked disgusted. The manager wasn’t present during this.

Anyway, we all left and me and a friend were walking and he turned to me and said “dude, isn’t that basically sexual assault?” I responded “is it?” He said “man, she literally molested you and tried again” 

Honestly, I don’t know what to think. I am contemplating telling the manager but I feel she’ll laugh it off and class it as a joke because I’m a man. And no offence to us guys, but harrassment and sexual assualt isn’t taken as seriously if a man is getting harrassed. Just think of it, if I had done that, I’d be fired on the spot and have the cops on my case.

PS. I will have this filmed and post it on youtube with links.  Not gonna be happy, but I will post video evidence whenever I can, maybe even the poopy (gross).

Update #3: I just completed the video recording of this and will be uploading it to YouTube shortly. I'll post the link here but I'll have to post a link to it in a new post somewhere too, I can't let this go to waste.

The whole ""arguing with facts"" , being extremely confident and forward, is my best way of describing the personality of the two mentioned in the title (amongst others, that Steven Crowder guy from the meme). You see them debating hundreds of people and ""never being wrong""; although usually they're arguing less experienced people.

I'm not taking a political stance here, but generally these debaters have compilations on youtube on how they ""destroy a liberal"" or ""dismantle socialism in front of a communist crowd"", and the whole idea of someone speaking that is regarded as never being wrong, usually puts me off.

But I never see a similar personality type of a left-wing debater. Hell I can't recall seeing a prominent left wing figure that does public speeches and debates where they ""dismantle the capitalist agenda"".

Again not in any way arguing for or against right wing/left wing. I don't think right wing argues with facts and left with feelings, thats just the result of the image Ben shapiro seems to commercialize",2019-02-01 02:46:41

Here’s something for you: my brother (in middle school) is constantly live-streaming to his two or so viewers. As a bonus, he tries to be a soundcloud rapper. 

Just now he let the dog shit in the house (he was supposed to be watching her), pretended his B.B. gun was a glock and shot at some rabbits outside, punched a wall, and is now blasting some rather trash rap. He says today is his 24 hour livestream. 

It’s my one day off this week and I am desperate to read some of my book and do some yoga. How can I end this bullshit? 



Update: I ended up unplugging the WiFi and hiding his charging cable. Turns out he was using WiFi, so this was pretty affective. I made him come with me to the local park, though he screamed like a massive cunt. Brought a ball and we played football.

I’d like to thank everyone for there mostly legal suggestions, can’t say reddit isn’t creative. Especially the people who talked me out of any malicious actions and suggested more kind things I could do. Though I’d like to snip internet cables or have one of you lovely people hack him, I think it’s better to keep his music/videos for later embarrassment.

A pigeon just laid an egg on my fucking bed and is always coming inside my room.,13280,bt5kof,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/bt5kof/a_pigeon_just_laid_an_egg_on_my_fucking_bed_and/,823,1558888069.0,"So really quick background on this, I live in my apartment in an 11th-floor room and hence we have rooms with a small balcony on the corner. So there are this two pigeons (a couple I assume) and they are always sneaking into my room and then sits on the bed. I thought they were like dumb and would scatter them away. So some days later, I found a twig in my bed. AND then is when I realized that these birds want to fucking make a nest in my bed. So I then threw away the stick and shut the windows and the balcony to restrict them.

So things were kinda okay but then after coming home, I found that I forgot to close the windows and one of them came inside and is comfortably sitting on my bed. And also my bed was like full of clothes, 'cause I was too lazy to sort them out. I scared the pigeon away, but then I found an egg in my bed. IT FUCKING LAID AN EGG. Why are these birds so dumbasses? Man, also I live in an area with nature and trees around it and out of all those wonderful places, you had to pick my bed. I didn't throw the egg away or anything, that was morally wrong as I thought.  So I put out a pan with a rag on top of it and the placed the egg on it and kept it in the balcony.  But the bird is NOT coming to it and is again trying to sneak in the room. I placed the egg literally next to their sight and still, the mama bird ain't even sitting on top of it? So what am I gonna do? Will the egg not hatch if this goes on?

So is there any problem that if I touch the egg, the birb won't accept it or shit?

&#x200B;

EDIT; These things happened in a span of three weeks btw, so it first came to my room in the first week, I found a twig during the second week, and the egg in the end of the third week (just yesterday)

&#x200B;

**EDIT** \#2: So I'm back from watching Detective Pikachu and boy RIP my inbox. And ALSO THE PIGEON FINALLY SAT ON MY READY-MADE NEST. I'll keep you guys updated with pics, for now I'll take a quick nap

&#x200B;

EDIT #3:[So these are the pics](https://imgur.com/a/TqS2Mdi). And sorry for the quality and if the bird looks like a monster preparing to shoot lasers at me, I had to use flash.

&#x200B;

***EDIT*** \#4: Idk if anyone is here, but the bird laid two eggs as expected. So when I found the bird and the egg on my bed, I think it was gonna lay another egg but I scattered it away. And quick facts on pigeons on the way;

* Sometimes the mama and the papa bird may share the time sitting on the eggs
* Most often they egg two eggs, but not simultaneously (yeah I thought they laid two at the same time)
* And as u/Kelekona said, they mostly nest in cliffs most often, so I'm guessing the apartment looked like a cliff to it? Man these birbs",2019-05-27 00:27:49

I saw a post in the “askwomen” sub and they were all about how Hugh Hefner is a gross misogynistic guy who exploited women with the playboy magazine. This confuses me because it was my understanding that he did not force women to do the things women did for playboy. IIRC these women in the playboy magazine and playboy mansion were consensually choosing to pose nude (which is not a bad thing: your body, your choice, do you) and be in the mansion. So why do some people hate Hugh so badly? Like what exactly did he do? And also how did the playboy mansion work?

I have never in my life heard a single legit reason other than the obvious ""pee is gross so don't do it"".

You are under a constant stream of water and there's already dirt, soap, whatever else you may need to scrub off going down the drain and human urine is less harmful to the environment than some of the things that get washed down the drain. And we all know that water doesn't get recycled through your tank. 

The only other reason I've ever been given is ""girls shouldn't because it just runs down their leg and that's gross, especially since they probably just shaved their leg so all those pores are opened up"" which, personally, my first response was `??????????????????` and my second was `no`.

I will fight to the end for my right to pee in the shower and this world isn't strong enough to stop me, I will show no mercy as my fluids release under warm euphoric streams of life-giving aqua.

But for real I am genuinely curious from an educational standpoint.

Edit: I know it isn't totally clear but I'm specifically referring to private showers, not something like a locker room shower or other communal showers. Some folks in the comments have been nice enough to point this out as a more common reason for that to be spread as a standard.

There's a ventilation shaft in the utility closet with the water heater, right next to the door, which is also right next to the washer and dryer. Anyone outside of my door can smell the weed coming from the ventilation, and any time you walk into my apartment it's the first thing you smell. Being a military family and having our laundry smell like weed can get us both in really, really big trouble. Is there any way I can prevent this?  
  
It happens around 10 at night, clearly outside of the housing department's operating hours. This place was built in 2016, so it's pretty new.  
 
  
Edit: wow this blew up. I was not expecting that. Try to get back to the comments in the morning lol  
  
Edit 2: Thanks for all the responses, guys. Wasn't expecting this to be popular at all. Reading through most of the comments (and sorry I don't have time to reply to everyone!), I think my best temporary option is to try filtering the smell from the vent I think it's coming from as best as I can. If that doesn't work, I may try the ""positive air flow"" technique recommended by the thermodynamics stoner. A more long-term solution would be to contact housing if it continues to be a problem, as my only two concerns is that my apartment doesn't have a smell when I move out, and my wife's clothes don't smell like weed when she's at work.  
  
Reading through my lease agreement, I actually don't see anywhere that mentions drug use, or even smoking of any kind. Thinking back, the area around the demo room when we were being shown around before we signed a lease reeked of weed as well.  
  
Lastly, I'm not trying to get anyone in trouble. I don't care if anyone else smokes weed. I was born and raised in Austin. I can probably count on one hand how many people I knew that didn't smoke weed in my 30 years living there. I just don't think my apartment needs to smell like that, you know?

Are there other people out there like me ? I'm a guy if that's relevant.

opinion 2: no it doesn't, he still has arms, one would assume he has a stomach and stuff in the bottom half of the round part which wouldn't be considered the head, decapitation would be cutting him across just above the arms, this would mean that Mikes eye is on his head, while his mouth is more on his torso, in addition, most creatures in the movie(s) come from a source of realism (eg. randall being a generic lizard, the mean lady being a slug, and the boss guy being a spider, and sully being some kind of bear or something if you count that) so it's fair to assume there's some kind of realism as to where Mike's stomach, kidneys, bladder, etc goes

Usually I just show up for a few hours and be hetero and leave.

But they want to know why I haven't settle down and married a nice lady and had a few kids. 

Truth is, I been married to a man for the last 6 years. We have a kid together and a life together.

And they are against gay marriage and interracial marriage. I'm Italian and my husband is super duper white. And they assume they are entitled to my life despite only being my foster parents for the last few years before my 18th birthday. Narrsistic people. Rude. Religious. 

Shout out to rasiedbynarrsitc and entitledparents subbreddit by the way.

Also these are the same people that firmly believe my gay was a phase. They sent my a gay-away camp. I ended up getting caned and two of my ribs are no longer attached to my rib cage due to the canning. They believe that the canning helped cure me and so it was a just beating. 

Btw I lived in America during this time, so please vote every November to end conversion camps.

So yeah. Seeing them mid July. What is the best way to tell them that I am still gay, happily married, and a proud dad?

And apparently it’s “would anyone rob someone that’s driving a car with a giant 360 degree camera on it”.

Not gonna lie though, it’s been interesting seeing how many of you have zero idea of how bad some neighborhoods are in America and anyone who does must “get all their information from Fox News”. I guess when y’all google “deadly carjacking” or even “carjacking” google just shows an error message.

I’m also done trying to argue with people about it because they went down a bad neighborhood once and it was fine. It’s been fun guys, have a good one.

A final edit for anyone who lives in a city that I can find an article listing the most dangerous areas there that disagrees with me regarding how dangerous neighborhoods can be. If you drive down the street of my choosing going the speed limit and upload a video of it as proof, I’ll donate $10 to the charity of your choice (with a max of $100). Just comment on this post or private message me, and I’ll add your username up here. Once you upload the video I’ll also upload it as proof of me being wrong about violence happening to random passersby, and proof of the donation.

Edit: it’s going to need to be after 5 pm as well (if it’s like 4:45 I’m not going to split hairs though. I’m not trying to make people go after dark because that would be stacking the deck a little much).

Final edit (besides when I start posting donation proof tomorrow): I started thinking about it a little bit, and it just feels wrong to do this. I’m basically turning lower income areas into a zoo for people online to gawk at and for my own amusement. And based on ALL the street view pictures I saw while trying to find prime dangerous areas, nothing would happen. There was never anyone outside, and I believe all the videos would have proven that.

And even if something did happen, I paid someone $10 to be traumatized.

I appreciate everyone offering to go, and have messaged or replied to them all updating them on all of that. I asked that they tell me the charity of their choice and I will add it next to their name if they reply in the next 30-45 minutes.

It was pretty disturbing. Probably more disturbing than when she evacuated her bowels, even, because at least I was told that would happen. I just can't get that broken laugh out of my head.

And if I'm going to have flashbacks about it, I just kind of want an explanation or to know if anyone has experienced the same.

Edit: Thank you, everyone, for your explanations and your kindness. Fortunately, my original doctor and therapist from when I was in high school (when my mom first got sick) are in my insurance network again. They got me in right away, even though mental assessment appointments are usually a month out. And, they're friends, so they talk to each other often about my treatment plan. I've basically got the mental healthcare provider dream team. I've also started a meditation practice and walk more often.

I have been neglecting my OCD, depression, and anxiety for years, but no more. I have a life to live. I feel like it would be spitting on my mom's existence (and her nine year battle) to let my mental illness continue keeping me from being joyful and reaching goals. I have to be strong enough to carry this torch.",2019-07-06 17:59:31

I didn't come here to tell a story, and sorry for the bad english but I don't know what to do, my father (38) hits my mom (37). Only her, he doesn't hit me (14) or my little sister (5). But still, we are afraid of him.

Some quick context: my mom wants to divorce my dad because he cheated on her 3 times and still does to this day but when she brings that up he gets crazy and insults her and hits her (not as hard to kill her or do some serious damage, but she still gets bruises). When he gets drunk he also gets really mad and does the same thing but this time he threatens me when I intervene.

Also, we live in Argentina if that matters.

I'm really sorry if this is not the place but I really want this to stop ~~(tell me a better site/subreddit and I'll delete the post)~~ this started in 2013 and it's not stopping. My mom doesn't want to call the police because she is afraid they'll just let him go and make him REALLY mad. I don't want my sister to go through this, I already got used to it.

Up until today, she tells me she “needs a new laptop” because the charger has to be held at an angle to work now. I told her I’ll help her with the cost of repair, but she tells me she needs a new one and wants me to cover the cost. Am I wrong to think she’s just being greedy and using me? My gut instinct is to tell her I don’t owe her a brand new laptop, I owe her the cost of repair. 

I don’t want to make a big deal out of it, but she asked me late at night in a rather rude way with an attitude, when I just responded professionally asking what I can do to help cover the cost of repair. Not sure what the best course of action is. 

I don’t have the money to buy her a new laptop and I truly refuse to do that, but I can gather up a little from my next pay cheque to help her with a repair.


edit: To clarify, she was balancing it on a small upside down trash can as she was sitting on the floor in front of it while doing her makeup while me and several other friends were predrinking in her room for the club.

Is it lame to report a shoplifter?,8093,8jw9ph,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/8jw9ph/is_it_lame_to_report_a_shoplifter/,1241,1526516721.0,"I was in CVS yesterday and I saw this punk-ass 16 year old looking kid stuffing things into his hoodie so I went up to the register and told one of the guys working there. The kid tried to walk out and the employee stopped him, took the stuff back, and let the kid leave and then thanked me profusely when I was checking out.  

I told my SO about it and she called me a narc and said I'm lame. Her logic was that CVS was a big corporation so they wouldn't notice a few dollars in stolen goods and it's possible the kid was trying to feed his family. I said instead of stealing maybe he should get a part time job and work to feed his family like everybody else (it's not like we live in Chicago, we live in a middle-class suburb of a very rich city). 

Am I a lame old man for reporting the kid?

**Edit**: Based on everybody's replies I can see that this is a controversial topic. Overall, however, with your help I've decided that what I did was not lame. To all those saying I should evaluate my relationship, SO, etc., it's not like she was seriously upset that I reported the kid, she was just teasing. 

**Edit 2**: I've read through all the top-level comments I've gotten so far and it is almost exactly a 50-50 split. This is crazy interesting. What I don't get most is the people who say, ""it doesn't affect you, it's none of your business, just let it be."" I suspect those are the same people who hear their neighbor beating their wife through the apartment walls and don't do anything because, ""it's none of my business."" 

**Edit 2.5**: I went back to buy some cookies and it looks like the only thing stealable in the area he was was either alcohol or powdered Kool-Aid/Tang mix. Let me restate, this was in the alcohol aisle so he could've stole that before I got there. Not necessities. 

**Edit 3**: Thank you /u/DeckhandFlout for providing the ultimate answer to this question which should settle it for everybody. ""Peter Parker decided to not stop a guy from stealing stuff.

The really interesting thing is that the email address this threat was sent to, and the password given, indicate they got this information from Neopets (which I haven't played in about 2-3 years)

The email has no identifying info besides password and email - no name except what's in my email address.

Given that the threat isn't credible, BUT it's a legitimate password and attempted blackmail, should I do anything? Report to police? Try to report to Neopets? Ignore and delete?

I'm in Australia, if that makes a difference. My replies will be intermittent as I am heading to work now.

Edit: I can't believe this got so much attention, wow. I appreciate everyone with helpful information and I will look into most suggestions, not going to reply to everyone at this point though because wow.
