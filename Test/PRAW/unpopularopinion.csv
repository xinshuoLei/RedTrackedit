Eating cereal with water is better than with milk,78957,bahrim,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/bahrim/eating_cereal_with_water_is_better_than_with_milk/,6028,1554681858.0,"I am a true believer that cereal with water is better. The taste of milk conflicts with the taste of the cereal, whereas water does not. While still getting the same texture, water does not ruin the taste of cereal. My friends crucified me when I told them this...so for this reason I am coming here in search of others who share my beliefs of water being better than milk. 

Edit: I pour the cereal before the water, for those asking

Reddit not covering the Sri Lanka bombings the same way it covered the New Zealand shootings is dirty politics.,68471,bfq3y6,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/bfq3y6/reddit_not_covering_the_sri_lanka_bombings_the/,5146,1555890200.0,"The 'front page of the internet' shouldn't be censoring breaking news just because it might trigger a few Muslims.

Evil is evil. Stop blocking breaking news.






Edit: I would like to clarify. 
I am not pro/anti-white, anti/pro-Christian, or anti/pro Islam.

I am simply stating that this act of violence as well as all other tragedies should get equal coverage, I had to go deep into reddit to find any news and its appalling. 200+ people lost their lives, and it didn't get the same attention as Notre Dame or New Zealand massacres. 

I don't think they get the same coverage because of a fear of triggering a particular group, in this case Muslims. It could have been extremist Christians and I would say the same thing about them. 

Humans really are the greatest risk to humanity. Stop the violence and protect the planet. Why is it so hard for some people to not be shitty?",2019-04-22 07:43:20

In a [speech Schumer gave](https://thoughtcatalog.com/anonymous/2014/05/wait-a-second-did-amy-schumer-rape-a-guy/) at the  Ms. Foundation for Women‚Äôs Gloria Awards and Gala, she confessed to having sex with a college friend that was so drunk, he couldn't even get an erection let alone consent to having sex. ""And then came the sex, and I use that word very loosely. His penis was so soft, it felt like one of those de-stress things that slips from your hand"". Sex without consent is the very definition of -rape-.

Amy also confessed to sexually assaulting her male cab driver in a podcast and casually laughed about it; nobody cared. In this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UrhXqRq2_4&feature=youtu.be&t=480), Amy admits to forcefully grabbing her driver's hand, putting it on her vagina and getting the driver to finger her. The host says ""so you raped a guy"" at [11:12](https://youtu.be/8UrhXqRq2_4?t=670) and Amy replies ""yeah I know. When I tell this story I say I let a cab driver finger me but really I took his hand...\[sic\]"".

Edit - thanks for the silver and gold people. I hope this was for agreeing with the premise and not because I sounded like I wanted a cookie for being a dad. It may have sounded like I wanted credit for some shit I'm supposed to do. 

That's not the case. I've been to mom groups to socialize my kids and I'm this weird anomaly and they don't even talk to me so then I play with my kid so I'm not just there on my phone. Its not the same for us. We don't have the same resources. Although some of you have suggested some that I hadn't heard of.

Like there's Barbie movies too in which Barbie saves the day and is portrayed as competent and heroic, whereas Ken is a borderline idiot who kisses the ground she walks on and always gets in trouble. A lot of kids shows are like this. The father figures are weak, the mother figures all-knowing. 

In Peppa Pig, specifically, the father of Peppa is an engineer. He has blue prints lying around the house and everything, has an office, works hard, is a pillar of the community, and yet he's constantly made fun of and used as the butt of jokes because he's a bit fat.

I've had enough.

I have nothing against religion. You can believe whatever you (want to) believe in order to get through life and live your best one. However, critiquing others' - no matter how positively - by thanking a being we have no concrete proof exists for the doing of someone else is just a massive insult and injustice.

I've seen so many posts and comments on nice posts about how, for example, ""God is amazing for helping those doctors save that little girl, and for successfully giving her the surgery she needs"".

No. I don't care how real you think he is, God had nothing to do with that. Those men and women went to many years of medical school - where they learned from and were taught by other professionals, not God - and paid many dollars to get to where they are. God did not guide that person's hand; skill, knowledge, training, and *their* muscles did. God did not come down from the heavens. God did not pick up a scalpel and fix your child. God did not do that surgery. *They did*. And saying that God did is a massive insult to that person because it negates everything they've done in order to save someone. It completely ignores the effort, time, money, and passion they put into their career and life in order to save someone else's. *Especially* if that person is not religious.

Sure. You can call it a miracle or God's work if you had just enough milk for your cereal or finished both the shampoo and conditioner at the same exact time. God didn't do that either, for all of *your* previous actions did, but whatever. It doesn't really matter because nobody did anything monumental and praise-worthy there.

But to say that God did something amazing like save a child's life, take down a school shooter, apprehend a thief, found a missing person, etc is just wrong. It's simply appalling and unfair, and blatantly discredits the actual people who went through many tiring, challenging, immense processes to give someone something amazing. You're giving the praise to a, quite frankly, fictional being rather than the physical ones that concretely and very obviously sacrificed so much for you. It's just wrong.

**Small edit just to fix a word here and there, as well as clarify**: I recognize that starting this off with ""I have nothing against religion"" may seem counter-intuitive. But I don't have anything against religion as a whole; I have something against those who use religion to discredit others for their benefit, ignore reality, and praise someone who quite plainly didn't do the action that is getting praise. It's a simple matter of a lack of respect. Additionally, I don't mean the common ""thank God!"" phrase - that's perfectly fine. What I mean is the active, continuous thanking of God versus those people involved in something amazing (such as *only* thanking God and not those involved, or simply making God the main focus of the gratitude).

I know it's not all lollipops and rainbows. I supported my wife every single day through her pregnancy and¬†I helped her through the nausea, the body aches, and the terrible pain of giving birth. I know there are risks and complications and it's not something everyone wants to do. I wish I could do it, though.


My wife and I agreed we wanted a baby as soon as we had a house. Thankfully, she was able to become pregnant (I really feel for the women who can't have babies and wish they could) and we now have a toddler who is an absolute joy.


She loved being pregnant.¬†Every day we talked about the baby growing in her womb that we couldn't wait to meet. I kissed her belly hundreds of times. And I fell in love with her all over again every time I looked at her. Her hand was pretty much glued to her belly, always rubbing it and humming a song. The bond that is formed between the mother and child is simply beautiful.


The hardest part about it is that I'll never be able to realize this wish and I never had a choice in the matter. Women can choose (in most cases) whether or not they want to become pregnant. And I don't know how the logistics of it all would work, anyway. Maybe if we lived in a world where both men and women were built with the capability to have babies, kind of like seahorses. I know it's not realistic, but if it were possible to give me a uterus transplant I'd consider it. I would go through considerable pain and effort if it meant I could get pregnant.


Every guy I've ever told has either looked at me like I'm insane or just straight-up laughed at me. Women I've told seem to understand, but nobody really takes it seriously except for my wife. She knows it's not a joke and that it's an actual dream of mine. Any guys out there agree with me?


Edit: Some people are rightfully pointing out that my wife's pregnancy went smoothly and that we are very fortunate. I do not disagree. However, I disagree that I have an idealized view of pregnancy. Just because things went well for her does not mean they would for me and does not mean they go well for others, but it also does not invalidate my feelings. As I stated above, I am well-informed of the risks that come with pregnancy.

Expanding on what I said in my reply to their comment, it's a weird communal flocking to what's trending in an attempt to be a cool, trendy person; but it's usually after the place the meme came from has moved on. It's wanting to be hip without actually expending the effort to find and participate in the source.",2019-08-18 19:02:22

No shit they were racist -- when slavery was common, racism was casual. It's just how things were. Despite how morally superior you think you are now, you would have been raised in a household where racist comments were normal, and you would have grown up with those same views.

It's absurd to suggest that we start altering our history to speak only of the people who were purely good by today's standards. We would literally have zero founding fathers in history books if we were to stop honoring them because of their racist views at the time.

Note: This post inspired by a twitter rant about HP Lovecraft's overt racism... who the fuck cares. Dude was a good writer; his views were a product of his time. Get over it.

Edit: My inbox hurts. Thanks for helping me pass the time at work today, this is fun. Also, I get it, Lovecraft was *particularly* racist. Still a good writer though, and his views shouldn't have any bearing on whether or not we can look at him that way. Separate the art from the artist.

I agree it's important, but it's nothing you need a parade for.  There are waaaay bigger issues that get very little traction, such as the number of people living in poverty, even in the most developed nations.  Why is that?  Is it that the issues that affect huge percentages are too difficult to address?  Is it that no one in Hollywood is poor, but a disproportionate number are gay, so there is no platform for poverty?  Is the feeling that poverty is a choice?  Why don't we have parades for teachers or people who are working to better the world for much larger percentages of the population?

Disclaimer - I know it's been a long, hard fight for basic human dignity for homosexual people.  I don't debate that and I have tremendous respect for those people who suffered and continue to suffer for this cause. Not only respect, but gratitude.  The world as a whole is definitely better because of their sacrifices. But still...

"Telling people who have severe facial deformities that they're beautiful is disingenuous, patronizing, dishonest, and self-congratulatory.",35960,bhk3ly,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/bhk3ly/telling_people_who_have_severe_facial_deformities/,2559,1556297425.0,"There's a youtuber named Nikki Lilly who does music and makeup videos on youtube. She looks like [this](https://i.imgur.com/HqmUQng.jpg).

If you go to the comments section of any of her videos, you see hundreds or thousands of comments that are telling her how beautiful she is. There are rarely any other kind of comments as far as I can tell.

Now, this kind of strikes me as similar to telling an overweight woman that she is skinny. By no societal standards in the world that I can imagine would this girl be considered physically beautiful. She has a condition that causes her to have a severe and grotesque deformity on half of her face. She doesn't deserve to be bullied for this, of course. But I think the millions of fans she has and these thousands of comments are no coincidence. I think her appearance is the reason for her popularity, and so people view her as a freakshow, just of a different kind. People flock to her to her channel since they see her as a freakshow, but they just leave patronizing comments telling her how beautiful she is so they and everyone who upvotes them can feel good about themselves.

I see this as extremely strange behavior. It's almost as if Nikki is some sort of ""moral well"" from which people can draw in order to feel good about themselves and others, to have an unspoken, massive communal back-patting party in the comments about how good they all are as people. Her videos have thousands or tens of thousands of comments. People know the creator of the video will probably not see the comments, however they *do* know that other people will. That's why they leave these comments.

This is a bizarre new kind of phenomenon, and while I'm always happy for a fellow youtuber getting attention on their channel, I don't think this is a good kind of attention. I think it's actually a very disingenuous and off-putting kind of trend. It leaves me feeling very dirty and confused about the nature of social media.

It wouldn't be so bad if the comments were just normal, mildly supportive or even constructive comments, but these comments are really exaggerated. All caps, dozens of heart emojis, lots of exclamation points. It's almost as if they're trying to one-up each other for who can be the most overwhelmingly supportive and saccharine with their comments. It's actually kind of disgusting. I don't even know if we have words for this kind of behavior, since this is kind of a new phenomenon.

Really, I just feel sorry for this girl. I wonder if she understands what's going on.

EDIT: There are a lot of people talking about the subjective quality of beauty. In case it's unclear, I'm talking about the physical attractiveness of someone's face, which has a [basis in science](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/social-instincts/201507/what-facial-features-do-men-really-find-attractive?collection=1077685). I understand that beauty as a poetic concept does indeed have a high degree of subjectivity, but that's not what I'm talking about. Remember that Nikki is primarily a makeup/beauty vlogger, so comments about her being beautiful are likely referring to her appearance.

Geez stop assuming that your country have figured out all the shit already. And now you have no problems and are left with helping the third world countries. So stop saying, hey I'm from Norway and I don't want to adopt an African child. Your country have zero orphanage?
It's funny how most of you guys assumed that you have to adopt a kid from African countries.

No I'm not pro 'let's adopt and help the third world'
I'm pro ""can't feed em, don't breed em""! 
But if you have money to raise a child, try adopting one, it'll make you happy and you'll be giving a child probably a new beautiful life.

And someone said the adoption cost is ~30,000$ like wtf!
Your country needs to figure out some shit for that man. This cost is an average cost to raise a child for 10 years fulfilling his basic needs and school fees in my country man!

Yes I'm aware that the height setting is optional, similar to Bumble, and it's not as bad as something like Hinge where you're required to put your height, whereas women aren't required to put their weight.

Sugar? It's indiscernible and, frankly, a little bland. All you really get with the base flavor is fizz. 

With the vanilla flavor, however, the whole soda gets creamier, smoother, with a flavor you can notice and a sweet after-taste reminiscent of buttercream frosting. The whole drink gets less harsh to swallow, not to mention that vanilla and whatever the base flavor is *work*. Like, really well.

In fact, they work together *so* well that the combination could be it's own soda, because it has it's own taste, unlike cherry or orange Coke (which just taste like regular Coke with fruits shoved in them).  

The only real downfall to vanilla Coke is that it's not wide-spread; only two stores in my town sell it, which is a huge shame considering how much of a blessing vanilla Coke is.

The double standard makes it okay for women to commit to this kind of behavior, and we dont punish them equally, we're building two different social classes into the law. Why does anyone think its ""just different"" for an older woman to have sex with a male compared for an older man?

https://youtu.be/eM28YFrMdfI?t=9

here's a youtube video of SNL making a joke about male students with female teachers, for instance.

There's actually reasons for making a valid reverse argument based on human development.

Girls mature at 10 and boys have to wait til 20, for some things. (google brain data)

Girls reach maximum (adult) height at 13-15, boys gets a 14-18 period to reach it. Again showing that females mature sooner than males. 

Girls are superior at emotional intelligence to boys, and EI is defined as the ability to read and understand others, their emotions, their thoughts, their intentions, etc. (google again)

Therefore it would seem obvious they'd know more rather than less. Because of all these verifiable facts, a 13 year old boy and 18 year old girl is LEAGUES apart compared to a 13 year old girl and 18 year old boy, which would still be sick and disgusting. Since this case deals with the reverse, and since people are praising him and her, it shows the double standard and unpopularity. It would be unanimous for an older male adult with a young girl to be considered a disgusting pedophile rapist, but on this one people equivocate because the roles are reversed. 

 the double standard throws child-males to the predatory women-wolves.

Neither is acceptable. The double standard simply makes it sickening and worse, especially in light of the fact that it is MALES who are underdeveloped for that age period. If there were a progressive victim stack, MALES should be ahead of FEMALES on the list because of the developmental delay.

Edit: JFC this blew up. 

#edit 2: Omg thanks for the gold guys, I really appreciate it! Omg I also got gilding! Thank you stranger. I am so blessed. I love you!

edit 3: Google the phrase ""science data brain girls mature 10 years"". I dont have time for idiocy, name calling, accusations, threats, etc, any or all of which are completely baseless or trolling. Claiming I'm pro rape and pro pedophilia for denouncing both and also calling science into the equation as why ""its actually WORSE because boys are less mentally developed and thus more easily victimized"" is not support.

Being a piece of shit accuser is something you'll deal with on your own time, not mine.

Go after people in comments who say things like this if you're so triggered and so retarded.

>its absolutely disgusting how warped sexuality has become. your body is not a temple, its a sack of bacteria. sex is not a sacred ritual and nothing is lost when you have sex for the first time. get over yourselves. sex is as common and normal a practice as eating, sleeping and shitting.

>also, id like to know, at what age should one stop being attracted to young people? and i say stop because everyone is attracted to children at some point in their life, usually when they are a child.

>should it also be just as taboo to be 13 and want to fuck a 20 year old? why or why not?

>society does more damage to people based on judgement of a sexual act than the sexual act itself and its disgusting. you should honestly be ashamed of yourself for expressing and enforcing this opinion.

For anyone who needs a heartwarming story after reading the abhorrent positivity towards this situation:

>I live in aus and about 11 years ago I used to be friends with a girl who was obsessed with America, so much so that she signed up to a camp leader in the US for one summer. She went over there an had an inappropriate ‚Äòromance‚Äô with a camp attendee. He was 15 and she was 20. The boys parents found out and had her charged. She went to a women‚Äôs prison in Iowa. Her mother back in aus had to spend 30k on lawyers and fly over to the US to try and get her sent back home. She is now a registered sex offender and has to let every current and future employee know. She is not allowed to work with minors or vulnerable people. She is banned from ever travelling to the US. IMO she got what she deserved.

A bad teacher has a worse influence on society than a drug dealer,30517,cpuofa,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/cpuofa/a_bad_teacher_has_a_worse_influence_on_society/,2064,1565738800.0,"A bad teacher can make hundreds of people hate a subject, or even school, for their whole life. This means while an average drug dealer has bad influence on society and on their clients, if we compare individually ONE teacher and ONE drug dealer, it's debatable if having a bad influence on the education and professional life of hundreds of children is worse or not than selling drugs to a smaller fraction of the people. I think it is.

Furthermore, a child giving up school while young because of a teacher is way more likely to die young or to go to jail, or even to become a drug dealer, which is quite ironic here, because if a bad teacher caused only one dealer, he has had a worse influence than a dealer. For those of you who will say that drug dealers actually kill people when teachers don't, a lot of people turn to drugs (excluding medicinal) in indirect consequence of quitting school, which is not to blame only on teachers, but they should take a part of the blame, and a huge one in some cases

Ps: I am not defending drug dealing, I am just COMPARING it to teachers.

Frankly, I believe that dying of sickness or an accident when you're a young adult (20-35 years old more or less) is way out more brutal.

The child leaves almost nothing behind. It's terrible for the family, that's for sure, but at the same time that person hasn't brought anything to the world yet and most of children don't even know what's happening while they're dying.   On the other hand a young adult leaves friends, sometimes a companion or children. They had something to live for, absolute lucidity on the matter and a half fulfilled life that they will never be able to put a good ending to.

I don't mean to say that children deserve more to die than young adults, that's obvious, but generally speaking I think that the death of a person who already lived half a life and leaves it all behind  is way out sadder than just a kid that has no or very little conscience of what's happening and most of the time does not have something to live for other than the only fact of living.

But lately I've been going to the comments expecting an informative and sincere conversation about a rather serious post only to find (yet again) another 4 pages of jokes or one drawn out and exhausted pun. Sometimes I feel like I should laugh at the cleverness of some. But it happens so often and in so many posts that I find myself never laughing at all in the comments anymore. Not unless there's just a golden moment. I've even begun to roll my eyes the moment I open the comments and see that the top comment is a joke. I NEVER ROLL MY EYES. At anything. 

I used to really connect to reddits sense of humor but lately I've been really turned off by it. Maybe I just need a break.

"I don't care about school shootings, and neither should you.",27547,aswuh3,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/aswuh3/i_dont_care_about_school_shootings_and_neither/,5950,1550741320.0,"Using my backup account for this opinion because why the fuck wouldn't I? If I contended this in public, I'd get mowed down by angry reprimands and disappointed looks. But from an objective and statistical standpoint, it's nonsensical to give a flying fuck about school shootings. Here's why.

&#x200B;

**1,153.** That's how many people have been killed in school shootings since 1965, per [The Washington Post.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/national/mass-shootings-in-america/?utm_term=.094b0180ee3a) This averages out to approximately **23 deaths per year** attributable to school shootings. Below are some other contributing causes of death, measured in annual confirmed cases.

1. **68 - Terrorism.** Let's compare school shootings to my favorite source of wildly disproportionate panic: terrorism. Notorious for being emphatically overblown after 2001, terrorism claimed 68 deaths on United States soil in 2016. This is **three times as many** deaths as school shootings. [Source](https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death)
2. **3,885 - Falling.** Whether it be falling from a cliff, ladder, stairs, or building (unintentionally), falls claimed 3,885 US lives in 2011. The amount of fucks I give about these preventable deaths are equivalent to moons orbiting around Mercury. So why, considering a framework of logic and objectivity, should my newsfeed be dominated by events which claim **169 times less** lives than falling?   [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/nov/06/deaths-mortality-rates-cause-death-2011)
3. **80,058 - Diabetes.** If you were to analyze relative media exposure of diabetes against school shootings, the latter would dominate by a considerable margin. Yet, despite diabetes claiming 80,000 more lives annually (**3480 : 1 ratio**), mainstream media remains fixated on overblowing the severity of school shootings. [Source](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/2017/019.pdf)

&#x200B;

And, just for fun, here's some wildly unlikely shit that's **more likely to kill you** than being shot up in a school.

* **Airplane/Spacecraft Crash** \- 26 deaths
* **Drowning in the Bathtub** \- 29 deaths
* **Getting Struck by a Projectile** \- 33 deaths
* **Pedestrian Getting Nailed by a Lorry** \- 41 deaths
* **Accidentally Strangling Yourself -** 116 deaths

&#x200B;

Now, here's a [New York Times Article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/20/us/school-shootings-drills-risks.html) titled ""*New Reality for High School Students: Calculating the Risk of Getting Shot.*"" Complete with a picture of an injured student, this article insinuates that school shootings are common enough to warrant serious consideration. Why else would you need to calculate the risk of it occurring? What it conveniently leaves out, however, is the following (excerpt from the [Washington Post:](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/school-shootings-are-extraordinarily-rare-why-is-fear-of-them-driving-policy/2018/03/08/f4ead9f2-2247-11e8-94da-ebf9d112159c_story.html?utm_term=.c7e601c50733))

>That means the statistical likelihood of any given public school student being killed¬†by a gun, in school, on any given day since 1999 was **roughly¬†1 in 614,000,000**. And since the 1990s, shootings at schools have been getting less common. The chance of a child¬†being shot and killed in a public school is extraordinarily low.

&#x200B;

In percentages, the probability of a randomly-selected student getting shot tomorrow is 0.00000000016%. It's a number so remarkably small that every calculator I tried automatically expresses it in scientific notation. Thus the probability of a child getting murdered at school is, by all means and measures, inconsequential. There is absolutely no reason for me or you to give a flying shit about inconsequential things, let alone national and global media.",2019-02-21 17:28:40
Trying to force someone into Atheism is just as bad as trying to force someone into Christianity.,27301,a8opp8,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/a8opp8/trying_to_force_someone_into_atheism_is_just_as/,2785,1545543244.0,"I am one of those Atheists who doesn't care what religion people around me practice. I would honestly rather just let people be. I don't think I am more intelligent or better than people who do religion. I have been seeing several threads on Reddit calling everyone who has done religion ""dumb"", ""detached from reality"", etc. Albert Einstein was a Jew, does being an Atheist automatically make us more intelligent than him? No.

And it also makes me cringe when Atheists try to force religious people into Atheism. If we are going to strongly condemn Christians trying to force others into Christianity, we should condemn Atheists trying to force Atheism on to other people.

If it doesn't affect you, just let people be.

Edit: Thanks for bringing Einstein to my attention, with him being ethnically Jewish, growing up in a Jewish family, but not really believing in it too much himself. That being said, intelligent and accomplished people who are religious, do obviously exist. Isaac Newton, someone who was gifted with math but extremely anti-social, was a devout (un-orthodox) Christian. If you don't want to use scientists as an example, James Madison, who wrote the Bill of Rights that is idolized by many, was also Christian.

There needs to be a small dick acceptance movement before I even begin to give a shit about Fat acceptance for women.,27023,a6ekgl,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/a6ekgl/there_needs_to_be_a_small_dick_acceptance/,4772,1544902237.0,"Perhaps this isnt an unpopular opinion, but I'm a bi man who hasn't ever gotten with another man but I talk to gay men a lot. (I've never engaged with it for my own personal reasons but that's besides the point)

I don't think many women realize how fucking horrible it is for a man to have a small dick. How emasculating it is to be judged solely on something that you have absolutely no control over. My size isn't great either but I've come to accept it, however, I know many men who simply can't and most women and society at large do **nothing** to support a person with a small dick. 

When I see all the normal shit about fat acceptance or otherwise loving women no matter what size they are, I laugh because they can fucking *change* their size. A man can't. A woman can get larger breasts, a man can't increase his size. Why should I focus my energy on making those who can change their situation or otherwise in the case of fat people **put themselves in the situation to begin with** feel more comfortable about themselves while those who can't do **anything** to help their situation aren't even fucking mentioned in the mainstream until it's convenient.

The rise in hookup culture is only doing more harm. Many men can't stack up, what's considered ""average"" size is in many cases thought of as small. While it's taboo to shame a woman for their body, small dick jokes seem as if they are completely fair game and the hypocrisy is absolutely disgusting to me.

Edit: as an addendum, I'd like to also take the time to bitch about men with bigger dicks. 

All I can say is fuck most of you. You treat your smaller brothers like shit most of the time. Thinking you're fucking special or you did something to earn your sexual prowess, fuck off. It was luck of the God damn draw you should be getting on your knees and thanking whatever cosmic force responsible for bestowing your prowess unto you. While the rest of the population has to carefully disclose their size to every partner, wondering in the back of their mind if they *truly* don't care. Even though I accept my size (it's about 5 and a half inches) I know I could have it a lot worse and many men do. I still have it in the back of my mind that whoever I'm with isn't actually satisfied with my size like they say they are. I'm glad you fucks don't ever have to deal with that because I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy to be honest. 

**Edit 2: I would like to address some comments and common replies and also give a brief overview of my thoughts thus far.**

I didn't think this was going to blow up like it did. I'm glad it did to be honest because it really put some things in perspective for me. 

Firstly I'd like to address this ludicrous notion that I hate women. I dont know how I can prove to any of you that I dont hate women other than me saying I dont. I may have used harsh words but my words were not to disparage any one group just for existing. My problem was purely with the double standards, with the non-inclusion of men in the mainstream body positive movement. 

I understand and agree that fat acceptance is something we should be concerned about. No one *should* be made to feel horrible about themselves based on their body by other people. My main point was I believe we should be striving for an all inclusive body positive movement that encompasses everyone from burn victims to people with major deformaties, to men and women whom have insecurities. **I never said one couldn't have a fat positive movement.** (despite my disagreements with it due to the unhealthy side effects encouraging obesity can lead to but that's besides the point) I simply *longed for an all inclusive body positive movement* to be pushed just as much if not more than the fat acceptance movement. I get that caring about one thing within a movement doesnt necessarily negate your concern for other issues. But from where I'm sitting it doesnt seem like a lot of men get the same amount of support for their body issues by comparison of women. Perhaps that's just my confirmation bias, and if that's the case I apologize and acknowledge my fault. And before anyone addresses it, I'm not even necessarily advocating for a small dick movement despite the title. That was mostly just for flair and to discuss the notion of body positive movements not including men, and I used penis size as an example. What I really want is inclusivity. Of everyone. 

Another topic I'd like to address is the idea that ""women can't hide the fact that they're fat, men dont broadcast their dick size so it's not as much of a daily struggle by comparison of fat people."" While I understand the logic, I dont really see how its productive. Sexual relationships is a *huge* part of humanity as a whole. Many of us crave it, strive for it. Make it the focus of our daily lives in some cases whether we want to or not. When a person feels inadequate about themselves this can have **major** implications on a persons psyche. If left untreated it can have damaging effects on ones personality and mental state which ultimately harms them on the day to day. I understand that's not a healthy way to go about it, they should be seeking help themselves. But I feel many men are discouraged from talking about it, it's made out to be as if it doesn't matter. Which is why I'm encouraging an all inclusive body positive movement. But I feel the main point those who say this are trying to make is that there's more pressure put on society to accept ones outward appearance that is visible to the naked eye. And I agree with that, but all I'm really saying is we should be reaching higher. 

I obviously can't be the judge of my own character, but I believe I'm a bit of an idealist. For better or worse, I sincerely believe humanity coming together as a whole is not only possible, but necessary for humanity to advance in any meaningful way. Whether it was your intent or not, having a body positive movement that is pushed in the mainstream that is only really geared towards supporting one group can lead to feelings of neglect for another. 

Another topic that was brought up was about my abrasiveness. Many thought I was an asshole in my post and I would agree with that. I admit I'm a bit of a douchebag but that's why I dont want to be the one ""leading the charge"" so to speak. Many suggested that I should start the movement myself, but I'm simply not the right person for the job. I'm hot headed, I sometimes don't think before I speak and many people tend to vehemently disagree with my opinions. I'm a private person, despite how I am online with anonymity, in real life I am a bit of a hermit and have horrible anxiety when placed in uncomfortable positions. I also dont feel it would even be taken seriously given the replies. I see posts of people posting this post on other subs to bitch about it. ""r/unpopularopinion where white men go to whine about shit no one cares about."" I knew there would be opposition to this post and I was prepared for it, but some of the replies honestly make me feel like shit. Perhaps rightly so, because I'm a bit of a dick. But love me or hate me, I stand by most of what I said. 

I sincerely hope that if you take away anything from this, it's that we shouldnt be focusing on advancing one particular group. Supporting one particular group. (Culturally speaking I'm not talking about specific diseases or aggretious physical phenomena) I care about people despite what many of you may believe. And all I really want is peace and acceptance of everybody. (Aside from douchebags who think they're better than everyone else i.e in regards to the first edit about people who flaunt their bigger dicks)

The last major point I'd like to address is many people believe me to be insecure. Somehow me being insecure invalidates the very real lack of support for males in this department. I'll admit that sure, I wish I had a bigger dick. I feel a bit shitty about it at times but for the most part I can tolerate it. I've had partners who didn't care and I genuinely believe them. I know they're out there it's just a matter of finding them. So you can call me an insecure whiny little bitch all you want but you're only proving my point.  

One last thing is I really do appreciate the discussion. There are a lot of points I strongly disagree with that I didn't address here, and there are many ideas I really should think over and reevaluate myself. And I thank  everyone for giving me the opportunity.",2018-12-16 03:30:37

Edit #1: A slight correction on the DDT point. It was only banned worldwide in 2001, but is still used in small quantities to combat large infestations of mosquitoes. It was also linked to several health defects in humans and animals. However, it doesn't change the fact that malaria kills 3000 children every day and that DDT is still the most effective way to combat it, at least in reasonable doses.

It just really annoys the shit out of me. Like I may like guns, BUT at least I respect anyone calling for action against guns. That's action. You're voicing a stance, and that's good.

Cosmo, vogue, fashion shows, reality t.v. Who is really perpetuating the unattainable standards for women to be skinny, to have matching outfits, to wear loads of makeup and possess flashy jewelry. Most guys, in my experience, never complain or even notice shit like that. But every woman I have known talks shit behind other girl's backs or to their face. And a lot of these are impressionable, young girls that drive so much toxicity. 

And if we're talking about gender standards, there has been a huge reverse in standards against men in the last decade. If men even desire a woman to be in shape or presentable, there's an uproar of sexism. But most women are able to have a laundry list of expectations for men and it goes unchecked. Its ludicrous.

TL;DR: Women have unnecessary beauty standards placed on them but it has nothing to do with men. This is toxic femininity and it's dangerous. Sorry this was so long.

Edit: Okay obviously I didn't expect this to blow up as much as it did so I would like to clarify some things. 

1. This thread was not made to bash women whatsoever. I have no control over the comments made here or if they misconstrued my original point. People who are using this as a platform to ridicule women are doing the exact opposite of having a civil debate.

2. I am simply drawing attention to the fact that we as males are told constantly why we are perpetuating toxic masculinity. But there are huge examples of toxic femininity in our society and this is one of them.

3. People refuting this with facts or having a civil discussion, thank you. Those calling me mysogynistic or saying this post is a circle jerk, I think it's important to look outside your bias and see maybe women have A LOT to work on if they want to strive for a less toxic society. It starts with themselves, calling for women to be held accountable is not mysogynistic.",2019-02-09 15:28:29

She was bullied for her disability but her classmates voted her for prom queen.‚Äù or ‚ÄúStar basketball players stands up for his bullied classmate‚Äù. Sure it seems sweet at first but when I think about it all I can see is someone doing something ‚Äúnice‚Äù for their own personal gain. When these stories make the news, who usually gets the most publicity? Who gets the interviews and good press? Why, the people who did the ‚Äúgood deed‚Äù of course. Most of the time it seems like they don‚Äôt give a damn about the person who they did something ‚Äúnice‚Äù for, instead it‚Äôs about ‚ÄúLook what WE did! WE are so nice! WE are so good hearted!‚Äù It‚Äôs all about making themselves feel better when they go to sleep at night, it‚Äôs almost never about the person it should be about. It‚Äôs not sweet and heartwarming, it‚Äôs almost sort of heartbreaking because I‚Äôve seen instances where people will do ‚Äúnice things‚Äù for someone because they take pity on the person and it makes them look good in the eyes of others, but go right back to treating that same person like shit as soon as nobody else is paying attention. It was never about being nice and genuine, it was all a big ego boost. If you want to do something nice do it when nobody‚Äôs looking and don‚Äôt accept any congratulations for your good deed.

ETA: like i said in a reply to a commenter, Sure its a ‚Äúnice thing to do‚Äù and in some cases it makes the disabled person feel good and it‚Äôs a nice gesture all around, BUT disabled people aren‚Äôt mindless angel pets. They have brains and lots of them don‚Äôt like to feel pitied or patronized.

Also if you‚Äôre gonna do something nice for someone make sure you‚Äôre being genuine be consistent with your actions towards someone. Don‚Äôt be nice one day and then cruel the next. I know that all good deeds are a little selfish and that‚Äôs not my main issue here. The motive isn‚Äôt the issue either, it‚Äôs the fact that people see others who happen to have a disability as nothing more than a sad little animal to feel sorry for. Instead of mistreating someone, doing one ‚Äúnice‚Äù thing either because you feel sorry for them or you want wholesomeness clout or both, and then going right back to treating that person like shit; you could be genuine in the first place and treat them like any other human being and maybe even develop a true friendship with them. My issue is the publicity and praise people get for being insincere and inconsistent.

I‚Äôm almost 20 years old and when I was younger I never ran for those positions anyhow.

And you, their human, are doing it for what? To squeeze out a tortured 1 - 5 more years?

They don't understand and they can't consent. Let your beautiful friend enjoy the last few months in peace and then send them off surrounded by their family. You're not trying to save your dog, you're being cruel because you don't want to let go.

EDIT TIME!! Everything above this is the same as when I originally posted it. Below is my addendum. 

So, it has come to my attention that I was pretty misinformed on how pets react to chemo and the purpose of it. Thanks to those of you who were willing to explain without your pitchfork and torch at the ready. [For more information on pets and chemo I went to this site, seems reliable](https://wvrc.com/veterinary-specialties/veterinary-oncology-wi/chemotherapy-general-information/). 

In keeping with the spirit of this sub I'd be willing to alter my unpopular opinion to instead state, ""If your dog has ~~cancer and you opt for chemo~~ *a serious health condition and you opt for expensive treatment*, you're a bad person.""

I know how hard it is so say goodbye to your pet. The reason I think you're a bad person is because you're willing to pay exorbitant medical expenses to extend an animal's life because you don't want to say goodbye, ESPECIALLY in instances when the animal is suffering.

In closing, I get it. Putting your pet down is a VERY personal decision, but I still get to think you're a bad person if I think your reasons are shitty.",2019-07-27 21:45:22
American Colleges shouldn't force you to take classes irrelevant to your career path.,23297,d7yhu7,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/d7yhu7/american_colleges_shouldnt_force_you_to_take/,4304,1569224772.0,"According to my understanding, most of the world doesnt require you to have an undergraduate degree to go into medical school, with their medical school just being 6 years long. In america, to become be in a medical career, you need 8 years of school vs the 6 years at other countries. 


In those 8 years of school, I must take philosophy, sociology, and speech to get an undergraduate in biology. There are *some* classes you can wriggle an argument for, like physics 1 or writing, but probably not physics 2 or speech.



Saying ""colleges just want to make you well rounded"" makes you sound like (and I hate using this term) a sheep. To my understanding, American colleges were more identical to the rest of the world's some time ago. (Not 100% sure on that) So, by saying that colleges want to make you more well-rounded is like saying previous generations of STEM field grads weren't (*or even grads from other countries that is*).  Taking philosophy for 1 semester isn't going to turn my life upside down, not 90¬∞, not 45¬∞, not even 1¬∞.


Edit: ok, I understand and agree that philosophy is important. However, learning that other countries do not require 8 years of education to be in a medical field, makes me irritated at my beloved country. I just used philosophy as pet peeve to get a point across. 1 semester of a particular liberal art feels more like an excuse to siphon money, especially if it is considered vital for an undergraduate that is completely irrelevant. Hell, my school has bio ethics, I haven't taken it yet but that seems like a lovely way to possibly blend philosophy and biology, keeping it relevant. 
 

It honestly feels like colleges just want our money, at the expense of the student's lives. Allowing students 2 more years in their 20s (ideally) and less debt to deal with, can save them so many more problems.",2019-09-23 15:46:12

Instagram is ruining everything (a rant),23229,bgsmm0,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/bgsmm0/instagram_is_ruining_everything_a_rant/,2160,1556127797.0,"I think that Instagram is one of the worst developments in modern culture. Let me explain:

1. **IG is the most shallow of all social media platforms**. While social media platforms like twitter and sometimes even Facebook politically engage people, allow them to connect and organise Instagram is solely based on one person and their looks/life/vacation. No political or important dialogue is happening. I would argue that even Pinterest is more worthwile since at least DIYs teach you something.
2. **IG is all fake but everyone pretends that it's real.** Why we are all pretty much aware from our own Instagram use that these images are usually not what our lives look like all instagram users apparently have this pact that they are just all going to believe each other's bullshit.
3. **IG is bad for your mental health.** Because unrealistic standards are set on Instagram but everyone just pretends like they're real people doing real things it feels like everybody's life is the way it looks in IG. This also creates feelings of inadequacy and is therefore detrimental to especially young people's mental health. (See also this article: [http://time.com/4793331/instagram-social-media-mental-health/](http://time.com/4793331/instagram-social-media-mental-health/)). I also think this applies equally to women and men since the unrealistic standards concerning looks and lifestyle are more than ever directed towards both genders while they previously were more directed towards women as in e.g. advertising.  Additionally, the dopamine rush people get from likes creates an almost addiction-like potential that makes them use the app more and more and making the mental health issues even more pronounced.
4. **IG makes people vain.** Taking pictures of yourself all day makes you the center of your own attention and that leads to ignoring other people and the actual experience you're documenting. It's not about where you went what you ate or what incredible experience you had but only what it looked like and what you looked like doing it. This makes everybody focus more and more on their own appearance and less about things that actually make you a successful human being.
5. **IG gives the worst incentives to people.** The reason I am ranting right now is that I saw a Vice video about a poppy field in California that is killed by people sitting and stepping on it to take pictures predominantly for Instagram (Video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxUrr-CIgkA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxUrr-CIgkA)). They then talked to the people taking the pictures asking them why they're doing it and their answers made me incredibly angry. Some people were open about just wanting likes but some others pretended like they were really concerned about the flowers talking about ""the feeling of being one with nature"". So these people want to signal to others that they love nature and the beauty of it while literally destroying the natural habitat and the flowers. This shows that they really don't care about anything at all except their likes on a goddamn picture. Now I don't think that they are inherently bad people but I think that Instagram actively gives them an incentive to be this way fuelled by the addictive potential of the platform and the likes you get from it.

I would encourage anyone reading this to please examine how much time you spend on Instagram and if you get anything from it than a simple dopamine rush and feelings of inadequacy and think of what you could do that's more meaningful and actually makes you happy.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

EDIT: A lot of people are posting that they follow artists, architects, blacksmiths etc. and use Instagram predominantly in a small community or niche. So just to clarify, I do think that one can use Instagram positively and get a lot of good content from it. What I wanted to point out in my post is the culture that evolved around instagram and especially individual people posting nothing but their lives. And while some of you are so blessed as to not experience this culture in your everyday lives I feel like for others the posting ""cute"" pictures of oneself is a crucial part of social life e.g. kids in middle/high school. I do think that every social media platform can be great since it really depends on the users and what they post. However, I feel that while some good Instagram accounts exist the majority is selfies, vacation and food pictures and that this makes some people feel that they to share this much of their lives as well.",2019-04-25 01:43:17

If someone gets murdered with a hammer are you going to sue the hammer company because their hammer was used to kill somebody ?  (hammer murders are actually common apparently) 

If someone drinks and drives and kills someone are you going to sue the alcohol company ? Or the maker of the car ?  

You can't help what some crazy person does. And everyone else shouldn't be punished for someone else's wrong doing. 

If I sell someone a pen and then they turn around and stab someone to death with that pen , am I at fault ?

No they don't.  So the company that makes said forks and pencils shouldn't be punished for it ,  nor should everyone else be prevented from owning those ""forks"" and ""pencils"" because someone else mis-uses them.

There aren't even a lot of communities with over a million subscribers, if the admins wanted to clean out the moderators and bring in new people it wouldn't take much work at all.

Life would be better without sexual desire,21237,buqkmh,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/buqkmh/life_would_be_better_without_sexual_desire/,3059,1559232821.0,"Sex make life a lot more complicated than it has to be, and ultimately sex is more trouble than it is worth. 

Sex makes people objectify others, hate others for their sexual orientation, and act irrationally. The most intimate moments between two people should be during a conversation, not when one is slamming into the other. Two people can be driven apart by sexual incompatibility even if everything else checks out.

If humans did not have an overwhelming compulsion to have sex, mankind would be much better off. And it's unfortunate that they do.

EDIT: 

I'm seeing a lot of two particular comments, and I'd like to address them because they are repetitive and make untrue assumptions. 

 **There would be no people without sexual desire** 

That might have been true in the Stone Age, but we have IVF now if you don't want to do the act. Perhaps the birth rate would go down if people suddenly had no desire to have sex tomorrow, but that would also eliminate almost all unwanted children. At any rate, my suggestion is that it would be better (as some has figured out) if people evolved beyond having to reproduce because of sexual desire. Obviously, if we rewind human history to its origins, there would be no people without sexual desire, and I will concede that.

 **Sex is responsible for the closeness between couples**

I don't deny that sex can make two people close because of the hormones involved, but I don't think that makes sexual desire worth it when you consider the negatives I mentioned. Plato believed that love between brothers was more sincere than the love between sexual partners because it was there without lust, and I agree with that.

EDIT 2: 

I've noticed a third item that should also be addressed.

**The motivation of men to do anything is so they can get laid**

There are probably thousands of counterexamples to this, but the first one that comes to mind is the work of Michelangelo, This is a gay guy who never allowed himself to have sex or really any physically intimate contact with other men. One of the greatest artists of all time, despite the fact that he obviously wasn't working toward the goal of getting laid, because that was never on the table for him.",2019-05-31 00:13:41
"""You can't complain because x person has it worse"" is a really toxic idea.",21214,b4xfmt,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/b4xfmt/you_cant_complain_because_x_person_has_it_worse/,957,1553469475.0," Let me preface this by saying I do believe in being grateful for what you have. But there's a difference between that and using this argument to shut people up. I hate this for several reasons.

1. The people who say this almost never have it worse. They are usually putting words in the mouths of another group of people. I have a disability that limits my ability to walk. I don't complain about it much but I've been told not to because there are other people more disabled than me. I'm aware of that, but I've never been told this by someone who wasn't able bodied.

2. By the logic of this argument, the only people who are allowed to complain are dead or on the verge of death.

3. Complaining solves problems. Now, I can't speak for everyone with a disability, but I personally don't mind if an able bodied person complains about pain, as long as they let me do the same. In fact, I'm probably the best person you can complain to. I've had nerve and muscle pain for a long time and I grew up around lots of healthcare professionals, if you have pain, I might be able to help. 

4. Also prevents heart attacks because you let stress out when you complain. So even if it doesn't directly solve your problem, it lets off steam. Look it up.

5. Those people that actually have it worse aren't helped by my silence any more than they are by my complaints. Considering point 3, my complaining might actually help if I do it right. After all, isn't that what protesting is? Complaining on your own behalf or on the behalf of others to solve a problem? 

6. It's used to silence people who need help. I don't think I need to explain this part, you get it. 

7. It's human nature to complain. It just is. 

Just something I had to get off my chest, thanks.

Breeders don't give a shit about your car or dog, they don't care if they die years earlier than they should, or if they're prone to more diseases and health issues, they care about is your cash.

Of course I don't mean all breeds of animals when I say they should be bred out, but here are some examples of breeds I do mean:

French Bulldogs, Pugs, and other brachycephalic dog breeds: These dogs are often characterised as cute, with flat faces, but this causes their problems. Being bred to a point that their skulls are the wrong shape, causing lots of health problems, most notably breathing issues.

Munchkin Cats: Munchkin cats are dwarf cats, sausage cats, whatever you want to call them, are genetically bred to be dwarfs. If they had no health risks, I still think this is cruelty to cats, as it restricts what they were capable of. But, they have been reported to have higher instances of pectus excavatum (Hollowed chest), and lordosis (Curved spine).

This isn't even hard to achieve. Simply put a ban on breeders breeding these types of animals, and spay / neuter all the ones that are already owned / being sold.

But I doubt we'll do this for a long time, because so many people adore their horribly deformed pets that have resulted from shitty breeders.

This happens because when you share these unpopular opinions; your comments get hidden making it harder for people to listen to what you say, especially for new users without much karma it can very easy to get banned, and users with unpopular opinions face a very hostile reaction in those subreddits.

Unfortunately there is an easy alternative, where you run to a subreddit which is the complete opposite, the majority agrees with you on your statements, you have the support of the community and positive reinforcement where people encourage you on.

This is poor for dicussion for many reasons but undoubtedly the most important is that people aren't as challenged on their ideas and beliefs drastically lowering the overall quality of discussion.

I would argue that my position is a minority argument and that most redditors would instead put the discussion problem down to the nature of argument on the site being very reactionary, with relatively little knowledge on the given subject matter.

More of a mild to aggressive weirded outness at guys who use their homosexuality as a staging ground for obtusely bizarre, exaggerated feminine behavior (girls mostly do not act like this version of feminine either lol).

I have this opinion because I live in a 3rd world country and I've seen some shit and some irresponsible people have children just to make them work on the streets from a very young age without even providing them with the basics.

I've seen people who live in cardboard houses not accepting any form of birth control cause ""that's not what god would want"" and having 6 to 10 children (I'm not even kidding) living in poor conditions and 0 opportunities, and getting to their teenage years only to start that cycle again and again. And no one does anything because is their ""right"" to have children.",2019-08-26 21:48:57

- aviable to everyone above 18 years of age
- free

- one has to go through a ""resocialization"" program
- programm tries to re-establish the will to live, through learning new skills, finding work, meeting people, etc 
-> fixing the person's problems

If after 6 months no ""resocialization"" is reached, the person will get the assisted suicide

A much needed edit:
- The time limit has been selected ""randomly"" and is a placeholder
- the ""resocialization"" Programms goal is to get the person into a state of willingness to live, by solving the person's problems, be it by therapy or some other way
- the free aspect seems to irritate some people who don't want to fund it with their tax, how about funding it with the taxes from rich people/corporations instead?

You've probably also read or even argued that it's because marriage between 2 people is ""outdated"" or ""unnatural"" and humans aren't supposed to tie themselves to just 1 person.

  
This is just an excuse we've given ourselves to be lazy and selfish about our commitments. The reason marriages and relationships fail so often now is people think they'll find their ""soulmate"" - and once they find this perfect, special soulmate, they'll get married and live happily ever after like some sort of Disney fairytale. What a joke. But this is really ingrained in our culture. Think hard and take an honest look, and you'll probably realize it's ingrained in you, too.

&#x200B;

The fact is, marriage - even marriages between extremely good and compatible people - take hard work. They take commitment. They take sacrifice, honesty, and humility.

What does it mean to put work and sacrifice into your marriage?

\*It means... not scrolling through the Facebook or IG pages of your ex-lovers or old crushes. Saying ""no"" to silly thoughts like ""if I was with this other guy/girl....things would be perfect.""

\*It means... not giving yourself excuses to step out on your wife or husband. ""She/he was mean to me."" ""I deserve this."" ""She doesnt love me anyway. I can sleep with someone else now."" - Nope. you made a commitment. Stick by it and work on your issues.

\*It means... putting down the video games, the TV controller, the football game, the beer bottle, etc. and instead doing something nice for your spouse, such as the dishes or cleaning out the car. 

\*It means... not using your intimate knowledge of the other person to inflict pain and harm on them during arguments, but instead holding back and learning to express your frustration in a healthy way that doesnt cause severe damage to the relationship.

&#x200B;

These are just a few examples of things I see so often that kill marriages. The truth is that marriage between 2 people can be amazing and last a lifetime, but you have to work hard at it and ignore a lot of what our selfish, hyper-consumer culture tells us about how to behave.",2019-03-06 13:23:32

John Lennon was a piece of crap person and a piece of crap singer who doesn't deserve the hype around his life.,19061,b2697p,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/b2697p/john_lennon_was_a_piece_of_crap_person_and_a/,1697,1552865223.0,"He was a known wife beater who often flew into uncontrollable fits of rage that he directed to the various women in his life.  Lennon resented his son Julian, and narcissisticly blamed the boy for a marriage he did not want to be in. After Lennon divorced his wife, he took off with Yoko Ono and dropped out of his son‚Äôs life for years. Julian has stated that Paul McCartney was far more of a father to him than John ever was. 

John was a pathological liar who claimed he had been raised in a working class family in Liverpool when he was actually raised in a comfortable upper middle class home. He often claimed to be single during his early years of stardom, despite being married. He claimed to have met Yoko Ono at an art show; falling in love at first sight, when in fact, Ono had stalked him for months before he gave in to her.

John claimed to have lost interest in the Beatles due to Paul McCartney‚Äôs tendencies toward pop music when in fact, he had spent two years in a daze as a result of a serious addiction to heroin. Together, he and Yoko  destroyed the Beatles, then he blamed the breakup on Paul McCartney. 

He was politically clueless and gave money to publicity violent and radical groups such as the Black Panthers.

He was no better than an average guitar player who mostly confined his playing to the basic rhythm parts and his piano playing was amateurish. 
His song writing was no better;  The lyrics to Strawberry Fields Forever and Come Together are pure drug induced hippie psychedelic babble.

Lennon was a raging hypocrite who lived the do as I say, not as I do life perhaps more flamboyantly than anyone. All you have to do is look at his songs. Lennon, who sang Imagine no Possessions lived a millionaire‚Äôs life in a posh New York hotel.  Lennon sang Imagine no Religion, while he was was obsessed with every spiritual and New Age fad that came along, including Hindu meditation, the I-Ching, and astrology of all kinds.  And it was Lennon who sang All you need is Love, yet lived a violent, and angry life while abusing his family and friends. And it was Lennon who sang about having nothing to kill or die for helped finance radical and violent political groups.

Lennon was a piece of shit and the world should know this about him.

You need to talk to someone. You should talk to a therapist. You should call this hotline. 

You think they haven‚Äôt fucking thought of that? No shit. It‚Äôs the first thing anyone says when someone is depressed; you should talk to a therapist.

Honestly? I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a way to measure it, but if someone calls that hotline I don‚Äôt think they were going to do it anyways (other than the ones that called it and did it on the call).

It‚Äôs just annoying to me that when people say they‚Äôre depressed and society sucks, and they joke about (or are serious about) killing themselves, no one ever offers real solutions but just says ‚Äúcall this random number and talk to someone, oh I just know how you feel I‚Äôve been there before‚Äù


Edit: this seems split in terms of popularity. I‚Äôm gonna take this time to lay out what worked for me. Feel free to tell me I‚Äôm an idiot, but I swear to god this worked for me. You know what pulled me out of my slump? Realizing all of these other styles of help were bullshit, and that it was entirely my own mental state. If I was going to get out of it, I was going to have to be the one to make changes. At face value it sounds silly, but I really internalized this idea. I forced myself to stop relying on other people for my own happiness. It made me a more cynical person towards society as a whole, but damnit if it didn‚Äôt help I don‚Äôt know what did. Realizing society‚Äôs shortcomings were what put me in that place to begin with made me understand that in order to overcome, I was going to be the only one that could truly change my own personal mental well being. I took this mentality to heart, and started focusing on things like hobbies. It wasn‚Äôt easy, but I spent my time learning to do things like play guitar, or build circuits, or get really good at a certain video game, or produce beats, etc. This idea may be a crock of shit, but I gave this advice to another one of my depressed friends telling them I thought the advice people generally give is bullshit. I actually found that giving a bleak response of understanding and being real with them and not being all ‚Äúyeah, talk to someone!‚Äù Etc. was more helpful. If you can actually relate to how that depressed person feels instead of just telling them everything will be okay, you have a better chance of helping. They don‚Äôt want to hear ‚Äúeverything is okay‚Äù, they want to hear ‚Äúyeah you‚Äôre right everything really is fucked.‚Äù If you can truly relate to them and the way they feel without trying to tell them how to fix it explicitly, they‚Äôll appreciate it.

Edit 2: I should have been more explicit when I wrote this. I'm sure hotlines help some people, I'm not saying they don't. I'm also not saying therapy doesn't help people.

Edit 3: Here's an analogy. Your friend is in a hole (depression). You're standing outside of the hole. You're shouting phone numbers down into the hole and saying things like ""you're gonna be fine, it's okay"".

I‚Äôm tired of the racism and heterophobia coming from ‚Äúwoke‚Äù POC and LGBTQ+ communities,18602,a32qn4,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/a32qn4/im_tired_of_the_racism_and_heterophobia_coming/,2179,1543973056.0,"I‚Äôm a pansexual black/Cuban poet who has been doing slam poetry for 5 years. Throughout these 5 years I‚Äôve seen so many people who swore they were ‚Äúwoke‚Äù proceed to do a poem that isn‚Äôt much more than hating white people and bashing straight people. At the end of these poems, most POC go insane with applause, and the white people in the room all clap along too, even though they‚Äôve done nothing but try to be an ally. 

This kind of behavior can be seen on social media too.  A person of color can post anything about white people. They can post anything from a joke that uses white people as the punch line to straight up saying ‚ÄúI hate white people‚Äù and be fine. Same thing with queer people and straight people. 

And I get it. I‚Äôm Black, Cuban, queer, and a woman. I‚Äôm made up of two races that have been enslaved, tortured, and shunned. My gender has been put down for centuries. I would‚Äôve had to force myself into the closet if I was born a couple of centuries earlier. I know what it‚Äôs like to be hated for who I am. I know what it‚Äôs like to feel angry for what‚Äôs been done to my ancestors, and my queer brothers, sisters, and siblings. But I don‚Äôt compliment these poems. I don‚Äôt applaud. I don‚Äôt like these posts. Because it‚Äôs wrong. This is the same kind of ignorant hate being flung by the homophobes and racists on the other end. This is all just tit for tat. 

You‚Äôre not woke if you:

- Make racist/ sexist/ straight bashing jokes and can‚Äôt take it back in your direction. 

-Use generalizations like ‚Äúall white people‚Äù or ‚Äúall straight people‚Äù but then get mad when someone uses generalizations like ‚Äúall black people‚Äù or ‚Äúall queer people. 

-Refuse to talk or communicate with someone simply because they‚Äôre a white straight cis man but then feel angry that someone doesn‚Äôt want to interact with you because you‚Äôre a queer person of color. 

-Push allies away when they‚Äôre trying to help you. 

-Think you‚Äôre better than anyone because of your identity. 

Everyone has the right to be who they want. To be proud of their identity. You have no control over what you are and who you are and you shouldn‚Äôt be hated and put down for it. But you shouldn‚Äôt put another person down just to lift yourself up. 

Next time you write a status or a poem about the ‚Äúother‚Äù side, insert blanks on every time you name them. Insert something represents you into the blanks. Then read the poem and visualize someone from the ‚Äúother‚Äù side reading it back to you. Do you feel put down? That‚Äôs what you‚Äôre doing to others. 


TLDR: Love yourself but don‚Äôt put other people down in the process.

The absence of a dislike button on Facebook warps public opinions on some serious matters, and I believe it also influences peoples own opinions.   


The only way to counter a comment you don't agree with or are offended by is to put an Angry emoji or comment. The angry emoji is misleading and is often used to demonstrate your dislike of the subject at hand and not the comment itself. Commenting just opens up arguments, abuse and takes time. Giving people a 'dislike' option, very much like the down vote system on here would change this...  


Imagine being a generally ignorant, racist, bigoted idiot and commenting something obscene online? You might post a comment that really offends 18,000 out of 20,000 people, but it shows 2k likes by like minded idiots. This sends out the wrong message. This tells people who are just passing that the opinion is popular, there is a lack of balance without the effort of commenting and getting involved in a spat. Add the dislike function and suddenly the comment has 2k likes but 18k dislikes, which tells people that this is an unpopular view point and might make people think twice about what they say, or take a rain check on their attitudes.  


It would give people the freedom to disagree without engaging, it would add balance to the site, and considering how much political debate there is on there at the moment, I think it is IMPORTANT.

I would rather kick myself in the balls than own ANYTHING with a cannabis leaf drawn on it, wether it's shirt, a hat, an ashtray, a rolling tray, a poster a tattoo, a bong or a fucking sticker. People whose apparent jobs are to smoke weed on YouTube make me sick and if you look at recipes for edibles they will invade your reccomended videos.

 I went to a legal shop here in Montreal and left slmost immediately due to the overwhelming douche baggery happening in there. They turned Bob Marley, a man who sang songs of love and unity, and turned him into a mass marketed caricature who seemed to have only cared about weed. Every mention of 420 makes me roll my eyes, if anything, Canadians should celebrate 10/17 (the day cannabis was legalized federally). And dealers in general are insufferable weed snobs.

 Every dealer I have had until my current suppliers have been arrogant douchebags who try and tell you you are ""smoking wrong"" and think they are your friends. I know it's shitty to bag on how people enjoy things but weed culture makes all cannabis users looks immature, lazy and stupid.

I notice that my acquaintances and friends who tend to be very accomplished people, and are the epitome of the successful man tended to be some of the realest and most genuine people around me. For example the traits they shared would be: athletic accomplishments in sports, lifting, strong career and academic goals, involvement in clubs and student activities (both in HS and college), traveling, open mindedness, self created good appearance (due to taking care of self and clothing), and humble/positive personalities. I‚Äôve had lab mates who went to Oxford and Harvard who I wouldn‚Äôt have even suspected gone to such schools, because when you talk to them,  they wanted to know about you and really laid back people. You know they‚Äôre awesome people from just the way they carry themselves.

I had former friends and acquaintances who were the opposite. For example one example of a former close I had was somebody who barely got through high school and participated in nothing back then. After, he would be extremely stubborn about getting a job, going to a job training program, or putting himself in positions to meet new people, ect. His ass was just sitting around broke and always creating drama with other people, while mooching off others. He did not work out much, yet bragged constantly about his childhood accomplishments, claiming to have played 10 different sports. He always talked about being alpha and tried to act like the top dog around others. People initially are drawn to his charm and good social skills, but over time they see the truth that he‚Äôs just a total loser. In the neighborhood I grew up with there were a lot of people like the one guy I described above.

Naming accused brings few benefits besides other victims/witnesses potentially coming forward and warning the public while the trial is under way. Obviously due to the nature of the crime, each cases is different and exceptions will apply. However with many details of trials hidden, the general public tends to make their decision if the accused is guilty based upon very little evidence.

Unattractive people should learn to accept that they‚Äôre not attractive rather than delude themselves that they are.,16351,c2gs0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/c2gs0p/unattractive_people_should_learn_to_accept_that/,3253,1560977889.0,"‚ÄúEverybody is beautiful to somebody.‚Äù 

‚ÄúUgly doesn‚Äôt exist.‚Äù

‚ÄúLooks don‚Äôt even matter. What‚Äôs on the inside determines whether you‚Äôre attractive or not.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre perfect just the way you are.‚Äù 


These quotes amongst many others are constantly fed to unattractive people. It‚Äôs like everyone needs to believe they‚Äôre attractive or else. God forbid anyone ever see themselves as less-than-beautiful. 

But... why? Is being unattractive THAT bad? Is attractiveness a person‚Äôs only value to humanity? Are the lies necessary?

Sure, in a utopia, everybody would be attractive to everybody and no one would be considered ugly. But alas, this is planet earth and life isn‚Äôt fair. Some people are born with attractive features; some are not. Some are born with blatantly unattractive features. Yes, that‚Äôs nobody‚Äôs fault, but that‚Äôs just the way it is. 

Before you say ‚Äúbeauty is subjective‚Äù, you can‚Äôt deny that certain features are innately and universally attractive to human beings. For men they would be tall height, broad shoulders, full hair, clear skin, and facial symmetry+harmony. For women: clear skin, full hair, hairlessness, facial symmetry+harmony, and a good waist-hip ratio. Aside from certain fetishists, I‚Äôve yet to meet a man or woman who did not strongly prefer these features and dislike their opposites. 

Not only would people stop lying to themselves if they accepted their unattractiveness; they would no longer have to wonder ‚Äúwhat am I doing wrong?‚Äù when they find that others don‚Äôt view them how they view themselves.",2019-06-20 04:58:09

You are their caretaker, you control most of what they eat, and you control their physical activity to a great extent. 

If your child gets to the point where their weight starts to cause health problems you should be charged with child abuse and have your child taken away.

You're letting them learn eating habits that are going to cause them to likely be fat their entire life, putting them at a higher risk for a long list of serious health issues. 

Edit: I'm gonna try and address some reoccurring comments here. 

I understand that (at least in the States) a lot of the time it is cheaper to buy junk food, but this isn't a good argument because you can still lose weight with junkfood. For the overwhelming majority of people weight loss comes down to calories in being fewer than calories out. 


And on taking kids away from parents I agree there should be some steps before that happens. There should be serious health impacts before this happens, and some kind of intervention in the form of a diet/exercise plan given to the family to follow. But if you're gonna let your kid get diabetes at 16 then yea, they should be taken away.

What I am talking about is any act she willingly performed for an ex that she either enjoyed or was at least indifferent to (i.e. She had no negative feelings about it).

&#x200B;

There are two main reasons for this behavior and neither of them are good.

&#x200B;

The first reason could be that her ex is more important to her than you. He is so important that even though the relationship is over, there are still things that she wants to reserve as only being for him and, in her mind, giving those things to you would feel like cheating. I know, crazy right?

&#x200B;

The second reason could be that she is less attracted to you than she was to her ex. You are second best in her estimation; good enough to date, but not good enough to give all that she has to offer. Does that sound like a desirable relationship to be in???

&#x200B;

Now, Reddit is filled with easily triggered women and the whitest of knights who have this magical ability to read things that were never typed, so let's make some thing's clear:

&#x200B;

1. No guy is entitled to sex from a girl just because she is his girlfriend, but no girl is entitled to a relationship with a guy she won't fuck.
2. I'm not saying that a guy should say ""Do this for me, or I'm leaving."" I'm saying that, once he finds out that she's holding out on him sexually, he should move on. That relationship is toxic, and you can be sure that sex isn't the only thing she's keeping from him.
3. This obviously goes both ways and pertains to more things than just sex, I only picked men and sex because I tend to hear about that situation more often.
4. Obviously not suggesting that the girl should be forced to do anything she doesn't want to do.
5. If both the guy and the girl are refusing to give each other things that they willingly gave their ex's, then I guess it's a match made in heaven.

Another guy had an ex that wouldn't do anal, but she talked about doing it with an ex and how much she liked it.

Toxic Femininity is worse than Toxic Masculinity,15069,cpamyk,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/cpamyk/toxic_femininity_is_worse_than_toxic_masculinity/,5021,1565635145.0,"In recent years we have seen a rise in complaints relating to the behaviour of men and how it can be construed as toxic. The current movements have brought a deeper focus towards this and have created changes, some for the better and some for the worse. But during this time the very people marching against man have completely ignored their own toxic behaviours and a failure to address these would be worry some. Women seem to want equality, but do not want to change their own bad behaviours.

When you think of toxic masculinity you are primarily speaking about mansplaining, manspreading, sexual violence or the boys will be boys argument. The whole movements seems to target the role of men as the dominant sex.

&#x200B;

But when you look at toxic femininity there is a much wider scope of problems that show up. A lot of toxic behaviours can easily outweigh most of what these people consider to be toxic masculinity. A few examples being;

* Blaming behavioural issues on periods
* Acting helpless at times where some physically demanding or unpleasant task comes up
* Coercing men into sex who didn't seem to really want it and feeling as though you were at liberty to do so because ""men always want it""
* Backed up by studies, women are far more likely to threaten harm to themselves, others or property if a man attempts to leave a relationship
* Being physically abusive to men while expressing ""men can't hit women"" and being less likely to face any legal consequences for doing so
* Lying about pregnancies or being on birth control to see how a man would respond or to manipulate them into staying
* Manipulating divorce and custody battles by falsely insisting that a man has been abusive to you or a child.

&#x200B;

Some of these examples are minor toxic offences, like blaming bad behaviour on hormones. It's normal, it happens, but it is no excuse all the same. Some of these examples are major toxic offences. Such as using your gender or children as a weapon to influence decision to go your way.

One of the most common offences of toxic femininity is attempting to convince the world that toxic femininity does not exist.

Resulting from that mess was the brief conversation that happened around the interwebs, on the opinion pages of news sites, and probably a good amount of interpersonal conversations as well. 

The conversation went as such: If you're afraid of a false rape accusation landing on you, you're wrong to do so because it's so rare, and you're a shitty person to do so because that means you don't care about women. Furthermore, even men who *are* falsely accused of rape rarely see jail time anyways!

Yeah. No shit. The reason being is that the biggest way to determine if an accusation is false is if there is *undeniable evidence despite the accuser stating otherwise* (which is rare) **OR** *the accuser confesses that the accusation was false* (which is usually the case). So... of course the legal system will not give charges based on a *certifiable false statement.* 

What ISN'T outlined about rape accusations is the majority of them are closed because there is no evidence to support *either* scenario. The implication in providing the ""they're really rare"" statistic was it *implied the remaining allegations were true.* In effect, it was a lie by omission. 

And the above really isn't my point anyways. Here's the main point:

*In a false accusation, the false accuser is rarely punished. There are very little, if any, repercussions to a false female rape accuser if she's found to be lying.*

So, why should a woman be scared to make a false allegation if *his life is going to be fucked up from it and hers isn't, even if she's caught in the lie?* Where's the deterrent there? 

Another question that I have never once seen given a good answer:

How does a man prove verbal, unrecorded consent to sex? This is how *most* consent occurs anyways. Other than his word, what defense does he have to a woman stating that the sex turned into rape? Throw in radical feminism's insistence that consent can be revoked at any time, *even after sex*, then what men are looking at is a fucking legal minefield that has this as a sign at the front of it: Intimacy with a Woman. 

We have no defense, she gets no consequences..... and people are baffled as to why men, especially young men, are terrified of this? 

Lastly: I want to be wrong. 

Here's what you can do if I am: treat me as someone who has been lied to, and **prove why that's the case**, without being a piece of shit about it. try and see if you can avoid calling me an ""incel"" as that is the current insult in this regard I've found. 

I'm not saying this to guard against my delicate sensibilities, but rather know that I am *nowhere close* to being alone here. Relentless condescension, name-calling, and accusations are only going to do one thing with the growing number of men who are convinced they're right: it'll reinforce their position, and you won't even see them in the comments. You won't even see them outside the walls of a public conversation, or a heated exchange on Facebook. Talk to *them,* not *me...* in this case here on Reddit at least.  

So, if I am wrong, convince the people not leaving comments, the ones listening, that I am... and see if you can do it in a way that doesn't make *you* look like part of *another* growing demographic: someone who doesn't even give a shit and could care less about men's concerns and fears.

Obviously I'm not going to double down on using it if it truly does bother somebody. I'm not an asshole.

I mixed up the words *petulant* and *pustulent,* but the two words do sound somewhat similar. Obviously the reasons *pustulent* and *hemorrhage* are gross sounding is because of what they mean. I'm not going to avoid them if I need to use either.",2019-03-26 15:49:13

"Schools need to teach kids about acne, weight gain, showering, and inform them about what conditions we bully people for way more than we need half assed anti-bullying campaigns that do nothing.",14572,b01szd,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/b01szd/schools_need_to_teach_kids_about_acne_weight_gain/,751,1552383237.0,"You have no idea how many kids think that acne is just a matter of washing your face or that they're just to lazy to get medication, or even that anything on the face is either acne or herpes. So many kids get bullied for something that 80% of people go through. Acne is almost exclusively caused by hormones, and while washing twice daily (or possibly three if it's extremely greasy) can help *if proper cleaners are used* it won't get rid of it for most people. I had sensitive skin, like extremely sensitive, many people do, and I had tried about 20 different medications and washes and all of them burned until I cried so I was forced to give up, not to mention that was a HUGE expense every month some families might not be able to spare. Different things work for different people, sometimes nothing works. Turns out I didn't even have acne. I have a very common condition called KP, that looks like acne (causes redness, bumps, small ""whiteheads"" that are actually filled with keratin not pus) and has no cure or good treatment other than just growing out of it. Eating different foods has no effect on your acne as long as your overall diet is healthy. If you have good quality make-up it won't cause acne, some are even made to help. I could go on forever about myths that nobody knows, at least not until it's to late for them and those who they may have bullied.

Weight gain for many kids is again not their fault. Their parents aren't providing a healthy diet. These kids essentially have an addiction. The majority of kids who are overweight are eating that way due to stress. Bullying has made them afraid of the gym, locker rooms, gym class, just excersize in genderal. Also many people who may look overweight can be of perfectly fine BMI and extremely healthy. Not saying the fat acceptance ""there's no such thing as obese"" is true, just that what we see isn't always right, and nobody deserves to get bullied for what is more than likely not their fault.

I knew a kid who never showered, it was because nobody taught him how to really scrub his hair or use shampoo, and he was in foster care so nobody taught him. Same went for washing clothes, brushing teeth, using deodorant, while they seem rather evident to most of us, some families can't afford it and some kids simply don't have any family to learn it from. 

All in all, bullying largely comes from lack of knowledge and understanding. I'm pretty sure that if we simply taught kids about their own bodies in a way that went past ""here's how to probably not get a girl pregnant"" and ""this is a vegetable"" we would highly reduce bullying. Did you know the average woman dislikes her breasts and 80% would get surgery? It is beyond normal to have slightly lopsided boobs, to have large areolas, inverted nipples, the ""average"" breast is in no way a perfect. Did you know that the average man isn't capable of getting a six pack, that it is completely normal to have a slight fat buildup in your chest? We often don't talk about the unrealistic body expectations for men, but in no way whatsoever is the average man running around out there with enough muscle deffinition to look like he's made of cobblestone.

If you are pregnant and intend on carrying and birthing that child, you have a moral and ethical responsibility to make sure that baby is born as healthy as possible. It should be illegal for any woman to drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes while she‚Äôs growing a developing fetus. 

It should be punishable as felony child abuse or neglect if the child is born with any deformities or developmental issues related to the substance abuse (this is provable with medical expertise), and charged as a misdemeanor if not.

If your child is obese (outside of medical reasons) it should be considered child abuse.,13940,akmrbx,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/akmrbx/if_your_child_is_obese_outside_of_medical_reasons/,1223,1548705452.0,"
IMO a Dr or teacher should be able to contact CPS for an investigation if a (young) child is morbidly obese. 

Last night I saw 2 small children, brother and sister, who looked around 5 and 8 years old who were both massively overweight. It broke my heart to see them struggling to play, breathing heavily, and see their overweight mom hand then candy bars and chips. 

I don't know their circumstances and for the most part, I am indifferent to other's choices in raising their children. However, there is no reason a child that age should be obese (aside from a medical condition). A child that age is not in control of what they are given to eat and if you as their parent are over-feeding them junk to the point of childhood obesity, some sort of child abuse should be suggested. 

These poor kids have to grow up with the consequences of your bad eating habits and you are setting them up for health problems later in life. 

Edit: Thank you for mentioning the factors I naively missed such as poverty, the effects of corporations targeting children, and people who don't know better. These points are very valid and make a lot of sense. Perhaps if counselors, teachers, doctors had the ability to become more involved in extreme situations (as some can with underweight, starving children) this could be a good place to start. 

I had no idea this was a ""re-post"". 

As anyone, I am speaking from my own experience and I did come from a family who struggled with money. I don't know how my parents managed to keep our meals balanced. 

 I think we need positive ideas of ways we can help prevent this problem. My Doctor's office has material for families about healthy eating. I have seen free ""classes"" offered in the community for families about healthy eating. 

Edit 2: I remembered more of our eating habits as a child. We had a garden, my dad's friend gave him grain that we ground up in a vitamix for flour, we ate a lot of rice, beans, veggies. We also spent a lot of time outside. All in all, EDUCATION is a huge influencer and EFFORT makes a difference!

Also for the love of God everyone saying this is a popular opinion should read the comments because a good portion disagree with me. Yay for a lively debate!",2019-01-29 03:57:32
"Reddit is not a bastion of free speech, and is actually highly censored by the wrong people.",13887,a1yvpj,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/a1yvpj/reddit_is_not_a_bastion_of_free_speech_and_is/,3053,1543658650.0,"Hear me out.

I originally came here because I heard that Reddit was built upon free speech and free thinking. That was a lie.

Subreddit communities can make lists of rules and whatnot to make clear what kind of things they don't want on their sub, and that's okay.

The problem with the rules and independent moderation of Reddit is that, subs are just using their lists of rules as generalizations which in turn become excuses to censor people who don't agree with them. 

Generally, once you start talking about things that rustle the mods' jimmies, they will ban you. It doesn't matter if you've broken one of their rules or not, they'll just pick the rule they think is closest to what you're saying and use that as their excuse. Worse yet, sometimes they don't even give a reason, or they flat out admit they just don't like what you're saying. 

Most moderators just want safe spaces. They usually don't even want a safe space for their audience, they just want safe spaces for themselves, because god forbid you post something they disagree with in their subreddit, whether  you're breaking the rules or not, they'll find a reason to get rid of you.

All of this is made worse by the fact that generally the ones censoring are heavily liberal, as most people that use Reddit are. (Being liberal is okay, I'm a moderate, so I don't really care). Both sides of the political spectrum have both good and bad ideas, but only a weak person would try to censor everything that doesn't agree with their liberal agenda. I've seen conservatives do it too. Just not as much. Sometimes the censorship isn't even politically motivated, people just get butthurt.

The icing on the cake is that Reddit administrators are extremely liberal and will always 100% side with mods, especially if they're trying to create a safe space. 

Reddit puts on this mask of ""the last bastion of free speech on the internet "" when in reality they're creating the biggest censorship atrocity on the internet. I have faith in time it will die.

Censorship will kill Reddit.

Safe spaces will kill Reddit. 

Cancerous moderation will kill Reddit.

Admins who side with the more socially acceptable will kill Reddit.


Edit: By ""Moderate"" I'm saying that I'm in the middle, I base my political beliefs on what I think is right, and I don't agree wholeheartedly with either party. Both have great and terrible beliefs. I go with logic and empathy over blindly siding with one side of a spectrum. I'm pretty sure that's what moderate means, but some people seem to think moderate is something else. I'm just clearing that up.",2018-12-01 18:04:10

2nd Edit: to clear things up a bit with a bit of context since a lot of people have taken this personally. Ive seen a lot of people share their stories about their crappy experiences with cops but you guys at least tried which tells me that an actual crime happened. I'm talking about the people that don't even attempt to go to the cops and yet have no issue coming out on twitter and using their followers instead.
Recently in the Voice Acting scene a popular VA has been accused of sexual assault because he gets affectionate and hugs all his fans and sometimes pecks them on the cheek. Hes now being fired from everything and some of his fellow VAs are coming out saying that he sexually assaulted them too. They havent tried going to the police nor have they said anything other than the blanket term ""sexual assault"" which these days could be a hug. 
I've seen people say ""wow seeing this backlash i can see why its hard for women to come forward"" theres a big difference between going to the police and making a report and publicly going after someone that has a dedicated fan following. 
Apparently this has been happening for years but no one got a restraining order against him and no one is getting specific on what it is they did. They're ""brave"" enough to use a blanket term but they don't have the balls to say whether it was rape,grope etc and then they wonder why so many people don't believe them. ",2019-02-09 05:03:51

There are people that literally play sports in high school and then go to college for sports management, kinesiology, or sports marketing.

If two drunk people have sex it makes no sense for people to validate one person as being assaulted or raped,13774,atztqk,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/atztqk/if_two_drunk_people_have_sex_it_makes_no_sense/,1206,1550983124.0,"I see this more when its a girl accusing the guy of rape, but the fact that its socially accepted is horrifying to me. If two parties are both wasted and have sex how can one person be a rapist? The logic of too drunk to consent would make them both rapists? I will never understand this or accept it. I agree that there are some situations where maybe past behaviour indicates rapey tendencies but if its a one off event and the girl is accusing the guy of rape that should rightfully be taken with a grain of salt if they were both drunk. Reduced judgement capacity due to intoxication would apply to both parties and its purely the social construction of women being vulnerable or weak that assumes the woman was taken advantage of by the man. I cannot express this to people without being called anti-women (im a woman yall) or brainwashed by patriarchal western society. 

Edit: I've read some of the comments on my post and there are some things I think I should clarify. I absolutely am aware of the low conviction rate of rape cases but people seem to forget the power of social media and in general gossip which is a different kind of punishment that follows you for life. I have also personally seen someone be accused of rape after a drunken hookup and because theres an assumption that questioning anything a possible rape victim may say is considered callous and generally horrible everyone rallied around her (except me) regardless of what we all saw. Im not commenting on the efficacy and complexity of the legal system as it pertains to rape cases, but making an observation based on what I have seen and what I believe to be an ultimately illogical line of reasoning in this very specific situation.

Well, hello Brad Pitt, Ryan Reynolds, Ryan Gosling, Chris hemsworth, Jason momoa, dwayne Johnson, John cena, Channing Tatum, etc, etc...the list goes on.

The ""standard"" women face is for the most part weight. Most overweight people have the ability to exercise and diet to cut their weight, and although theres a rare few who have conditions causing their obesity, most of them are just too lazy and lack the discipline to drop the pounds. Plus there's all of those ""love your body"" campaigns trying to make overweight women feel like they're ""good enough"". At least they have makeup as a viable option.

 Sure losing weight is hard but let's look at what men are facing.

Let's start with height. Gotta be 6ft or taller. 5'11 doesnt cut it, and apparently they can tell the difference. I'm kidding, they cant, but if they ask you, and you're 5'10 or 5'11, you better lie because apparently those few inches are a deal breaker. Men face the SAME struggle with weight, *Billy May's voice* -- but wait, theres more! Do you have any idea how hard it is to get a ripped body like all those male celebs that parade around shirtless in the movies? Its REALLY fucking hard. For some people, it's not even possible. It goes beyond weight. Female celebs get boob jobs, ass jobs, etc, which any woman can get, but the men have to train for years to get the body you see in movies and magazines. To top it off, we cant wear makeup either. Not that we want to, but as a man you have to show every flaw you have, yet they call that plus sized female model who couldn't put down the fork the brave one.

So please, stop acting like women are the only one facing an unrealistic standard. Sure men could complain, but complaining about it would make them seem like less of a man, so I guess that's another thing to add to the list.",2019-04-13 21:48:30

It's still my opinion that /r/politics should be at the very least renamed to something more appropriate like /r/leftleaning or /r/leftpolitics or anything that is a more accurate description of the subreddit's content. /r/the_donald is at least explicitly clear with their bias, and I feel it's only appropriate that at a minimum /r/politics should reflect their bias in their name as well if they are going to stay in /r/popular

They have no idea what day it is, so how can they tell you yes that they want piercings? 


I've wondered this all my life. 

When I was a kid, I got my ears pierced. I had waited so long and finally after my mom was sure it was what i wanted, she let me get them done. I went to the place and saw a baby screaming as she was getting her ears pierced. Her mom was holding her and telling her to quiet down because she was screaming. I remember looking at my mom and asking why she was doing that. My mom sometimes just didn't have an answer and that was a time that she didn't. Even then I knew something was wrong with that picture. 

So now I'm older and realize that getting babies ears pierced is really fucked up. The baby can't even say yes or no to wanting their ears pierced. We all throw a fit when someone can't consent to something these days, so really why is this allowed? 

I've met people who had this happen and they didn't like the idea of piercings, but still had the holes in their ears from it. I got mine done years ago and I never wear earrings, but the holes are still there. I don't regret it, but I can't imagine how people feel that they got their ears pierced against their will when they couldn't even understand the meaning behind it. 

Anytime I bring this up it's an ""you're overreacting"" or ""it's not your child, why do you care?"" I feel like I'm going insane here, but how is this okay. How is piercing a baby who can't even understand what pierced ears are okay? ",2018-12-23 00:05:51

He looked like he could be my Lolo Albino and I just couldn't imagine myself walking up to someone elderly and choosing to target and harass them. 





I went searching for other video clips and information about the incident where they said that these kids approached the elder, interrupted a ceremony, got in his face and started chanting things like ""build the wall."" I did not find evidence of that, but I did find a whole bunch of other footage and tried to piece everything together. 


I found a statement from one of the kids that a local reporter [tweeted out](https://twitter.com/AClementsWKRC/status/1086822521012473858) w/ a bunch of video clips he mentions in the statement.

- From a [full video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3EC1_gcr34) that was originally posted by a religious(?) group that was there called the Black Hebrew Israelites (BHI), it shows them street preaching to the NA group, telling them that they're worshipping the wrong god, etc. Some NA people walked up to them offended and they got into a vocal spat at the beginning of the video. The group of kids aren't seen until [46:41](https://youtu.be/t3EC1_gcr34?t=2802), where one of the street preachers calls the kids fagg***, crackers, school shooters, etc) and they walk away ~5' later while they're being called animals. 





- The group of kids congregate off to the side seen on [1:05:00](https://youtu.be/t3EC1_gcr34?t=3927), waiting I assume for a bus to pick them up. BHI turns around and starts calling them names again and then the kids start what sounds like school chants and a mini haka at 1:09:00. I do not hear 'build a wall' in any of the videos. More kids meet up with the group; I guess that's the meeting place they were told to go to and they start doing another chant. One street preacher provides commentary on their chants. Kids take a knee at 1:12:00 and BHI jokes(?) that they're kneeling to Israel (them) and then the kids start another chant while the NA group appears around 1:12:20 heading into the group of kids. Some people in the NA group were dancing as they meet the kids who were finishing up their chant. The kids turn around and start jumping up and down to the beat of the drums. No one tells the kids what they're doing; they're just beating drums at them and doing their own chanting. And while I might consider it disrespectful, it doesn't look malicious when the kids joined in the NA chants (this is where all the shocking viral clips came from). These kids did not approach the NA group, interrupting their ceremony. The rest of the video is BHI talking to some of the kids and trying to antagonize them.





- Close up of when the NA group approached the student group as they were doing another chant: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnLJLjuiRg8






- Another [video is one where the doxxed kid is standing in front of the elder.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npX801xLSFY) The small group of kids confronting BHI starts chanting again and the rest of the group does as well. Several kids in the back are dancing and look like they're enjoying listening to the drums and chanting from the NA group. A couple of kids ask what is going on and wondering what the NA group is doing at [1'06""](https://youtu.be/npX801xLSFY?t=66) and [1'20""](https://youtu.be/npX801xLSFY?t=82). People on social media were angry at pictures that looked like the doxxed kid was smirking at the elder, thinking that he was making fun of him or intimidating him. But it honestly looks like an awkward situation where someone approached right to him, looking at him and performing something. Like, I myself would just stare and wait, listening until the elder was done like the kid was doing. 






- Off to the side, a man from the NA group is heard talking to another kid at [1:35](https://youtu.be/npX801xLSFY?t=95), saying ""white people, go back to Europe where you came from...this is not your land..."" Things get heated, and the doxxed kid who's facing the NA elder turns to the other kid at [2:09](https://youtu.be/npX801xLSFY?t=129) and motions to him to just let it go and stop arguing while the elder is finishing his chant. That, to me, doesn't seem like a kid who is acting maliciously. Things get even more heated from that one guy and it looks like some of the kids realize that these people don't like them and they walk away. The rest of the video is a kid again wondering what just happened, the NA group finishes their performance and cheers w/ that one guy still being worked up, and more BHI preaching stuff where they call [""trump a homosexual""/rants about gays/etc](https://youtu.be/npX801xLSFY?t=437) and the kids are wondering where the buses are to leave and they get excited and chant again when the buses arrive.







- After looking at what I think is everything, it's clear the social media mob is going after them for no reason.  The viral clips look downright malicious and horrible out of context, especially when people who look at it automatically think these kids are evil just based on the hats they're wearing. It's clear they were not being malicious and it also looks like the viral clips were exploited for political propaganda. It's disgusting that adults would use kids this way for their own gain, and I'm sickened that people are still harassing and doxxing these kids. Yesterday and even this morning there are people on social media who are asking their followers to literally assault these kids and ruin their lives for no reason except what they imagine. So far, 0 media organizations that wrote about the viral clips have not looked to see what actually happened. It's really disconcerting that we have reached the point at what I thought was still a civil society where hatred of someone is re-directed at kids.

Granted, I can't exactly call it self-defense. Chances are, a woman hitting a man isn't exactly a threat to his life. But it doesn't have to be. She is trying to cause him pain. He should have the right to cause her pain in return. I'm not saying he should go ape-shit on her and send her into a coma, but at the same time he should have the right hit her with the intention of causing her pain.

Far too often I see women hitting men *knowing* they won't hit back. This expectation that men won't hit back encourages women like this to be aggressive. Men don't pick fights with bigger men because they have a rational fear of the bigger guy hitting back. Too often, women use this expectation of chivalry as armor.",2018-11-15 07:42:33

I'm also writing this at 4:46 AM so bear with me, I just wanted to put it down into words before I forgot.

I live in New York. I've seen my fair share of hoods.  And I browse social media and listen to tons of music, just to see people defending gang activity and such.

I really don't get it. People know killing and stealing is wrong, yet they glorify these people for their ""struggles"" when they definitely get involved with violent activity. Being poor does not give you the right to kill and steal! But people will blindly listen to hiphop and rap because it's ""woke"" and they sympathize with these asshole rappers. It's become cool to break the law because ""fuck the police"", and all police use excessive force, apparently.

People on social media seem to just be so proud of their gang relations, and the crimes they commit, and post about it to their blind audience who likes and retweets everything about it. People listen to hiphop where rappers sing about the atrocities they have and still commit, and people will be like ""yo i fuck with this"" and ""yo this is so woke"".   I fucking hate it.

Gangs have become a race thing. If you're against gangs, you're racist, it seems. People have tied gangs to specific races such as latinos and black people. And I think that's why it's normified, both indirectly and directly. I've literally seen movements such as ""protect our hoods"" try and directly stop deslumification. It's so stupid- there is nothing good about breaking the law or being in poverty. But people really think that this is how life is for black and latino people, which really contributes to the racism we have today.

I seriously wish we didn't come to this. A society of violent assholes seems to be on the rise to social acceptance, and it's a huge tumor to everyone. There is absolutely nothing to be proud of here. Defending rape, mugging, killing, drug dealing, etc. makes you just as bad as the person committing them.

I think it‚Äôs very cool that people want others to feel accepted and comfortable despite being different than a perceived majority. 

However, all bodies are not beautiful, and we shouldn‚Äôt pretend they are. People that are overweight to the degree it affects their health are not beautiful, they‚Äôre unhealthy. They don‚Äôt deserve to be mistreated for it, but they also shouldn‚Äôt be constantly validated. 

There is a biological standard for objective physical attraction partially rooted in physical health. We are not attracted to people that won‚Äôt be healthy mates. We are not attracted to people that look unhealthy. We should stop pretending unhealthy bodies are attractive because they aren‚Äôt. I hate seeing people validate someone‚Äôs unhealthy lifestyle because they don‚Äôt want them to feel bad. It‚Äôs not a good way to help people, it just makes things worse.

Edit 1: Reading the comments I saw a few people telling me that I was talking about a skinny body and that I should clarify that. That‚Äôs not quite true. Skinny can also be unhealthy and therefore unattractive, but it is true that I am mostly addressing weight when I talk about a healthy body. 

Edit 2: I don‚Äôt think that amputations or scars make a person not beautiful. If your body is healthy, it‚Äôs beautiful. It‚Äôs a very cut-and-dry opinion. If you have scars, had an amputation for medical reasons, or anything like that your body can certainly still be beautiful. I only want my post to address things that are in the control of the person.

Edit 3: Hopefully my final edit. I‚Äôm sorry if I have been unclear. I have a lot of comments about how beauty is subjective, so let me clarify: this post refers to an objective standard of physical attraction that is held by having a healthy body and lost by having an unhealthy body.

I've heard multiple women say that all men are like that, not just certain individuals. I've never heard any man say they hate all women, but I've heard women say they hate all men. 

Lesser examples include the results from unhappy breakups. When men rant, it's about someone specific: ex-girlfriend or wife. If a woman's angry, it's a rant about the entire male gender. This is a generality of course and I can only speak from my own experience. 

Then there's the constant messages to men about how to treat women. Teach your son to respect women, teach men to respect women; treat your girlfriend like a princess, etc. Constant posts about how men don't have empathy for women.

It is never okay to become violently angry with them because they won't kiss you or because they don't share the same feelings you have.

Since then school shootings have gone onto kill around 20 more bringing the total to 260. The total suicides between ages 15-24 in 2014 was 5,079, meaning for every death by school shooting since 2000 about 19.5 suicides occurred. Now let's add in the 2017 numbers (6,265) to the 2014 numbers and we get 11,331 which brings the ration between suicides and school shooting deaths from 19.5-1 to 43.5-1. Now I couldn't find the total number of suicides in that age range since 2000 but let's take 11,331 and decide in half, we get 5,665.5 which when multiply that by 18 (counting from '00-18) we have an estimated 101,979 teen/young adult suicides between 2000 and 2018 bringing the ratio of suicides to school shooting deaths to about 392-1.

You catch one and someone‚Äôs little kid is nearby and they‚Äôre either crying or giving you that Oliver Twist ‚ÄúMay I have some more?‚Äù look.

If you want to give the kid the ball, great. If you don‚Äôt and you keep it, also great. I mean, think of who has more invested, here. The adult likely bought their own ticket, has been a loyal fan of MLB for much longer, understands and appreciates the game at a higher level than the child, will probably take better care of the ball.

But of course the cameras will be on you and everyone will be ready to hate you if you don‚Äôt give the kid the ball. As a person who wants kids, fuck dem kids. It‚Äôll be a good lesson in how unfair life is. So let‚Äôs weigh pros and cons.

If you give the ball away, people will say you‚Äôre a swell person online, but you‚Äôll be upset because you don‚Äôt have the ball. 

If you keep the ball, people will shit on you online and likely in the stadium, but then they‚Äôll forget AND you still have the ball. Kid will forget by next week. 

The winning option is clear. I‚Äôm not even a huge baseball fan but if I should so happen to be at a Cardinal‚Äôs game one day and I catch a ball, I am keeping it and ignoring every kid near me unless it‚Äôs my own kid.

**EDIT2: since people keep asking why an adult would want to keep the ball, a Blues player gave me a hockey puck a little while back. It sits on my mantle and is a great conversation piece. The baseball would do the same thing. But also, if I wanted to give the ball to my dog as a toy, that‚Äôs my prerogative. The happiness of my husky means more to me than the happiness of some random kid. I also have friends who are huge baseball fans with kids who play. One kid I know personally and play chess with is 14 and a very good player and dreams to make it to the MLB. I can also see myself giving it to him.

If they're that hateful that they drive someone to take thier own life then they should bare witness to the consequences of their actions, I don't feel like it's enough to just tell them, show them. Obviously with the permission of the family. 


I also feel like they should answer to the family of the person they bullied, really get a feel for what they have done. It will probably scar them for life, GOOD, the pain the family will be in for the rest of their lives is incomparable so the guilty party should feel at least a percentage of that. 


It may seem harsh but I just read a story about a young boy who layed in front of a train and killed himself due to being bullied. He was 14. He killed himself in front of 40/50 other students including his friends who will also be scarred for life. All because some vicious little pricks harrassed him until he no longer saw a light at the end of the tunnel. And what will the guilty get? Slap on the wrist? Expulsion? Ridiculous. Teach them a lesson, make them look at what they've done and give them the opportunity to apologise face to face to the families who have been broken by the sadistic actions of these nasty, spiteful kids. I'm talking high school and up because that's generally where it gets bad, although this is starting to creep into primary schools too which is horrifying.


If I thought for one second that any kind of preventative measure would work then I'd suggest that instead. But years of unrelenting abuse and families losing their kids to suicide has lead me to believe that there is no tactic of prevention that would actually work worldwide. That hurts my heart. People are so cruel. I don't want to send my baby to school, I'm terrified. And my heart is broken for that poor boy, his friends and family, and all of the innocent kids who saw such a horrific scene unfold 4 days before their summer holidays began.

The standard where we are now required to keep everyone alive and with basic necessities goes against the fundamental principle of how life has always worked. Why are we letting low IQ people who are addicted to drugs and on food stamps reproduce? A couple of hundred years ago, and these people are systematically taken care of by nature. Now the burden is on everyone else to take care of a growing class of idiots who will never contribute to society. Not only are they not producing, but hinder the progress of the brightest because their hard work is being sapped by the bottom 50%. No other species does this, humans are a special and remarkable species but to ignore the rules of nature has proven to be foolish. Other animals love their offspring as well, but they also understand that if their kid is too weak to independently survive, keeping him/her alive will cause their entire species to eventually go extinct. The short term value of not naturally selecting a better human population is just asking for the entire population to collapse, which will probably happen in the next couple hundred of years at this point considering how greedy humans are.

Obviously if your struggling you don‚Äôt what your family to come home to see your lifeless corpse hanging from the ceiling or your brains just simply splattered like paint all over the bedroom walls and ceiling. Using someone else to kill you like a Truck or train imho is just selfish and not morally right, imagine leaving a burden on them because they technically are the cause of your death and are charged with involuntary manslaughter.

Another reason people should be entitled to Euthanasia because the Mental Healthcare system in the US is a joke. Take it from me, a person that‚Äôs been having expensive therapy sessions for over 4 years with many different therapists and I admit I have tried Suicide once which is what gotten me Therapy in the first place.

Two feet on stairs is slower. Do I partake in the superior way to go up stairs? No. Is going up stairs on all fours still better? Yes. It's quicker, easier and more efficient in every way possible.

The reason most don't go up the stairs like this is because it has become hated on. Like when Jesus spoke to the Roman's. Us few preach the truth while people hate because they are blinded by ignorance. Dont be asleep. Become W O K E and go up the stairs/escalators on all fours

It was a shame when he retired but it was time for that awesome torch to be passed. Trevor Noah was announced and I didn't know much about him but thought it would be cool to get a change of scenery and a fresh perspective.

I remember he got in trouble because of some offensive tweets about jewish people. Not only were the tweets completely unwarranted, they weren't even funny. He was trying to make a jew joke and it straight up and down wasn't even funny. So I watched his Netflix special at the time. Not only was it not funny, it was one of the more worse standup specials on Netflix, and I've seen almost all of them.

So I watched him on the Daily Show for months, thinking he'll eventually get into a groove and a good zone to start unleashing that high-octane wit that was associated with the program. I GENUINELY, SINCERELY, from the bottom of my heart tried to get into him, for so long, and that same lame-ass, tired, run-into-the-ground racial observations, penis jokes and impersonations of different accents that was the bread and butter for his standup didn't change. At least the Daily show was good at calling out media bullshit, but now under Trevor it has just become a mouthpiece for the media bullshit that Jon worked so passionately to combat.

**TL;DR**: I know that humor is subjective, but from my earnest and sincere perspective, gained by watching hours of the show, and all of his Netflix specials, my opinion has only solidified that not only is he not a funny/good comedian, but he is one of the worst out there, along with Jeff Dunham, Gabriel Iglesias, and... fuck it, Ricky Gervais.",2019-02-08 07:03:44

Apparently the students would hate the one student for holding them up and not teacher.

I always hated that because I could hear the grumbles and mumbles of an angry students. And the anger is towards me and not the one student. 

I feel like it is better to escort my class to the lunchroom. And escort the one student back to my class. That one student will see and hear all of their classmates having a fun time in the lunch room. Laughing, talking, goofing around, and trading food.

And be bummed sitting in the classroom alone and board with me. All I do is text my husband, go on reddit, and grade papers. That one student has to eat and think about their actions.

And after lunch my students get to run around and play on the playground. Depending how disruptive the student was, I keep them in for 5 or 10 minutes.

During this time I make the one student clean desks, staple papers together, or other minor stuff. 

After they are done, I ask them if they understood why I kept them in. Add a heart to heart chat. Tell them I appreciate the work they did in my room today. And let them go.

But today my coworkers told me I am doing it wrong. I need to keep my whole class in. The students will hate that one student and the one student will feel guilty enough to stop. Friends giving the friend the stink eye ensures that they won't act up again.

However 4/5 times the one student acting up is just part of a bigger problem. There could be stress at home that is causing them to act out. Having them alone in my room, time to calm down, think things out, and a heart to heart talk shows them that this is a safe place to talk with a trusted adult. 

It could be something small like stressing out over the next test. Or something big. I have had the toughest of bullies crying in my room because their parents are divorcing and they think it is all their fault.

I tried telling this to my coworker but they say if the student is really having trouble at home, they will to come to us for help.

I can't get half my students to admit when they need a pencil. I have one kid so shy he only speaks to me, the librarian, and his parents in whisper. Took me five months for me to get him to nod yes and no to me in front of the other students.

I don't know where my co-workers are getting the outgoing students.

Honestly, my shy student will be the only one happy staying in my room for lunch if one student acts up. But the rest will have the look of murder in their eyes. 

More so if it is Friday and pizza is being severed in the lunchroom. Hell if I hold my students up for a second on pizza day there will be a riot in my room. 

I been doing this since I first started teaching a couple years ago. Then again, I am a young teacher. And my coworkers are a bit older. Does experience have to do with it? Will I change my mind when I am older? 

For now, my method works. My class average is above the rest of my coworkers. My students are happy in class. I have a couple of students I see during recess and after school that just need to talk some stuff out.

This also applies to the two dozen comments about going to church. My definition of brainwashed doesn‚Äôt include that, and I‚Äôve responded to it enough that I‚Äôd prefer for you to scroll through the thread. Won‚Äôt be starting new comment lines about that.

If I were given legal permission to eat human flesh I would happily try it,10954,bdt6qx,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/bdt6qx/if_i_were_given_legal_permission_to_eat_human/,1174,1555445495.0,"The idea of eating of human flesh has always made me curious, now I'm not saying that I wanna eat humans, I'd just only eat if I were I given permission or if the corpse died recently like in a car crash.

 I told this to every one in my religion/philosophy class where we were discussing moral desicion making. If you know that senario where you're in WW2 and your hiding from the nazis with a group of people but then suddenly the baby starts crying. Would you kill the baby and save everyone in the room or dont do anything and get everyone killed including yourself

Most people said kill the baby and I followed up with it saying ""Yeah, and if were hungry we can eat the baby, since at that time of war, you wouldn't wanna starve""

Everyone in that class were freaking out by what I said and the teacher was speechless. And now they bring it up everytime in class. I don't mind it really but surely people must agree with me on this.

Edit: This is my most upvoted post on reddit. And its about cannibalism. I just wanna make something clear because some guy just tried to report me to the  DOJ.

 I dont want to murder people. I just wanna try out a sample of human flesh, only for the legal reasons. I am crazy, but I'm not insane to go on some quest for the flesh. I have more important things to do in life. And if this bites me back in the ass. Its just gonna be wasting everyones time because I have no interest in pursuing this. Its more of the curiousity of it, not the actions. Thank you and goodbye

Edit 2: Also to mention people are saying ""prion diseases"" and you're right. I don't want to get prion disease, so theres no way I'll be eating human anytime soon. üòÇ

Edit 3: People are also saying ""why not just eat my own self""? Well because thats auto-cannibalism. I rather have my limbs and flesh to my self. If someone was mad enough to amputate him/herself and offer me flesh. Thens theres nothing stopping me from eating it, is there?

Edit 4: So suprisingly this is blowing up, faster than I expected to be. I got a message from CRD (cyber security). So I'm being traced now which is jussssst great. Like I don't mind really, as long as they  don't come knocking on my door. This is was only an opinion I expressed on /r/UnpopularOpinions and it was all fun and goofs. Like I said I would never act upon all of this. I just want to make things clear AGAIN, that I rather do something thats for my well being. This situation is getting too serious, I never did or said anything that was illegal. I know what I wrote was gross and inhumane but doesn't mean you have to get me behind bars for it.

Edit 5: Alright, if you're wondering what is with this ""CRD buisness"". I got message from what I think is a bot. And said something along the lines of 
<mark ::8086 - tracert>
CRD~ Cyber. 
Now I dont know what the hell this all means but I googled it and got Cyber Security. Maybe I'm being trolled but /u/heycrybaby(the messenger) has no karma so possibly could be a bot or someone tryna scare I don't know.

It's a worldwide issue. People kill themselves for many different reasons and it's tragic.

My heart goes out to the people suffering so badly they want it all to end. My heart goes out to their families and friends. 

But if you jump in front of a train (or any vehicle driven by others) to end it all you're a piece of shit. 

You want to kill yourself that's your business. I wish you didn't feel you had to and I wish you felt you could get help. But don't completely fuck up others lives! How dare you destroy the life of the innocent drivers and lives of their passengers for your selfish desire to end your own!

End of the day you don't care. You're dead. The living have to try and put their lives together and go on. You don't.

But fuck you. Asshole.

Edited to fix spelling.

Edit to add:

I didn't expect this to blow up like it did.

To those people saying I don't know what it's like to be suicidal or I'm underestimating the pain,
I don't underestimate. I've been there.

I'm not saying people who kill themselves in this manner are  annoying ME persay, I'm saying their actions by killing themselves in that manner can potentially fuck up the lives of strangers. Innocent people like the bus driver just doing his job. The kid going to school. The person struggling with their own mental demons. 

How is that not selfish?

How is that not wrong?

It's terrible when people feel they need to end it all. Some, like me, get help or pull themselves through it. Some don't and that's tragic. 

But yes I get upset when innocents suffer because of the actions of one. I've seen it too many times not to get upset. 

So I make no apologies for my opinion other than to say perhaps the aggression and swearing could have been worded better and still got the point across. 

If you choose to think I'm an asshole well that's ok. Thank you all for your comments good and bad. It's certainly made me think reading them and has opened my eyes.

Putin is a corrupt dictator, a dick with few if any redeeming characteristics, and he does not give two fucks about any developing country.

That does not change the fact that he is fundamentally right on this.

For most of the developing world,  the cost of entry/adoption of renewable energy is prohibitively expensive.

If you are a developing country like Nigeria, for example, you desperately need to build and run massive water cleaning plants for you capital, Lagos, with a population of 22 million people, most of which lack sewerage and clean water.  You also need to build infrastructure like bridges, a train/subway system, tunnels, roads, airports, etc...All of that takes lots of electricity, concrete, steel, and lots and lots of CO2 emissions. Nigeria is very very rich in Oil by the way, which they can extract quite cheaply.

So it would be a very interesting conversation to watch when some privileged kid from a rich country who always benefited from an amazing infrastructure build on the back of fossil fuels, tells Nigeria that they should not build that inexpensive coal/oil power plant in order to run that water purification plant that they desperately need, because they will be worse off in the end due to global warming. That they should wait many more years and save a lot more money to build a solar power plant instead (never mind the issues of energy storage or running the water plants at night).

Yes, many of their children might die of dysentery in the mean time, but on the long run, it will be better for the planet. It would be a truly fascinating conversation to watch.

&#x200B;

EDIT: To the folks who will inevitably come claiming that ""solar is cheaper"", please explain [this shit](https://outline.com/69TmGX) before you post it.

"Reddit is too hard to actively participate in due to ridiculous sub rules, post formating, tyrannical mods, and rude users. No wonder a majority of the user base doesn't participate.",10898,ci8pz0,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/ci8pz0/reddit_is_too_hard_to_actively_participate_in_due/,1540,1564205016.0,"I don't quite know where to start, but so many subs make it frustrating to actively participate in them. If you want to post content, you have to first check sub rules, then make sure the post title is formatted, and then hope that the mods don't use the extremely vague rules to remove your post. Even if your posts stays up, you have to then make sure people aren't rude assholes about what opinions or content you dare share.

It's like a pack of ravenous wolves waiting to rip whatever words you have to shreds.
Do you have a cool idea for something, and want to share? Well that's too bad, because a dozen users are waiting to tell you how you're wrong, and your ideas are terrible.

So you have to find good content, and meticulously make sure it fits sub rules, nazi mod's personal tastes, and make sure it can't get picked apart by smartass Redditors looking to ""well actually"" you with some swift ""facts"" they pulled from a 10 year old unreputable article. 

It's exhausting. On top of which, Reddit sometimes blocks posting for a number of minutes in certain subs, so if you fuck up a title by accident, you have to wait 5-10 minutes to actually fix your mistakes, and by then, I'm usually just frustrated beyond interest anymore. 

It's just not a fun environment to participate in. No wonder people respond with generic jokes and low efforts comments, because that's the easiest way to just slide into participating without worrying about much. 

Posting opinions is exhausting, no matter how innocent you think they are, or even if you are just having fun with hypotheticals. An opinion post always has to be self aware enough to deconstruct every smartass counter argument before you even hit the submit button, and it's exhausting. 

Want to ask/ express why the new Corvette should be offered in purple? Well you'll have 20 people tell you it's stupid, it's not financially feasible, and it'll never sell. 

Defending yourself on anything just gets you in trouble, and mods with NEVER take your side with anything. A mod will never side with you over another mod. You can't barter with these people. You can't logically defend anything against their decisions. 

No matter how innocent the sub seems, the mods always seem to be on a power trip. 

It's honestly just not ""fun"". The ""Reddit is Fun"" app should be named ""Reddit isn't Fun"". 

I honestly don't understand what it is about human nature, where eveyone has to be a negative dickhead. I don't get why everything has to be overly structured to the point of sucking the very enjoyment from the activity. 

And those are both rhetorical questions. Something most Redditors can't grasp for some reason. 

You can stalk my history. I get frustrated with things, but I try not to pick fights for the sake of doing it. I don't troll. Arguing is just a waste of energy on here. I just like to express my interest in certain things, and hope other like minded people chime in. The issue is no like minded people ever chime in for much. It's always people telling you how wrong you are, but never someone backing you up. It's just exhausting. 

For the love of god active Reddit users, reply to people's opinions you stand by with something positive, and stop being so damn negative all the time. Life can be negative enough. Don't let it spill into everything you do. 

Fight for less strict rules if you get frustrated, and go through the proper reporting channels to put tyrannical mods in their place. This place just gets worse the more nobody does anything about it.

TL:DR Fucking read it.

No. Some kids are just fucking stupid. 

I‚Äôve tutored a high schooler who legitimately did not know what 2+2 was, and they weren‚Äôt special Ed or trying to be funny or anything like that. Some people are just stupid and it‚Äôs their own fault they fail, not the fault of anyone around them. No amount of extra hard work from their teachers or tutors will make them smarter.

They should be given up on. These people don‚Äôt even want to succeed in academics.

It‚Äôs a waste of everyone‚Äôs time to force teachers to teach at the pace of the slowest kid, take time away from those who can learn to dedicate more time to the idiot, and to hire a tutor to try to magically make the idiot smarter. 

Valuable time and resources dedicated to helping these failures shouldn‚Äôt be given to them. That extra time should be spent working with the kids who actually can learn and want to learn. Plenty of parents have thrown hundreds of dollars at me a month to make their kid smarter and get better grades, only for their kid to be completely hopeless.

"It isn't ""amazing"" that a person with disabilities half-asses something able-bodied people do.",10557,cdd68n,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/cdd68n/it_isnt_amazing_that_a_person_with_disabilities/,1674,1563195588.0,"I figure this one will make me sound like a real jerk, but hear me out.

It seems like every day I see some video on Facebook with sappy music where some person with a disability performs a feat that a person with that disability doesn't typically perform. It leads to a bunch of congratulation and applause by everyone. But it never makes sense to me. 

I think creating tasks and events for someone with limitations is perfectly viable. Special Olympics? Hell yeah. The story of a blind kid being allowed to play football on a team of able-bodied kids? Come on. 

I recently saw a video of a girl with cerebral palsy who took up boxing. Cue amazement from everyone. But she's having people cater specifically to her disability, and the message is supposed to be that she overcame the odds... 

Except that all she actually does it flail around on her knees with gloves on while someone kneels down so she can hit the hand pads... Kinda. She hasn't overcome anything because she's not actually achieving a task beyond awkwardly slapping her hands about. It isn't REALLY boxing, so calling it that is kind of silly. She's still not ""normal"", and no one is fooled into believing she is. It's a spectacle, and I'm not impressed - I'm cringing. 

I once saw a video of a guy with a severe physical limitation completing an obstacle course of sorts. Except he didn't. He was pulled and carried through most of it while someone filmed the pitiful experience. There was nothing inspirational about it because nothing was ACTUALLY overcome. He just created a spectacle and inconvenienced a bunch of people who ultimately felt sorry for him. The course wasn't made for his limitations, and he accomplished nothing. 

Hell, I have severe back and nerve issues, so I can't lift much weight. Therefore, I don't work in a field that requires it, and I sometimes have my wife carry heavier items. Them's the breaks. 

And please understand, I'm not implying that I believe that people with disabilities are less of a human or that they deserve any less respect or love. But every being on the planet has built-in limitations. There's nothing wrong with living within them, and sorta-kinda doing something you can't REALLY do isn't impressive or inspirational. It's awkward. 

TLDR:

A disabled person isn't ""overcoming a disability"" by creating a spectacle and pretending they can do what able-bodied people can do, and the ""amazement"" people feel when seeing someone half-ass accomplish something like this is just a more optimistic form of pity. They're well aware that the disabled person isn't truly accomplishing the task in any realistic manner, and so is the disabled person. 

Don't pretend to be something you're not. If you can't truly accomplish a task the real way, it's not made for your limitations, and that's okay. You're still awesome.",2019-07-15 20:59:48

"Public School Teachers are OVERpaid, not underpaid.",10306,ayw7ba,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/ayw7ba/public_school_teachers_are_overpaid_not_underpaid/,2181,1552112667.0,"Very unpopular opinion that I have literally received death threats for. 

Public school teachers in the United States earn a median income around $56,000 per year.  This is far too HIGH.  

https://www.bls.gov/ooh/education-training-and-library/mobile/high-school-teachers.htm

https://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/high-school-teacher/salary

https://www1.salary.com/Public-School-Teacher-Salary.html

I‚Äôm not saying what they do is not noble, important, or difficult.  I am saying they are paid too much compared to other professions.

1.  Public school teachers are paid through tax dollars under contracts negotiated by unions with the power to strike. This artificially inflates their wages and benefits.  (The purpose of a union). It‚Äôs revealed in the numbers.  Private school teachers, who do not have the power to force a tax payer to pay more, earn far less.  Some estimates are as low as $37,000.  

https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Private_School_Teacher/Salary

Teachers Union Convention, NEA top official - It‚Äôs not for the kids, it‚Äôs for the power.

https://youtu.be/baM8N24K8kE

2.  The median HOUSEHOLD income in the United States is only about $62,000.  That means that ONE teacher‚Äôs income is nearly equal to the median income of entire households, most of which contain two or more incomes.  

But wait Billy Mays, There‚Äôs more. 

3.  Teachers are required by contract to perform their job only about 180 days per year.  Private sector non-education wage jobs have 260 work days per year.  Business owners work up to 365 days
- all net of holidays obviously for simplicity since Christmas and New Years etc. happen for everyone - 

Annualized pay to equal out the effort put in by private sector and self employed workers then reflects an equivalent of $89,500 and $125,700. 

And please, don‚Äôt tell me ‚ÄúTeachers work 16 hours per day 364 for little Johnnie doing lesson plans and grading papers.‚Äù  Stop it.  Third Grade long division has not changed for 2 centuries.  1 lesson plan per career can literally handle a lot of subjects - and I know teachers who do just that. 

Teaching is not easy, but it‚Äôs not hard either.  And yes, before you say ‚Äútry it once and stand in my shoes‚Äù - I have.  

4.  On average, teachers are not very good at what they do and take little to no responsibility for results.  They are more facilitators than professionals. 

‚ÄúThese kids get out of high school and can‚Äôt even read.‚Äù  

Proficiency in reading, math, science and other subjects varies depending upon what is tested and at what point in the education process it‚Äôs measured, and varies greatly from state to state and city to city, but reading proficiency is often as low at 40%.  Math often under 50%.  Half or more of our public school students are being pushed out into the world whether they are prepared or not.  Private schools do considerably better in every category across the board. 

It‚Äôs because federal funding - for those sweet salaries and benefits - is tied primarily to graduation rates, not proficiency.  And when proficiency tests are proposed, teachers scream like a banshee that it‚Äôs unfair to test teachers based upon whether their students have learned.  

You can peruse this trove of data if you like.  It‚Äôs fascinating actually.  https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/index.asp?faq=FFOption3#faqFFOption3

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the parents, not us.‚Äù  

You‚Äôll often hear this in response.  And it‚Äôs true, parents are extremely important in little Johnnie‚Äôs life and success.  But that does not mean a teacher is without responsibility.  They are typically trained for at least 4 and up to 8 years post-secondary to figure out how to get little Billy the bully ready even when he‚Äôs a dick and won‚Äôt pay attention.  The gifted and smart kids are going to learn the material no matter what the teacher does or doesn‚Äôt do, all she needs to do is competently facilitate for them.  Her job is to get slow witted Corky some knowledge because he can‚Äôt learn on his own. 

5.  Schools are becoming prison camps.  For what we pay for, public schools are providing less and less benefit and more and more hazards.  I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs because there were no Donnie the drug dealer and Billy the bully when we Generation Xers were growing up.  It‚Äôs because school administrations have slowly changed the culture of schools to a more institutionalized authoritarian culture.  There is a growing attitude of contempt for students and parents.  Cops are everywhere.  Students have few if any rights.  The kids are treated with disrespect and ‚Äòzero-tolerance‚Äô policies that effect their lives and their personalities forever.  It gets worse each year. 

I do not see the same thing happening in private schools.  I believe it‚Äôs because private schools have customers, and public schools have captives - and the cliche that ‚Äúteachers are overworked and underpaid‚Äù has given them a generally bad overall attitude of smug superiority and entitlement.  They have become adversarial.  

https://youtu.be/sO_gKQUuISc

Like I said, I‚Äôve had my life threatened for this opinion locally.  It‚Äôs dogmatically accepted that teachers are heroes that are overworked and underpaid. 

Yet they work fewer days, earn more than almost half of entire households, have unions negotiating the best benefits in the country, the kids are not learning, the experience of being a student is increasingly miserable, and their own top representatives admit its not about the kids, it‚Äôs about the power.

The reason it's looked down upon for a woman to sleep with multiple men rather than vice versa is because it actually takes skill for a man to get with a woman.,10266,bju81j,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/bju81j/the_reason_its_looked_down_upon_for_a_woman_to/,2080,1556827969.0,"Now I want to start this by saying I don't give a shit who fucks who how many times, but it's obvious why men are slapped up and high-fived when they bring home a one night stand vs a woman being called a whore when she has multiple partners.

Women are picky af. Men aren't. It's in our genetics.

For a man to bring home a woman, even a promiscuous one, you need some game. You gotta have -

1. Good physical presentation, usually how you're dressed + how you actually look
2. You usually have to spend some amount of money.
3. You need to be able to produce good conversation that separates you from other men.
4. You usually need to be a couple levels above that woman (woman is a 6, guy is an 8)
5. A woman will probably ask for your occupation or field of study. A man will not care if you're a vomit collector (yes this is a job).

If a woman truly wants, she can just walk into a bar on Friday night, spend about 5 minutes scoping out the room, go up to a dude she likes, speak to him for another 10 minutes, and take him home while both are completely sober.

A man doing this? No way. It's like an epic quest that you invest most of your night into. And if you did a *very good* job, with the help of some alcohol (not wasted but slight buzz), you *may* get lucky.

There have been dating app experiments where they take a 10/10 man vs a 10/10 woman, and at the end the man who is a complete Adonis has 200/1000 matches, and the woman has 800+.

I‚Äôm sure everyone has their own experiences, but here‚Äôs a little background on me.... I was born in the US, but my parents are immigrants from the Middle East.  I was born into the opposite of wealth, debt.  We didn‚Äôt have much growing up.  Both my parents busted their ass, making a life for myself and my siblings.  I grew up in Chicago.  We didn‚Äôt come from any money, and my parents were not educated.  They learned how to speak English, and just went from there.  My dad worked as an appliance repair man, and my mom worked in retail.  We had little to nothing, but they did their best insulating us from the always impending financial ruin we were on the brink of.  My siblings and I picked up on that, but we didn‚Äôt want to add stress to them and played dumb.  They kept working hard, saving, and tried to instill in us the value of hard work and integrity, and that some day good will come of it.  At the end of the day, we (the kids) all turned out great.  We all own homes in good neighborhoods, have money saved up, and have decent work.... Most importantly we lead our lives with honesty and integrity.

So I feel like my family started from the bottom, and through sheer dedication we all made it.  While this was tough, it was not as tough as life is where they came from.  Especially today as we are Iraqi Christians (but that‚Äôs a whole other story).

I‚Äôm 32.  I‚Äôve got a great job (even though I never finished college, couldn‚Äôt afford to keep going, and my ethnic background didn‚Äôt get me anything in terms of scholarships or financial aid like some of my friends), I finally own a home, have no debt other than my mortgage, I‚Äôve got a bit saved up for a rainy day, and a pretty decent amount in my 401k for someone my age.  All of my accomplishments, and my family‚Äôs have been through discipline and sacrifice.  I didn‚Äôt buy the nice car, I bought the used Honda.  I didn‚Äôt buy the fancy clothes, I went to discount stores.  I didn‚Äôt eat out, I cooked every night.  I lived well within my means.

To my point.  I really feel like a lot of what people are angry about, fighting over, or are offended by, is complete bullshit.  Why have people gotten so soft?  Every time I turn on the news, talk to friends or people at the office, there‚Äôs a new artificial outrage that‚Äôs sweeping across the country.  Are there people still struggling with poverty, addiction, abuse, etc? Absolutely.  But I think those yelling and complaining the most are coming from some kind of privilege, or they can change their path but refuse to so they can remain a victim.

Is it just me or are things actually kind of ok and not that bad?  I just think the whining and yelling (especially from my generation) is unwarranted.  If that energy was applied to bettering themselves, they may discover there is upward mobility here in the US.  Is it evenly distributed? No, but life isn‚Äôt fair.",2019-06-22 17:46:41

Indians basically didn't exist in the US.  

Typically when making roles based on uninfluential minorities, it's considered okay to make them very negative.  This is why Asian characters were shitty roles, while Black characters weren't; Blacks made up 12% of the population, while Asians were not even 1%.  White characters were never made fun of for their whiteness, because whites were 80%+ of the populace.  

Taking this into context, it's actually commendable how great of a character Apu was written to be.  

Now the bad part:  His accent was *absolute white trash levels of horrible*, and makes me cringe listening to it.  I definitely agree that he should have been voiced by someone who could actually do a fucking Indian accent.  But again, given the time this was created in, even this isn't that big of an issue.  

I don't care who the voice actor is, because voice actors routinely voice all sorts of different races.  I've seen lots of Black voice actors voicing whites, it's not a big deal.  I'd only care that they could actually get the accent to be sort of accurate.  That would *probably* necessitate the actor being Indian though.  

For comparison, let's look at Raj, from the Big Bang Theory, which aired in 2007.  BBT pushes all sorts of stereotypes that don't even fucking make sense to me, like effeminacy and obliviousness, and these are *bad* stereotypes to boot.  And that's something that was created just 10 years ago.  Not to mention that BBT is a completely shit show aside from all of that.  

My final take:  People crying about Apu are crybabies who don't know how to think for themselves, and I don't think it's a coincidence that most of the Indian people I know aren't even fazed by him.  I will agree that his accent was trash and grossly inaccurate, and his voice actor should have been replaced a long time ago.  Apart from that, the character himself was totally fine.

If your point is solid, it can stand up without mentioning ur age. No one asked for your age. There are a few times when one would talk about age on the internet, but kids simply do talk about age at appropriate areas/threads/whatever. Like ive seen 12 year olds on r/relationshipadvice.

Men should not have to go last just because they are a man and history says women come first with that stuff.

I want to smoke so bad but I know for me personally it makes me lazier and a less productive employee. At this point I really do feel like I‚Äôm recovering from an addiction.

Weed was also my ‚Äògateway drug‚Äô as ridiculous as that claim seems to be for many people. I would never have considered other drugs until I felt how good it was to be high.

But the legalization movement characterizes weed as this wonderful thing that was wrongly made illegal. They seldom talk about these negative consequences to life and make it seem like nothing is bad about it.

That being said, I think it should be legal, we just need to respect it as the drug that it is and be clear that it is not for everyone and can cause harm to peoples lives. For some it is truly a live saving medicinal drug, so it should definitely be available to these people. But focusing the legalization effort on how much it does for people with difficult medical conditions paints weed in a much better light than it should be for the general population. 

Sorry for the rant I just had to get this out there.

TL;DR: Weed can be harmful for many people‚Äôs lives so it should not be portrayed as this wonderful thing for society as legalization takes off.

For example, she once asked if I would want a kid with Down syndrome. I said no. I wouldn‚Äôt love that child any less, of course, if there was no preventing it, **but** if I had to choose between having a child with Down syndrome and no child, I‚Äôd choose no child. Children are already a massive burden; financially, emotionally, and every-other-ally. Add a developmental disability on top? Not if I can help it. 

For context, my older brother (nearly 30) has an intellectual disability. Our parents have always been awesome with him, but eventually they won‚Äôt be around and he can‚Äôt live on his own.

It‚Äôs not a big deal if someone mispronounces your name and it shouldn‚Äôt be an excuse to get upset or rude.,6873,as5jnv,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/as5jnv/its_not_a_big_deal_if_someone_mispronounces_your/,558,1550573624.0,"Someone mispronouncing your name does not give you an excuse to be rude or dismissive. If anything, I feel like the majority of people that get upset over the mispronunciation because they have a sense of entitlement.

Obviously consistently mispronouncing someone‚Äôs name is rude, but I am speaking more about situations where there is no prior interaction between the parties.

For example, I am referring mostly to people getting mad when a new teacher or substitute mispronounces their name when calling attendance or people getting mad when they are at the doctors office waiting room and the nurse calls them in by name.

It‚Äôs NOT that big of a deal and should not be an excuse to act cold to someone. If anything, it shows little tolerance to other people‚Äôs mistakes or innocent ignorances. 

My name is in another language so as you can imagine people often mispronounce it... but you know what? It‚Äôs not that big of a deal. So freaking what!? The world moves on and nobody cares that you‚Äôre upset about someone didn‚Äôt know how to pronounce your own set of letters that can be said several different ways just by looking at it.

It‚Äôs truly sad to see people take something so little so seriously.

We should have an adult version of the book fairs from when we were kids,6822,d651q6,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/d651q6/we_should_have_an_adult_version_of_the_book_fairs/,642,1568876130.0,"So basically like the scholastic book fair that would come around every year to your school, but for adults. It would have all that years new releases and best sellers, comic books and graphic novels, and a bunch of other stuff (like pop figures, collectibles, shirts, etc.) Thanks for coming to my TED talk.",2019-09-19 14:55:30
