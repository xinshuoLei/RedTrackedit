I’m realizing my question is actually more specifically “Why does 2° matter so much when the temperature outside varies by far more than that every afternoon?”

I understand that it has impacts with the ocean and butterfly effects. I’m just not quite understanding *how* it’s so devastating, when 2° seems like such a small shift I would barely even feel it. Just from the nature of seasonal change, I’d think the world is able to cope with such minor degree shifts. 

It’s not like a human body where a tiny change becomes an uncomfortable fever. The world (seems?) more resilient than a body to substantial temperature changes, even from morning to afternoon. 

And no, I’m not a climate change denier. I’m trying to understand the details. Deniers, please find somewhere else to hang your hat. I am not on your team.

**Proper Edit 2 and Ninja Edit 3**
I need to go to sleep. I wasn’t expecting this to get so many upvotes, but I’ve read every comment. Thank you to everyone! I will read new comments in the morning. 

Main things I’ve learned, based on Redditors’ comments, for those just joining:

* **Average global temp** is neither *local weather outside*, nor is it *weather on a particular day*. It is the *average weather for the year across the globe.* Unfortunately, this obscures the fact that the temp change is dramatically uneven across the world, making it seem like a relatively mild climate shift. Most things can handle 2° warmer local weather, since that happens every day, sometimes even from morning to afternoon. Many things can’t handle 2° warmer *average global weather.* They are not the same. For context, [here is an XKCD](https://xkcd.com/1732/) explaining that the avg global temp during the ice age 22,000 years ago (when the earth was frozen over) was just ~4° less than it is today. The ""little ice age"" was just ~1-2° colder than today. Each degree in avg global temp is substantial.

* While I'm sure it's useful for science purposes, it is unfortunate that we are using the metric of *average global temp*, since normal laypeople don't have experience with what that actually means. **This is what was confusing me.**

* The equator takes in most of the heat and shifts it upwards to the poles. The dramatic change in temp at the poles is actually what will cause most of the problems. It only takes a few degrees for ice to melt and cause snowball effects (pun intended) to the whole ecosystem. 

* Extreme weather changes, coastal cities being flooded, plants, insects, ocean acidity, and sealife will be the first effects. Mammals can regulate heat better, and humans can adapt. However, the impacts to those other items will screw up the whole food chain, making species go extinct or struggle to adapt when they otherwise could’ve. Eventually that all comes back to humans, as we are at the top of the food chain, and will be struggling to maintain our current farming crop yields (since plants would be affected). 

* The change in global average (not 2° local) can also make some current very hot but highly populated areas uninhabitable. Not everywhere has the temperatures of San Francisco or London. On the flip side, it's possible some currently icy areas will become habitable, though there is no guarantee that it will be fertile land.

* The issue is not the 2° warmer temp. It is that those 2° could be the tipping point at which it becomes a runaway train effect. Things like ice melting and releasing more methane, or plants struggling and absorbing less C02. The 2° difference can quickly become 20°. The 2° may be our event horizon. 

* Fewer plants means less oxygen for terrestrial life. [Precision Edit: I’m being told that [higher C02 is *better* for plants](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/carbon-dioxide-fertilization-greening-earth), and our oxygen comes from ocean life. I’m still unclear on the details here.]

* A major part of the issue is the timing. It’s not just that it’s happening, it’s that it’s happens over tens of years instead of thousands. There’s no time for life to adapt to the new conditions. 

* We don’t actually know exactly what will happen because it’s impossible to predict, but we know that it will be a restructuring of life and the food chain. Life as we know it today is adapted to a particular climate and that is about to be upended. When the dust settles, Earth will go on. Humans might not. Earth has been warm before, but not when humans were set up to depend on farming the way we are today.",2018-10-09 17:26:58

Edit 2: To elaborate. Many are saying things like time is a constant and cannot slow, and while that might be true, for the layman, the question being truly asked is how does gravity have an affect on how time is perceived, and of course, all the shenanigans that come with such phenomena.

I would also like to say, as much as I, and others, appreciate the answers and discussion happening, keep in mind that the goal is to explain a concept simply, however possible, right? Getting into semantics about what kind of relativity something falls under, while interesting and even auxiliary, is somewhat superfluous in trying to grasp the simpler details.

A customer is unreasonable and/or abusive, and makes a complaint. Despite evidence of the opposite (including cameras and other employee witnesses), why does HR or management always opt to punish the employee rather than ban the customer? Alternatively, why are abusive, destructive, or otherwise problem-causing customers given free stuff or discounts and invited to return to cause the same problems?

I don't know much about how things work on the HR side, but I feel like it takes more time, energy, and money to hire, train, write tax info for, and fire employees rather than to just ban or refuse to bend over backwards for an unreasonable customer. All you have to say is ""no"" and lose out on that $1000 or so that customer might bring every year rather than spend twice that much on a high turnover rate.

I know multibillion dollar companies are famous for this in the sense that they don't want to ""lose customers"", but there are plenty of mom and pop or independently owned stores that take a ""no BS"" policy with customers and still stand strong on the business end.
