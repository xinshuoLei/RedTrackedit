"I’m Aaron Glantz, investigative reporter at Reveal and the author of Homewreckers. Let’s talk about the close associates of Donald Trump — like Steve Mnuchin, Wilbur Ross, Tom Barrack, and Jared Kushner— who made billions off the housing crisis. AMA.",2402,dmyp7y,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/dmyp7y/im_aaron_glantz_investigative_reporter_at_reveal/,163,1572044611.0,"I'm Aaron Glantz, senior investigative reporter for Reveal and the author of Homewreckers: How a Gang of Wall Street Kingpins, Hedge Fund Magnates, Crooked Banks, and Vulture Capitalists Suckered Millions Out of Their Homes and Demolished the American Dream.
 
It all started with a piece on Tom Barrack Jr, Trump’s oldest friend and inauguration chairman, who used the housing bust to buy 30,000 homes. From there, I homed in on a single house: a 834-foot bungalow in South L.A, where 5 members of the Trump administration had profited off personal pain and financial dispossession. After that, I investigated Steve Mnuchin’s OneWest Bank, and then broke news on modern-day redlining in 61 cities – including Philadelphia, Atlanta, San Antonio, and Washington, D.C.
